Job title: Remote mojolicious / full-stack web developer

Company name: MoveGB

Internal ID: Perl Jobs (remote)

Location: Bath, UK

Pay rate: ~1500GBP/month

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 6+ months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We believe in properly flexible hours, working from home (or wherever you
want), and value good code over hours at a desk. Escape the structure of a
traditional job and work when you’re in the right mindset, and do something
else when you’re not.

We’re looking for remote developers to join our distributed team, and offer
a broad and interesting role – one day might be working on customer facing
pages, another on an API integration, a third building batch data
manipulation jobs. We believe good engineers choose the right tools for the
task at hand, and will let you play to your strengths / take on the tasks
you enjoy.

MoveGB provides access to hundreds of fitness venues (gym, swim, climbing,
squash, yoga etc.) for a single monthly fee. Think iTunes or Spotify for
fitness.

After a hugely successful launch in Bath and Bristol, we're on a mission to
scale up our service to the whole of the UK, and are already trialling
membership in the US.

Required skills:
We're looking for passionate engineers with a mix of back-end perl /
front-end web skills. If you can bring solid knowledge of the following
areas, we’d love to hear from you:

Perl’s mojolicious framework (or similar)
CSS/Javascript frameworks (e.g. twitter-bootsrap, angularJS)
SQL databases (we use MySQL)

Ideally you’ll have some experience of developing in a team, as the
distributed nature of our company means we'll expect you to get on with
stuff without much supervision.

Desired skills:
Any of the following would also be useful, but by no means required:
Devops (AWS, puppet, chef etc)
Mobile app development
Wearable devices
Security
Growth-hacking, A/B testing
