Description:
** This is a contract-to-hire position **

If this candidate works out for the contract duration, we intend to hire
this person full-time.	You will also be required to use one of eBay's
approved contracting firms for this position, during the contract phase, no
exceptions.

We are looking for a Web developer who is a specialist in front-end
presentation engineering while also comfortable with server-side
application development.  You will be developing applications on a very
high-traffic LAMP platform, built on a Linux/Apache/mod_perl architecture,
with HTML::Mason and HTML::Template utilized for a multi-lingual
presentation tier.  The application layer utilizes XML-based messaging over
HTTP to communicate with enterprise systems.  Development will be done in
English (UTF-8), and then localized for testing and release.  You must be
familiar with source control (preferably ClearCase) and bug tracking
systems, as well as full Product Development Life-Cycles (PDLC).  The ideal
candidate must have a responsible, diligent work ethic, self-starter, be
willing to ask questions, and have a desire to do things "the right way"
rather than "just make it work".  Also, must be comfortable in a Unix/Linux
environment, using BASH, SSH, Vi(Vim), etc.

Our team's major tasks include numerous custom or "tailored" shopping
experiences for eBay.  This platform also runs two of the current
international eBay sites (extra points if you guess which ones); we get
100's of millions of page views per month.

Required skills:
- 4+ yrs overall experience with high-availability web applications
- HTML DOM, CSS, Java Script (Cross-browser),
- AJAX (familiarity with prototype.js is a plus)
- Web Graphic production (manipulation of gif, animated gif, jpeg images)
- Perl scripting (CGI or mod_perl)
- XML
- Unix-or-Linux platforms, SSH, basic shell commands: ps, find, rsync, etc.

- Unicode (UTF-8)

Desired skills:
- Apache web server configuration, internals, modules, performance tuning
- Perl:  OO Perl, mod_perl, HTML::Mason, HTML::Template, XML::Simple, DBI,
performance tuning, profiling, creating and installing modules
- Localization processes, character encoding (ISO*, UTF-16, UTF-8, Big5
...)
- Database skills, SQL92
- General Unix/Linux sysadmin skills
