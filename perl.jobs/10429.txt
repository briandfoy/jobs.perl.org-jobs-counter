Description:
Exciting opportunities available for Perl Developers looking to join a
growing firm in the city as they move forward on a series of new product
development efforts!

Our client is a stable, profitable, privately-held online business.  We've

Their CTO is a laidback, hands-off manager looking for people who enjoy
work and are comfortable in a team environment.

We're looking for engineers at all levels of experience as long as you have
at least 2 years of dedicated Perl development experience. 

Ideal candidates will have experience working on high-traffic web projects,
