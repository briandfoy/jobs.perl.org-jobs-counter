Job title: Senior daemon programmer for ISV

Company name: Remasys Pty Ltd

Location: Australia, Victoria, Melbourne

Pay rate: 65K to 85K AUD package

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Remasys is looking to hire a senior Perl programmer.  We need someone who
is very comfortable with programming in a linux environment, using CPAN and
mysql.	This is not a web/html job, instead the primary focus will be on
improving/extending the functionality of a set of unix daemons and helping
with the installation/setup of Remasys software at new client sites.   An
additional responsibility will be maintaining the build environment.  

Remasys is actively engaged in maintaining and selling two products, a
systems management product and a file transfer product that you will be
required to maintain and extend. 

As part of the job, you will get exposed to a wide variety of protocols,
rfcs and software installations and expected to get involved with
understanding, mapping out and automating complex environments as well as
creating tools to make it easier to carry out these processes.

Our office is on flinders st opposite federation square, quite close to the
station.  We have a small group of skilled people working in a open plan
environment and the development model would be classified as agile. The
director comes from a technical background, so it is easy to discuss
requirements and make proposals for improvements.  Required overtime is
definitely the exception rather the rule and time-in-lieu is happily
granted on all such occasions.

As an additional bonus, we host Melbourne Perl Mongers every month, so you
don't need to travel too far if you want to attend.

Required skills:
* Perl (probably at least 2 years full time programming experience)
* Linux
* Australian citizenship

Desired skills:
* Familiarity with branching and tagging
* Knowledge of the FHS
* Familiarity with atomic filesystem operations
* Any experience at all with Win32 gui programming
* Experience with rpms
