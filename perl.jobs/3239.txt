Description:
We provide over 300 of America’s most successful retailers and catalogers

based on superior technology and innovation.

Each of our rich media applications follows a common design methodology. We
take existing visual content (images, catalogs, video) and optimize it for
online purposes through the addition of interactivity, animation and
integration with standard e-commerce components like shop systems, site
metrics, site search etc. All our rich media presentations are top-notch
client-server web applications used by millions of consumers. They are
automatically generated by our proprietary set of rich-media generation
tools, embedded in our Web ASP platform. 


Required skills:
•At least 5 years of hands-on experience in designing and implementation of
enterprise-level web applications.
•familiarity with both back-end and front-end web technologies. Hands-on
development experience with Perl, on Linux and Apache. In addition
equivalent experience with either .NET, or, J2EE is plus.
•Experience with large storage systems, and large hosting facilities is a
plus. 
•Prior experience with imaging and/or publishing systems is a plus.
•A team player with excellent communication skills.
