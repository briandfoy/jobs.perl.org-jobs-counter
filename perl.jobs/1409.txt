Job title: entry level web developer

Company name: I Do Foundation

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Pay rate: negotiable, but at nonprofit levels

Travel: 0%

Length of employment: temp-to-perm

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
The I Do Foundation, a small but growing nonprofit organization, is looking
to grow its technical staff from two to three people.  The primary purpose
of this staff is to support and expand an existing suite of online
applications that promote charitable giving programs.  The team member
would be expected to do a bit of everything, from mundane html content
updates to developing new features for the website.

The site runs with a series of perl applications which overlay a base of
object oriented perl packages and a MySQL back end.

This is an entry-level position, but we hope that with the right candidate
it would grow into a mid and even senior level position as the employee
progresses.  The position would begin on an hourly trial basis, and after a
period of approximately three months, a decision will be made about a
full-time offer.

Telecommuting most of the time will be perfectly fine, but occasional
in-person meetings in the Philadelphia or DC areas would be expected,
especially after the employee becomes full-time.  Therefore, an east-coast
person would likely be a better fit, but for the right candidate, we can be
flexible.

Required skills:
perl, html, some javascript, familiarity with sql, ability to work in a
unix environment, ability to work remotely most of the time and still be
effective with little supervision.

Desired skills:
MySQL, photoshop, design and editing experience.

We are also happy to work with volunteers, and have done so successfully in
the past.  As with all volunteer opportunities, it is crucial that the
volunteer really buy in to the message of the organization, and that the
organization be respectful of that volunteer's time.  If you'd like to know
more, please inquire.
