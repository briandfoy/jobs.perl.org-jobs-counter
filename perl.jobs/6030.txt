Description:
Thanks to our great write-up on TechCrunch* we’re growing fast and need
fearless Perl professionals to join us in this outstanding opportunity as
we continue to grow something really unique while having great times doing
so.

You will work closely with our core team to design and implement features
and deploy them to our live service.

*http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/31/magnifynet-different-than-the-video-c
rowd/


* If you have an established contracting rate or a target salary range,
please pass that along.

Setting:

* Telecommuting is OK, however periodical participation of on-site
development meeting will be require, so the candidate will have to be
within a commutable range of NYC.

Required skills:
* Significant knowledge of and experience in Perl programming. (Exposure to
standard Perl idioms, the ability to create your own class hierarchies, and
familiarity with CPAN are required.)

* Prior experience in server-side web application development. (You should
have worked with multiple page templating systems, session data storage,
relational databases, caching, and inter-process communication.)

* Understanding of professional software development processes. (Including
familiarity with the cycles of requirements definition, issue tracking,
version control, automated testing, deployment and maintenance.)

* Clear and articulate communication, both written and spoken. (Our team
collaborates extensively by email, IM, and phone, and you will need to be
able to read specs and write documentation)
Applications:

* Please apply by email and attach or link to your resume or portfolio, in
HTML, PDF, or plain text format.

* If you've released modules on CPAN, are a poster on Perl Monks, or have a
stash of sample code somewhere on your web site, please include a link to
the relevant pages.

Desired skills:
(not required, but would be a plus)

* Web service operation, scaling, and fault-tolerance using Linux, Apache,
MySQL, and Perl.

* Experience with our server-side toolset, including mod_perl, HTML::Mason,
DBIx::SQLEngine, Cache::Memcached, and other modules from CPAN.

* User interfaces are constructed in HTML with CSS and JavaScript (using
Prototype and Scriptaculous for Ajax and client-side effects),RSS feeds,
XML APIs, and client-side Flash widgets.

* Project support tools including RT, SVN, and automated web testing.
