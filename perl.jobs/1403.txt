Job title: Cool People Needed

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, Waltham

Pay rate: $40-60K

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for some cool people to help us make the lives of healthcare
providers easier.

It helps a lot if you know perl, or have a lot of confidence that you can
pick it up on a dime.  RDBMS experience, especially Oracle, would also be
most excellent.

The emphasis here is on results. You've got to love working with all types
of people, and then using your mad coding skillz to deliver visible,
bottom-line value. Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to
you. The development environment is friendly and open. Work-life balance is
respected and encouraged. The folks you'll be working with are all top
notch, and will probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've
ever worked with regardless of where you're coming from.

The company itself is one of the brightest stars in the pre-IPO universe,
if we do say so ourselves.  We've been around for about 6 years now; we
were originally backed with $40 million in venture capital from A-list VC's
(Venrock, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Cardinal Health Partners, and Oak), but
the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise any more
capital.

At this point, we're looking for a few good developers & QA test engineers
to hire immediately; salary range is $40-60K plus options and benefits,
depending on experience. The company continues to grow, so there are
significant advancement opportunities for ambitious folks.

If you're interested, shoot your resume over, and we'll get back to you
quickly. Unfortunately, you really ought to live somewhere in the general
vicinity of Boston for us to consider you; we're located in downtown
Waltham. We expect to do interviews next week and make decisions relatively
quickly.

You can send your resume to me, Ed Park (perl -e '$_ =
"eparkATathenahealth.com";  s/AT/\@/; print;'). I'm the Chief Software
Architect over here; I'm directly involved in hiring because I think it's
one of the most important things a company can do.

Looking forward to hearing from you!


Required skills: Perl. & being cool.

Desired skills:
A desire to fix the godawful mess that is healthcare in the America. Oh,
and Oracle, or something similar.
