Description:
Looking to have some time keeping scripts rewritten. There are two scripts,
one that dumps employee clock in and clock out time into postgres using
epoch time, and the other that grabs the previous days epoch time and runs
a diff against them to calculate hours. The scripts also send daily email
reports of all employee hours, missing, and incorrect.

It is buggy and in need of a overhaul.

This is a contract gig, not to exceed $500.

Required skills: perl, postgresql (pgsql)
