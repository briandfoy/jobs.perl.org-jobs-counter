Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Description:
Hi, 

*No sponsorship for work visas* 
My client is looking for a strong Perl programmer to join our team for a
mid term contract position. The primary role is to support a team of
AIX/Linux engineers. As scripts/programs are needed for different projects,
requirements are driven from the engineers and the program will need to
write what is needed. Having someone that has a Unix/Linux admin background
is highly desired. This is a pure Perl role, however understanding the
underlining platform will be very beneficial.

Required skills:
Perl 5
mysql/db2/postgresql via DBI
CPAN
Module creation
Ability to work with more advanced data structures, hash of hashs, array of
hashs, etc. 
Clear understanding and use of regex

This is 100% onsite in Lansing, MI, M-F 8-5.

Desired skills: Catalyst framework is a bonus
