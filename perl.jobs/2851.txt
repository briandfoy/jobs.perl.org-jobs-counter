Masterfile is a visual content provider -- a stock image agency which

controlled use around the world. With a head office located in Toronto,
business development offices in Seattle, New York and Chicago, and a
network of strategic alliances in 35 other countries, we are the largest
stock library in Canada and a major player internationally.

As Masterfile's image collection grows, and we integrate and process a
large volume of images from a variety of sources, we need to efficiently
manage an increasingly complex workflow.

We are seeking a detail-oriented, motivated and adaptable individual for
the position of Image Processing Technician. Working with the Production
Manager and Project Coordinator, the successful candidate will operate,
maintain and improve various automated image processing workflows, running
on Mac OS X, and held together primarily with Perl.

Responsibilities:

- operate and maintain various digital image processing workflows which
handle a large volume of image files daily
	
- monitor image quality to ensure correct colour and data integrity
	
- improve, adapt and optimize image processing workflows
	
- manage metadata in databases and text files
	
- handle ad hoc image processing requests
	
- communicate and work with Masterfile staff, image suppliers and
distributors regarding image processing and content syndication
		
- research image processing and workflow technology and practices to
further improve quality and efficiency


Required skills:
- at least 1 year experience writing scripts for workflow automation, using
Perl (preferred), AppleScript, or other scripting languages

- basic knowledge of Unix and shell scripting (we are using Mac OS X); must
be comfortable on the command line
	
- at least 2 years experience with production workflows, e.g. pre-press
workflows
	
- an excellent understanding of colour management (e.g. ICC profiles),
image files formats and image compression is essential
	
- good knowledge of Adobe Photoshop - especially colour management and
automation
	
- good understanding of Internet protocols: HTTP, FTP, SSH

- excellent interpersonal skills are required


Desired skills:
- knowledge of SQL and Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL would be an asset
	
- experience with command line image processing tools, such as sips or
Image Magick, would be an asset
