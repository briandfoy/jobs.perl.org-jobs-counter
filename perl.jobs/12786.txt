Description:
Hi

I have a number of Perl scripts with me- these are invoked from CGI files.

Now, I want you to create a simple parser that reads through the CGI files
and retrieves details about all the functionalities in each of those CGI
files, and corresp. Perl functions that are invoked for each of those
functionalities. Your parser can be in any language-- only, you need to
know CGI and Perl scripting, so that you can actually create the parser
which processes CGI+Perl code.

I want your parser to generate the spreadsheet (with detailed information
about all functionalities->cgi script invoking that functionality-> perl
script containing corresp function -> function details (incl comments or
helpful docs pulled from source)-> params of function-> manner in which
those params are passed to that function from the CGI script (eg one
param-> text box named 'userid', one param->field 'x' from table 'y' having
field userid= value in field 'userid' ) + any other perl script dependency
required by this function to run correctly.

Another additional requirement-->  it would be great if your parser could
also run through code and generate a simple diff between an older
spreadsheet previously generated by same parser and current spreadsheet
generated by the parser-- this should be very simple-- I basically want to
know the differences. 

In addition to this, I also want the parser to modify the CGI page code--
so that it uses a HTML template module that uses inline perl. This allows
HTML templates to be used for the web pages that invoke perl code. At the
same time, since Perl code is inline, so the perl code you parsed can be
used with no or minimal change. You can use any one of the following inline
perl html template frameworks-- HTML::Mason, HTML::Embperl, Apache::ASP--
all I want is that you use a framework that has support for parsing and
processing XML documents (This will be required by me for further dev on
your processed code).

Please visit
http://perl.apache.org/docs/tutorials/tmpl/comparison/comparison.html --  
to read more about popular modules for HTML template usage-- just use an
inline perl based HTML framework from that page. 

Ideally, can you generate snippets for each functionality clearly
demarcated? So that I can pick and choose any one functionality- and put it
somewhere else-- for this I will need some way to clearly identify one
functionality in the CGI and its corresp. call in the HTML template (as per
HTML template)-- this also includes any field which is entered into a text
box etc by user in original CGI script-- corresp. text box should be there
in the newly generated HTML template as well (basically replication of same
functionality-- only with use of HTML template Perl module)

Using HTML Template for Perl is very simple-- basically a function call
either returns a single value or a list-- and there are simple constructs
to be added to the HTML (like regular HTML tags) for a single value or a
list of values... You can go through the above URL and understand how it
works in 5 minutes.

One sample cluster of CGI+Perl files is attached with this project-- I have
many such collections of CGI+Perl files which need to be processed by your
parser correctly- I can provide as many of these files to you as possible.

Do get back to me in case you have any queries or questions.

If you want you can directly put in a request with your cost estimate at
