Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £25-35k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Description:
The Client is an online education company providing online and interactive
revision, study, exams, videos, reading content, jobs listings and many
other services for doctors, hospitals and medical universities.

They seek a Senior PERL Web Developer to join our small, vibrant team
located in the heart of Central London.

The position will require you to work both autonomously and with others,
leading projects, training and working within a small, friendly team.

The candidate will have a track record of maintaining their code with
meaningful comments and keeping well-written documentation.

Although the Client specialises in providing resources for doctors, no
previous medical knowledge is required.

Selection will be by interview, at which candidates may be asked to provide
examples of their code if they have not already done so upon application.

Extensive knowledge and experience of Perl (including object oriented
Perl), a strong knowledge of SQL (preferably including exposure to MySQL)
and the Web Development process are essential. The successful candidate
will have relevant experience or strong familiarity in working within and
running all aspects of a popular website.

Knowledge of PHP is desirable and an understanding of HTML, CSS and
JavaScript is desirable; knowledge of the Template Toolkit Perl module
would also be helpful but is not essential. A background in Linux (and
Systems Administration) would be an advantage. A high standard of written
English is required. 

Required skills:
Perl = excellent
PHP
MySql
Linux
