Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: ZipRecruiter

Location: Santa Monica, CA

Pay rate: Salaried

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
ZipRecruiter is looking to expand our engineering team. We are a successful
startup (~6 years old, ~350 employees) and we're still growing rapidly. 

We help employers and recruiters distribute their jobs online and screen
their applicants. We also provide a job search engine and job alert email
for job seekers and other job boards. We have a large number of paying
customers and job seekers using our services. You will have the opportunity
to lead significant projects. We pay market competitive salaries and offer
generous cash bonuses and equity. We are more laid back than the average
startup and more fun than the average BigCo. 

We're looking for strong
generalist engineers who are happy to learn new technologies, and are
willing to think like product/business people who personally implement
software. 

Technologies we use: 

Perl, Python, MySQL, Amazon Web
Services, Elasticsearch, Ubuntu 


We prefer candidates to be based with us
in Santa Monica, CA, but we're open to remote as well.

Desired skills:
Solid software design skills! 

Perl programming in a Linux/Unix
environment!

SQL!

AWS!
 
Elasticsearch!
 
Testing Automation!
