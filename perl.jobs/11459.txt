Job title: Lead Engineer - modperl/LAMP/jQuery/python

Company name: Shiftboard

Location: United States, Washington, Seattle

Pay rate: DOE - Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is not a bureaucracy. We are seeking a technologically passionate,
motivated engineer with significant real-world experience (in at least a
few areas below) to dive in, head-first.

If you want to build very new, relevant products used by a lot of people
around the world, keep reading.

We experiment with new techniques and technologies, and we think a lot
about efficient mobile access. We implement exotic caching strategies, ship
tools to various app exchanges, and work to automate all areas of
administration. For customers, we have a solid, JSON-oriented API and we
use it ourselves.  We do things like OpenID, virtualization, and at least
some of us have fun squeezing the last bits of efficiency by doing client
and server-side caching tricks. We build for Chrome, Firefox and webkit,
but know that we must still respect IE 8.

Sound interesting?  Experience matters: A qualified, software engineer will
need to have at least 5 (if not 10 or more) years of experience working
within open source-oriented web architectures.

Above all else, the right engineer will have solid Unix shell, scripting,
networking, and systems administration experience.

If you have at least a few of the qualities listed below and are looking to
join a tightly-focused team working on a highly engaging product serving
hundreds of industries with millions of transactions around the world, this
could be the perfect job.
