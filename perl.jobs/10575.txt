Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: UK2.net

Internal ID: PP1

Location: United Kingdom, London, London

Pay rate: £negotiatble

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Description:
Good perl programmers needed for an ongoing project to improve and add new
functionality to our hosting platform and billing engine. We have one of
the cleanest code bases out there and constantly have new projects
including new features that we need to add to our entirely perl back-end
codebase.

Depending on your specialist skill sets there are opportunities to work on
front end web applications or infrastructure interaction as well as
squashing those ever present and pesky bugs.

In return we offer excellent renumeration, the chance to hang out in yet
another perl IRC channel, no admin work whatsoever and the opportunity to
be a part of taking our raw but ultra clean back-end code and perfecting it
to such a point of glimmering shininess that it becomes brighter than the
sun (or as close as humanly possible). 


Required skills:
2-3 yrs Perl programming experience

2-3 yrs experience with Unix-based systems (systems administration or Perl
development).

Excellent knowledge of common Internet protocols (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, DNS,
Whois)

Excellent Perl programming skills, including Object Orientated development,
debugging, test-driven development, POD documentation and common CPAN
modules (CGI, DBI, HTML: Template)

2 - 3 years solid SQL (particularly MySQL)

Good Unix skills, including shell scripting & database administration

A love of things Perl

Desired skills:
Good level of standards based HTML and CSS experience

Experience in the domain registration / web hosting market

Linux/Unix system administration experience (don't worry, we won't make you
do much sysad work, we have sysads for that)

Encyclopedic knowledge of PHP developer jokes
