Description:
I am looking for a freelance perl developer. knowledge of bbc
infrastructure ideal, though I can arrange an induction session. the work
is for bbc english regions who run 40 or so where I live sites staffed by
around 120 people. work is based in bush house, london.

three projects that need attention:

forms for english regions production teams to generate xml - initially
producing headlines for use in my bbc, index pages and on external sites.
next phase is to extend to generating explicitly tagged content for Dcable
and as ssis for websites [in other words a cheeky cps]

user comments system - comments form to go on any web page, generates ssis.
production teams  have web tool to manage comments they want published -
slight complexity in that there are 40 odd er sites each of which would use
the form on multiple pages, so some work to do to make production end
usable [same goes for the xml form]

weather include - working with bbc weather center to produce weather
includes usable across all 40 sites. includes will need to be customisable
within each site. also involves interfacing with postcode db.

I need to be able to agree deadlines/priorities with the developer working
on these and be confident those deadlines will be met.


Required skills: perl. html.
