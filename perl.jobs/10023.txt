Job title:
Perl Developer for company in Toronto, Ontario

Company name: OANDA (Canada)  Corporation ULC

Location: Canada, Ontario, Toronto

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Why OANDA?

It’s really pretty simple. OANDA is a unique company. It's not a Web
upstart or a bank. It’s a technology company that innovates both in
computer engineering and financial modelling for the Foreign Currency
Exchange Trade market. 

OANDA has experienced continued growth since its founding in 1996, and
opportunities for employees are unprecedented as the company creates new
products that redefine the forex market. With a daily capitalization of $3
trillion, the forex market dwarfs both the US bond and equity markets. 

What's at the root of OANDA's success? A culture of transparency and
openness, and a continued focus on constantly developing innovative
technology. At OANDA, you will work under the leadership of computer
science and economics experts in an almost lab-like environment. You will
develop and challenge your skills every day. You will have the ability to
be self-directed in your work within a collaborative team structure. You’ll
enjoy the immediacy of a small company, but use the most advanced
tools/technologies that a large firm can offer. And to maintain that
community feel at OANDA we offer flexibility & sociability with things like
a concierge service, on-site massage therapist, weekly Wed lunch, Friday @
4 gatherings and more. You will contribute to the growth and direction of
OANDA, and your contributions to the success of the company will be
recognized and rewarded. Located in downtown Toronto, the OANDA development
office provides convenient access to public transit and other downtown
amenities. 

The Developer:

Developers are critical to OANDA’s business success as a software company;
our products are only as good as the people who create them. With that in
mind, OANDA looks for highly intelligent, innovative, and dedicated
technology professionals.

Working within a Linux / Solaris environment, the Developer will research,
design, test, implement, and maintain online and back end trading and data
services infrastructure applications focusing within PERL. The successful
candidate will work closely with OANDA’s technical leadership to understand
business requirements, and will collaborate with development team members
to design and write applications systems and programs. S/he will
participate in project management and will contribute to the architecture
and design process of the Internet site. S/he will test and debug
applications to ensure proper performance, and will be responsible for
developing/modifying program documentation. The Developer will also develop
an extensive knowledge of OANDA’s computing and business environment.


Required skills:
The Skills You Bring:
•At least 2 years of professional working experience in a software
engineering role. (Industry experience in the foreign exchange, financial
services, or other industry with high transaction volumes is preferred.)
•A University degree in computer science, computer engineering, or a
related field. A graduate degree would be an asset.
•Solid development experience using Perl and mod Perl.
•Experience using Javascript, Python, Ruby, HTML is an asset
•Experience with UNIX / Linux / Solaris operating systems.
•Relevant experience in the development of Internet-ready applications
programs using Internet communications protocols (TCP/IP).
•Proven ability to innovate in ways that contribute to the success of the
business.
•A strong team orientation combined with the drive and ability to
contribute at the individual level.
•Exceptional communications skills – both oral and written.
•Database programming experience (preferably in DB2 and MySQL).
•Knowledge of trading protocols such as FIX, CMS, etc. would be a bonus.
