Job title:
Consuming Large Web Service Payloads in Perl

Location: United States, NY, New York

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 Weeks

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're currently using the open source SOAP::Lite module to interop with
.Net applications via web services in an effort to consume large amounts of
data (70 MB +).  We've found that the SOAP::Lite module blows-up the memory
footprint to at least 7x the payload while processing the SOAP messages,
and we're running in to resource issues.  This likely occurs because the
SOAP::Lite module is building up an expensive DOM representation of the
SOAP message.  

The goal of this project is to build a streamlined web services client that
is capable of streaming in and parsing large SOAP messages.  

Required skills:
Expertise in Perl programming with extensive experience with HTTP, SOAP,
XML, Authentication, and all the associated open source Perl modules
