Job title: Unix Systems Programmer

Company name: Oxford University Computing Services

Location: United Kingon, Oxford

Pay rate:  £

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our expanding Systems Development and Support Team has vacancies for Unix
Systems Programmers. Your enthusiasm and attention to detail will be your
greatest assets. The work involves systems architecture design, software
development and service support. At Oxford, the Computing Services
(http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/) is home to more activities than you might
imagine.  We take on research and teaching within the department as well as
providing services and a help centre for more than 30,000 users.  New
facilities to support teaching, research and administration are developed
here and OUCS is a pioneer in many areas. There are many other advantages
to working at the University other than the world-class research culture.
Benefits include flexible working hours, a good pension, career prospects
and excellent holidays.

Required skills:
Do you have an interest in Unix systems administration? Are you gaining an
in-depth understanding of GNU/Linux systems administration?  Do you have
Perl programming experience or an understanding of computer security
issues?  If you have experience in any of these areas, we would like to
hear from you.

Desired skills:
As well as experience in some of the areas mentioned above, a knowledge of
C or Java would be an advantage.  You will often be expected to work on
your own initiative, and will need good organizational and communication
skills.  Your ability to learn and respond rapidly will be considered as
important as experience.
