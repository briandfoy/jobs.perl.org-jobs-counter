our client.  There needs to be a simple search engine that creates up to 10
 results at a time based on the HTML files produced. There will be a link
on each html page on all job orders taking the client to  Domain_1's 
membership forum. A hidden variable also sent with the cookie will indicate
what job the potential member was looking to apply for.

upon a provided template.
3] 47 html category pages will then need to be created listing all jobs by
category. These don't need to be navigated since they are primarily for the

results.

forward navigation provided for the overs.
