Job title: Perl / Catalyst programmers for contract work

Company name: Ionzero 

Internal ID: CatalystPerl

Location: United States, CO, Fort Collins

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months to perm

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Interested in Modern Perl programming including tools such as Moose,
DBIx::Class and Catalyst? We are looking for one or two developers to join
our
team on a 3 month contract basis, with the possibility of extension, after
the
initial contract.

Ionzero is a software development consultancy company. We have customers
around the US and around the world. Our job is to figure out how our
customers' software can be better, and then make it so. We set out to
create
the kind of company we always wanted to work for where there were good
people,
interesting projects, solid software and flexible (and reasonable) hours.
We've accomplished that for the last 6 years and now our business is
expanding
faster than ever before.

We work in many languages (Perl, PHP, Java, whatever our customers need)
but
right now we are looking for programmers with Perl experience, preferably
using modern tools such as Moose, Catalyst and DBIx::Class. CPAN knowledge
is
a must. Published modules on CPAN are a BIG plus.

Our clients are all over the place, so you need to be able to work well via

email and our project management system. You must be self motivated and we
expect that if you say you will do something, you will. You won't last in
this
job if you don't. But if you CAN do that and write good solid code, we want
to
talk to you. Knowledge of Spanish a HUGE plus.

This is a contract three month telecommute position. We have staff all over

the world. If you're nearby, all the better. The position is contract to
start, with the possibility go permanent.

If this all sounds good to you, send a resume along with sample code and
your salary requirements.

Required skills:
* Modern Perl (and Object Oriented tools like Moose)

* Catalyst web framework

* SQL databases (particularly MySQL and Postgresql)

* Familiarity with CPAN

* Web technologies such as HTML / CSS / Javascript

* Version control (SVN / Git / etc.)


Desired skills:
DBIx::Class a big plus. Plack, other web technologies.	Fluency in Spanish
and English are a huge benefit.
