Job title: Fulltime onsite Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Foxtons

Internal ID: web

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate:
Market rates (depends on applicants abilities, no specific cap)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You must already be able to work in the UK.

You will be joining a small but dedicated team who are given the freedom to
excel. You must be passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology
and usability. With few formal meetings, your day might cover working with
the sysadmin, helping the designers with JavaScript, integrating with the
CRM webservices or generating google earth kml files for search results.

Recognized as the leading estate agents website in the UK (if not the
world) we want to maintain this reputation for providing cutting edge
features, without losing simplicity and usability. We also provide
solutions within the company, be this helping production by generating
quark formatted text, or replacing a MS Word based brochure system with one
which generates PDF files from configurations generated through a web GUI.


Required skills:
You will need to have strong communication skills (occasionally doing
internal presentations) and be someone who works well as part of a team and
enjoys sharing ideas and debating options. You will be expected to provide
input in the design of systems and can even venture an opinion on front end
design issues.

Core modules used in our systems:
Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Template::Toolkit, TheSwartz, MogileFS, Memcache,
Perlbal, Test::More, PDF::API2 along with hundreds of others.

Of course you will already be used to writing tests and doing code reviews.
You are also likely to have several CPAN modules, and follow the latest
technical developments, for example Moose and virtual computing even though
you may not have direct experience in them yet.
