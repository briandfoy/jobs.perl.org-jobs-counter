Job title:
Re-Branding Social Networking Site (Perl backend, but mostly HTML/JS work)

Company name: Mindcast Software

Location: United States, Washington, Mill Creek

Pay rate: $15USD per hour 

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 80-100 hours

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Most of the work in this project involves updating HTML/Javascript
templates and replacing images.  The backend is written in Perl, so I
prefer someone versed in Perl who can trace through the code and figure out
where to make the necessary updates.  PSDs of the new branded "look and
feel" will be provided, so you will need Photoshop.

Required skills:
Hand Coded HTML/Javascript/Perl :)

-- Fluent English (I need to be able to quickly and effectively communicate
design concepts.)

-- Design Intuition (I need someone who can build out the HTML from a PSD
without explicit instructions like "move this object 10 pixels to the
right", etc...)


Desired skills:
Photoshop
Linux(CentOS)
MySQL
