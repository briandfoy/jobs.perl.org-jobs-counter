Description:

We are currently seekin Perl programmers to complete a small project within
the 'www.iagora.com' website. The budget for this project is 500 Euros and
the project should take less than 20 hours for completion. We expect bids
varying in number of hours required and total cost. 

We will retain the best bids and assess the quality of the programming to
turn it into an on-going, long-term participation in the maintainance and
further development of the website.

iAgora.com is a large website written in the LAMP (Linux-Apache-Mysql-Perl)
platform, using an open-source templating system running on
Apache/mod_perl. ( http://www.iagora.com/about/software/iact/index.html). 
Our main service is providing listings of job offers for students and
recent graduates.

We will select a freelancer by the end of next week and will need to get
the project completed the week after. If you are interested please read the
below and send us your proposal as soon as you can, mentionning:
- Total cost
- Number of hours required (our estimate is around 20 hours)
- Whether you will be able to complete the task during the week of Nov,
13th.

Project description:

To create a system of pre-paid Premium codes, which users can enter to
access our Premium services. This ties into an existing system of Affiliate
management.  Each code can be: new, used or revoked.

The operator forms allow the following actions:
 - Generate a new batch of codes.  All the codes in a batch share the
fields:
   + Start date and expiration date
   + Which affiliate (if any) these codes are related to
   + Length of time
 - Show existing batches of codes, and their statuses
 - Revoke unused codes in a batch

Entering a Premium Code will be an additional option in our payment page.
The code will be validated (vs. start date, expiration and new/used/revoked
status), and if ok, the user will be given a Premium subscription for the
right length of time, and will be associated with the right Affiliate.

To be able to work on this, you will need to install a working development
environment for iAgora on a Linux x86 PC.  Detailed instructions will be
provided for this.  You will be supervised by our main programmer (
http://www.iagora.com/~espel/index.html).


Required skills:
- Strong skills in Linux/Apache/MySQL/mod_perl web application development
- Ability to learn and work with a large pre-existing codebase.
