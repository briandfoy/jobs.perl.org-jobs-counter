Job title: Senior Back-End Engineer

Company name: Try Catch

Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands

Pay rate: â‚¬55-65k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our technical culture derives strongly from our strong ties to the Perl
community. We appreciate what open source means both for our business and
also for internal projects. Some of our most useful hacks inside the
company have come from someone scratching the proverbial itch.

Even if you
do not have Perl experience, your colleagues will help you get up to speed
in order to be able to start solving real problems from day one. You will
work independently and will also be responsible for making technical
decisions within a team. Our development strategy is agile and we work in
small Scrum teams of 5-7. We do several rollouts every day, are data-driven
and do extensive A/B testing.

Important aspects of the job include:

Rapidly develop next-generation scalable, flexible, and high-performance
systems.
Solve issues with the site and internal systems, prioritizing
based on customer impact
Act as an intermediary for problems, with both
technical and non-technical audiences
Collaborate with the team, Team
Leaders and Product Owners to prioritize projects

Desired skills:
As a Software Developer, you are responsible for the development,
performance, and scaling of our public website as well as internal systems,
which includes using: Perl (5.14), DBI, Mason, Moose, Sereal, Plack, nginx,
Javascript, MySQL, Memcached, Redis, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, git, and CentOS
Linux.

We have found that people who match the following requirements are
the ones who fit us best:

4 years of hardcore development experience with
more than one programming language
Experience of developing in and
contributing to open source
Experience with HTTP and server-side
technologies (web servers, database servers)
Ability to work independently
in small teams
Preferably a university degree in Mathematics or Software
Engineering
