Job title: Perl tutorial/article writers.

Company name: Alex

Location: Serbia & Montenegro, Serbia, Belgrade

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
This is not a clasic job posting.
I'm looking for people that would work for free.

Want to lunch a Perl related website. Something as mix of all sites that
offer Perl tips/tutorials/articles, but that would be especialy targeting
beginers.

Access would be free for all. That's why I cnt pay you.

Maybe later, we could organise the content in forms of e-books or pdf
documents that can be downloaded and printed wihtout having to download one
(article/tutorial) by one. And make people pay some small fees for that
(few bucks).

Then we would agree on how to invest the money (or share it among us :).

But my primary goal is not to earn money with this. But to get as many new
people to Perl as possible. 

Site would especialy be targeted to CGI/mod_perl programming - as I know
that best. But other things like GUI (TK and others) would also be on it,
if we find someone who will write that things.

I also want to replace the bunch of old code out there (like reading form
field via foreach statement and similar things) and promote good Perl
programming stily from the first steps.

Required skills: Just knowing some Perl ... :)

webmaster@NOSPAMtechcode.net - just remove NOSPAM from the email offcourse.
And please put JOBSPERL in subject somewhere.
