Description:
I'm looking for some help on a six to eight week engagement with a client
that is implementing a new Catalyst-based application.	The initial phase
of the development is primarily focused on creating an internal web-based
scheduling system that will eventually replace an existing PHP-based
system.

The project involves coding Perl Catalyst application with a Free BSD,
Apache, and MySQL back-end.  The application must support multiple
languages, as well as, multiple address and phone number formats, which
makes things interesting from time-to-time.

The work is a 1099 contract engagement.  The expected delivery date is
January 4th 2008.

There is no geographical limitation on who can be involved in the project,
though someone in the Chicago, IL, USA area is preferred.

Desired skills: MySQL, Git
