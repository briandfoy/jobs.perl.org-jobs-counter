Job title:
Web Software Development Manager and Applications Programmer

Company name: Maxim Integrated Products

Internal ID: job0302

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Pay rate: Competitive, based on experience

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a Web Software Development Manager/Web Application
Developer for maxim-ic.com, a Fortune-1000, business-to-business, corporate
website. You can have the variety, creativity, and financial opportunity
usually found in a small company with the resources of a very profitable
public company: Maxim Integrated Products. The position is located in
Sunnyvale  (near San Jose, California).

The website is highly strategic to the company and has very high visibility
and top management support.

You will report to the Executive Director of Internet Marketing. You will
manage six programmers in three locations. You will also do hands-on web
applications design and development. The position is estimated at 25%
management, 75% web programming.

The position is unique in several respects. Most important is that our
roles aren’t specialized — our programmers do their own database
administration, Unix admin, and user interface. We operate in a very
high-efficiency mode, beyond agile: Instead of detailed specs, elaborate
development and staging systems, and release procedures, we manage risks by
giving programmers full responsibility.

Our web developers are the very best. They are not just programmers: They
think strategically and design their apps, including user interface and
on-screen appearance and messages. They have excellent communication skills
and work with all aspects of their apps. They are responsible for their own
QA.

The programming team is responsible for all the technical aspects of
running the website: system admin, hardware and co-location, database
administration, and applications development, including user interface.

Technology: New development is Linux, Apache, Mason, Perl/Mason, MySQL.

Design philosophy is streamlined and pragmatic. The site is built for
electrical engineers, who want a fast, efficient website. While we are
up-to-speed on new technologies, we don’t implement bells and whistles
without good reason.

Our programming is presently guerilla-style: We work quickly, usually
without detailed specs or elaborate test and release procedures. User
interfaces are not prototyped in great detail, and each engineer has been
responsible for his own quality. We rely on the judgment and experience of
our programmers, rather than spending time on specs and procedures. As the
site grows, we know we will need more traditional procedures and this
position will be responsible for managing this growth and developing basic
quality assurance.

You will:

- Be responsible for day-to-day management of approximately 6 programmers,
located in Sunnyvale, CA; Dallas, TX; and Bangalore, India.

- Manage a top-tier development team of committed, effective, talented, and
creative programmers who make design and user interface decisions on their
own, without finely-detailed specs and extensive quality checks. They
generally require minimal supervision.

- Be very hands-on, with your own projects as well as supervisory
responsibilities.

- Be responsible for making sure web applications are highly usable,
attractive, professional, efficient, and conform to the look, feel, and
function of our site.

- PLEASE NOTE: YOU _MUST_ HAVE OBJECT-ORIENTED PERL EXPERIENCE!
      
Maxim is an EEO/AA Employer

Required skills:
- Three years experience managing programmers. Excellent recommendations.

- Very strong web applications experience.

- Four years experience with Object-Oriented Perl programming (mod_perl
programming desirable, Mason is a strong plus).

- Four years experience with SQL programming for a relational database
management system (MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, etc.).

- Four years experience with Linux or a Unix operating system.

- Ability to hand-code high-quality HTML, CSS, Dynamic HTML, and
Javascript.

- Excellent communication skills and written English.

- Demonstrated attention to quality and detail.

- Some travel (Dallas / Sunnyvale / Bangalore)

- Strong aesthetic sense: You can see what looks attractive and
professional and conforms to the look and feel of a site.

- Must be able to show portfolio of web applications (of your own and/or
managed) that are attractive, functional, efficient, and work well.

Desired skills:
AJAX Experience, internationalization (Unicode), mod_perl, LAMP enthusiast
