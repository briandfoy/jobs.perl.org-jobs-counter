Job title:
Seasoned developer/maintainer for small, successful eCommerce business

Company name: GEMM.com

Internal ID: gemm_dev1

Location: United States, CA, Palm Springs

Pay rate: $30

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
GEMM.com is seeking a seasoned systems engineer with extensive experience
in development and maintenance of perl / MySQL / Linux - based eCommerce
systems to join our small permanent team.

Experience with Sybase, web page design, Apache, sendmail, are a plus. 



---------------------------
BACKGROUND:

GEMM.com is currently the world's largest open marketplace for hard-to-find
music. GEMM has experienced strong, consistent growth for the past six
years and currently has healthy financials. 

So far, most of GEMM's technical development and maintenance has been
performed solely by co-founder Jim Hall. We now wish to add an additional
systems engineer  to work with Jim to expand, refine, and strengthen our
systems and take over maintenance responsibilities. Initially the work will
be part-time (about 20-30 hrs/week), but if all goes well, this will soon
become a full time position. In the long term, the role of "CTO" and some
equity in the company could ultimately be assigned to you.


----------------------------
LOCATION / TELECOMMUTE

Our company is based in Palm Springs, but technical staff currently works
from their homes in New England with only occasional visits to the main
office. As our business continues to expand, we may shift technical staff
to a Palm-Springs office based workplace however, so it's preferable that
you live in the area or are open to the possibility of moving there in the
future.


----------------------------
