Job title:
Volunteer Perl/MySQL with a passion for documentary films

Company name: e screening room

Internal ID: Jobs.perl.org -46

Location: United States, CA, San Rafael

Pay rate: Free coffee

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Perl
Wanted Volunteer  Perl mySQL programmer with a passion for documentary
films.

The e screening room http://escreeningroom.com	on-line website dedicated
to the documentary film. Documentary film fans can watch full length
unabridged films. If they like what they see they can buy a VHS copy for
home viewing. We are awaiting non-profit status. The e screening room is
created by volunteer work.

The e screening room is dedicated to create a different distribution
channel for documentary producers. Independent documentaries are born out
of the passion –often compassion - for the subject of the documentary.
Often these documentaries are self financed.  But there is little financial
gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get
discouraged and often leave the field. We think that’s a shame: to lose
independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we
are changing that by creating a new distribution channel for documentary
film.

Most of the work on the new engine is done. We need some fine-tuning by:
1) Matching the conformation emails (Yes the buyers credit card was
charged) with the invoice number and finished the interface for the
shipping department. (20 Hr?)
2) Update the online statically reports for the number of hits and the
minutes watched, and copies sold per film. (16 HR?)
3) Create a DB output file for submitting to Amazon.com. (8 hr?)
4) Some minor GUI adjustments. (5 hr?)
 
You can see where we are at http://escreeningroom.org

Required skills:
We are looking for a volunteer with a passion for documentary films and
experience with Perl and MySQL database programming. We have a dedicated
server for the project so you can play around with the mod_perl module and
create a cool site for your resume. We can’t pay you anything but we will
mail shade-grown coffee to keep you going. 

Desired skills:
To apply send us 
1) Why you are interested in documentary films.
2) At least one link to a website that shows you skills and explain what
part you created. 
3) At least two references. 
4) Your contact info.
