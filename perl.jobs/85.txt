Job title: Win32 perl/PHP web application guru

Company name: Gibraltar Software, Inc.

Internal ID: Job2

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Pay rate: Market

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're hiring some clever people to work on a web based client/server
software product. The server and database run on Linux while the clients
are "cross platform," and are going to be initially built in Perl (for
rapid prototyping purposes) to run on Red Hat Linux, Windows 2000, and
Solaris 2.6 or later. We may later recode some of these agents in C for
speed or other reasons but we'll cross that bridge when necessary.

Competitive salary, paid time off, medical, dental benefits, etc. We may be
willing to work on a contract basis for the right person. We may be willing
to entertain telecommuting for the right person.

Recruiters/headhunters need //NOT// apply. We prefer to deal with our
candidates directly.

Yes, we are a start up with all incipient risks and potential rewards
associated therein.  No, I'm not a lawyer. I just like words such as
"incipient" and "therein."
