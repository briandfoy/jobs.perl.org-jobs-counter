Job title: HTML::Mason + Perl for web firm

Location: NY, New York, New York

Pay rate: USD 3/hr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 2 weeks to start, open thereaf

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
I seek an associate to work with me on developing tools for an content
service provider.
The emphasis is on web-side functionality. Integration with various
e-commerce systems is involved as well as extensive database integration. 
We are creating both administrative (add/update/delete and reporting)
interface to the database and end-user interface as well.

This is strictly a telecommute position. You are required to have reliable
Internet connectivity and your own development system locally from which
you will upload nightly to my system.

Productivity on a professional level is required. I offer the opportunity
to work toward a sophisticated and interesting system; the initial steps
will no doubt be rather basic but they are to establish a foundation on
which to build the ultimate multimedia content management and monetization
system.


NOTE: you *cannot* be located inside the US.
I can't afford a US employee.

I expect you to work for me at least 24 hours/week in at least 6-8 hour
intervals no more than 12 hour straight.

No equity is offered however I offer profit-sharing from this venture --
when it makes a profit.

Immediate start.
Principals only.
Payment via Evocash or E-gold or USD international postal money order. NO
paypal.

Required skills:
HTML::Mason
Perl in a Linux environment
Apache + mod_perl
Linux user / application programmer (Perl).
Class::DBI
HTML4+CSS
Javascript at a basic level
CVS or Subversion
Fluent written English in a technical context (you do not have to write the
great English-language novel, you do have to be able to communicate clearly
with me via e-mail and the occasional voice chat).
Flexible can-do attitude.

Desired skills:
ANSI SQL
MySQL
Postgresql esp. adding types
