Job title:
Senior Perl Programmer (Financial Services)

Company name: Computershare Investor Services

Internal ID: BR/GT/April 06

Location: United Kingdom, Bristol

Pay rate: £24,000 - £30,000 (GBP)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
Computershare Document Services (CDS) based in Bristol (UK)seeks a Senior
Perl Programmer to join its programming team.  The role involves writing
Perl programs to format client supplied data files for high speed laser
printing in Postscript using an in house library.  New programming projects
ranging in duration from just an hour to over a month are to be written
from scratch but the work also involves modifying existing programs for
repeat print runs.

The role requires communication with other programmers and account managers
within CDS and also within the wider Computershare business and so would
suit a programmer with more general business skills and experience.  

Required skills:
Essential:
Perl  - 2 years.
Programming (any language) - 4 years.
Strong communication skills.

The CDS business environment is fast paced and the turn over of work is
constant so this is a role for a hands on person looking for constant
challenge who also exhibits strong attention to detail.

The Senior Perl programmer is expected to work independently and to add
value to the team by recognising and acting upon opportunities for
technical improvement.	They should be able to take full ownership of
assigned work and not require supervision in order to deliver accurate work
to agreed deadlines.  The role provides scope for growth into either Team
Leader or Business Analyst based upon ability and interest.


Desired skills:
Computer Science or Programming related qualification.
Competent in CVS or Subversion.
Results orientation.
Attention to detail.
