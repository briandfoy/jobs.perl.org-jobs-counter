Job title: Fancy a few days a week in Irvine, CA?

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: Irvine, CA, United States

Pay rate: Great, with excellent benefits package

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for a fulltime Perl developer who can join us onsite a few
days a week in Irvine, and work from home the rest of the time (or fulltime
in Irvine).

You're already eligible to work in the US, and you're
interested in joining a very successful and Perl-focussed company, whose
parent company were rated one of the top 15 places to work in the US.

The
company has a number of big-data and data analysis projects, and have bet
heavily on AWS. They use a variety of Modern Perl technologies across their
projects, with codebases using Mojo, Dancer, DBIx::Class, and regularly
send developers to YAPC.

The company has maintained its small company
feel, despite being bought a few years ago by a much larger company, and
the office is super-friendly and supportive.

To recap:

* You're already
eligible to work in the US

* You can physically get to Irvine, CA a couple
of days a week

* You know Perl

Desired skills: Modern Perl
