Location: United States, NJ, Bedminster

Pay rate: flexible

Travel: 25-50%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
We're looking for a smart, flexible generalist with specific experience in
designing and working with directories (LDAP in general, replication,
schema/DIT, etc.), network authentication and web single sign-on (SSO and

knowledge of Perl for interacting with directory services and porting and
analyzing data is essential.

The work: From high-level presentation and strategy to hands-on

of the self-sufficient, patient IM expert.

Required skills:
Perl, of course.
LDAP and directory fundamentals.
Some combination of iPlanet DS, Secureway/IBM DS, openldap
Good general networking knowledge - TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP(S), DNS.
A foundation in 2000/NT4 and at least one UNIX-like operating system.
_Very_ strong writing ability in English.

Desired skills:
Metadirectory (any).
Perl CGI; Net::LDAP; Mozilla LDAP.  Perhaps ADSI.
SiteMinder, Oblix, et al.
High-availability and load-balancing solutions.
Development with Java (JNDI), C(++), and other languages would be a plus,
and/or application-server experience.
Presentation skills.
