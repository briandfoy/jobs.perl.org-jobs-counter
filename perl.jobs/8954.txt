Job title:
Lead engineer - search startup - new product

Company name: Lokku Ltd.

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: At least 2 years

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This position is really three roles in one.  We need someone to head the
technical efforts around our new product throughout its lifetime.  This can
be considered in three phases:

1. Architect.  You will work closely with a product manager to finalize
details of the product's specification.  That done, you will create a
detailed technical plan for the product's development.	This will include
choosing a technology stack, designing the system and software
architecture, and determining how to host and serve the application. This
phase is expected to take about 3 months.

2. Manager.  A important part of the planning process will include working
out the best way to scale up our engineering resources to make the
specification into a working product.  You will be required to survey the
available options and make a proposal.	We are open to a variety of
alternatives including additional full time hires in the UK, full
outsourcing, or something in between.  Once a plan is agreed upon, you will
recruit additional engineers or form relationships with suitable partners. 
We expect this phase to take about 3 months.

3. Lead Developer.  You will manage the development effort of our new
product.  This includes responsibility for meeting deadlines and day to day
management of new recruits or outsourcing partners.  You will be writing
code with one hand and managing with the other.  Main development is
expected to take no more than six months and includes a post launch
refinement period as the product settles in.

There will be some intersection among the phases and the timeline is not
written in stone.  For example, recruitment can start before the design is
complete and managerial tasks will continue during development. There will
be limited formal structure in this position, but you will not operate
completely without supervision.  Plans and decisions will be validated by
other members of the Lokku team against the sometimes conflicting goals of
low cost, ease of management, and product quality.  After the first year,
you may continue to manage the team and product maintenance and further
development or change to working on other initiatives within Lokku.  This 3
phase scheme is not a one year contract, but just the first step in a long
and productive contribution to our team.

Required skills:
The person we are looking for >must<:

* have experience managing other programmers.
* have designed a 'large' software application.
* have at least 5 years experience writing software and at least two years
experience building applications for the web using GNU/Linux or BSD,
Apache, relational databases, and Perl, Ruby, Python, or PHP.
* have a proven ability to work effectively with a minimum of structure.
* be legally allowed to work in the UK.
* be able to commit to work exclusively for Lokku for a minimum of two
years.
* be and able to work full time in Central London.
* be able to communicate in fluent English.

Desired skills:
Bonus points go to candidates that have experience with:

* managing offsite programmers.
* selecting partners for outsourcing efforts and manging relationships with
those partners.
* forming and/or managing relationships with vendors and service providers.

* managing a budget and project deadlines.
* web crawling, document indexing and classification, and efficient
searching of structured and unstructured data.
* building user interfaces for the web with AJAX.
* Unicode, UTF-8, and the general problem of efficient software
localization in the context of web applications.
* applying mathematical techniques to high-dimension optimization problems
with variable constraints.

Further bonus points if you can:

* speak additional European languages.
* are a recognized contributor to the world of free and open source
software.
