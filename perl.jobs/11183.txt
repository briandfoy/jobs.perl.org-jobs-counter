Job title: Perl/Selenium Contractor

Company name: PhotoBox Limited

Location: United Kingdom, Paddington, London

Pay rate: £300 to £350 per day

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3 months+

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Photobox is Europe's leading online personal publishing and printing
service. Based metres from Paddington station, Photobox's London office
hosts the Scrum teams responsible for development of the Photobox website. 
Following agile methodologies the teams build the
large-scale, heavy volume, customer facing website, internal admin tools,
and the API that glues it all together.  They're domain experts in what
they do, be it anything from spinning up hundreds of cloud based servers to
cope with a surge in customer demand to developing rich interactive user
experience with JavaScript.

An ideal candidate would be enthusiastic about modern Perl programming and
have a passion for HTML, CSS and all things in the browser.

**Main purpose of the contract**
To expand Photobox’s suite of automated regression tests.

As part of our continuous integration project, Photobox has already
automated some 50% of regression test cases using Selenium but the scripts
were written in Ruby and some of them are now out of date. Our core
technology is perl and it has therefore been decided to port the existing
scripts to a perl framework (based on Test::WWW::Selenium) given that we
have plenty of in-house perl expertise.

This role will involve working closely with our QA and scrum teams to
expand our frontend test cases, convert and polish the Ruby scripts and
extend test coverage to close to 100% of our manual regression test suite.

Required skills:
* Perl – at least 3 years’ experience of OO Perl, CPAN etc.
* HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript - good working knowledge
* SVN, GIT. cvs or another source code management system

Desired skills:
* Any experience with Selenium
* Basic knowledge of Ruby
* An awareness of common testing procedures and methodologies
* Basic knowledge of Hudson
* Good analytical skills
