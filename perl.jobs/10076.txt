Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Gumtree

Location: United Kingdom, London, Richmond

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Gumtree (http://www.gumtree.com/) are looking for a few experienced Perl
developers. We're looking for people with experience of using modern Perl
tools like DBIx::Class and Template Toolkit. We're also interested in
increasing our use of web frameworks and Moose so any experience you have
in those areas would be good too.

The site is built on a LAMP stack so knowledge of Linux (Debian), Apache
(and lighttpd) and MySQL would be useful.

Gumtree are based in a nice office building down by the river in Richmond
(that's zone 4). The office is about ten minutes walk from Richmond
station.

We'll consider both permies and contractors. I believe that the salaries
and rates are about average. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but
please don't let doubts about that put you off applying.

CVs to me at this address if you're interested. I'm also happy to answer
any further questions that you have.

Required skills:
Perl, DBIx::Class, Template Toolkit, Linux (Debian), MySQL

Desired skills:
Apache, lighttpd, Catalyst (or other Perl MVC framework), Java
