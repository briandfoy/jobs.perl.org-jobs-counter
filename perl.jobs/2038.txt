ceil(n + log(n)) comparisons?

who has full command of English, what a dentist does.

We're looking for some cool people to help us make the lives of healthcare
providers easier.

You're the kind of person who has always excelled at whatever it is you do,
and can pick up new skills at the drop of a hat. You find it difficult to
turn down a good challenge, and have secretly harbored dreams of either
galactic peace or galactic domination.

You love working with other excellent people, but are equally comfortable
sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper and molding reality. You know
that you can do the impossible if only you would be given a little bit more
time, but you also know you can accomplish a whole lot more if you work
with trusted colleagues.

You know the value of process. You love good process, and abhor bad
process.

You may not know a lot about healthcare now, but you know that it's badly
broken; that it's some insane percentage of our GDP and growing rapidly;
and that it's a problem that you can get passionate about.

About athenahealth-- we've been around for about 7 years now, and are
located in Waltham, MA (just outside Boston). We've been backed with $40
million in venture capital from A-list VC's-- VCs who provided some of the
original money behind Apple, Home Depot, Intel, Office Depot, Whole Foods,
etc-- but the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise
any more capital. 

We have about 330 folks working here now, and we're hiring aggressively,
but we'd rather hire the right people than hire fast. Excellence is
rewarded-- how far you go is really up to you. The working environment is
friendly and open. The folks you'll be working with are top notch, and will
probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've ever worked with
regardless of where you're coming from.

We have several open positions in hard-core next-generation web
development, QA engineering, data analysis and warehousing. The common
platform is perl/mod_perl/Oracle/Linux.

If you're interested, try to come up with a solution to at least one of the
puzzles above, or maybe more than one. Shoot that over with a resume to
puzzles@athenahealth.com, and we can start talking.


Required skills:
A keen analytical mind that can help us untangle the unholy mess that
defines how healthcare is funded. Perl is good, too, but only to the extent
that you have tried lots of languages and find perl to be one of the more
expressive languages you've tried.
