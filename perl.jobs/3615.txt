Job title:
Software Architect: Perl, PostgreSQL/MySQL, PHP, C, SOAP

Company name: SpinVox

Internal ID: dev-sa-001

Location: United Kingdom, Berkshire, Maidenhead

Pay rate: £50K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I'm looking for an experienced software architect, to lead the ongoing
design and development of our service, a large part of which is written in
Perl. This is not a design-only position, but very much hands on: I want
someone who's cares about creating robust quality software systems.

Our service converts voicemail to text, and sends it to your mobile phone,
and /or you email address. It has been running live for over a year, with
tens of thousands of users.

The system is almost entirely built from open source technologies: a large
body of Perl (SOAP services, scripts and admin tools), but also C and PHP.
The voicemail system uses Asterisk. Currently we use a mix of PostgreSQL
and MySQL, but are looking to go to a single RDBMS.

Our user base is scaling up rapidly,  so are looking for an expert level
Perl and C programmer to come in as software architect, leading the
redesign of the current system, and design for new requirements.

The work environment is relaxed and informal, with offices on the banks of
the thames (handy for radio control boat racing).

Required skills:
Perl, C, web services development (SOAP), modern web technologies including
PHP, database design and development (especially with PostgreSQL), linux,
distributed systems (load-balancing etc), high-availability scalable
network services, agile development

Desired skills:
SMS/SMPP, Asterisk, telephony (SS7, Q.931, SIP, etc)
