Job title: Perl Software Engineer

Company name: Shutterstock Images

Internal ID: Contract

Location: Virtual

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Shutterstock is a stock photo and video company, and we see ourselves at
the forefront of technology and research. We do fascinating things with
search, discovery, recommendation engines, and scalability. We're looking
for great Perl engineers to help us continue to be a leader in our
industry.  We're starting a remote development team to expand our current
team of great developers.
Remote team members can work at home, and should expect to be mostly
available during New York business hours, be comfortable with Skype video
chats, and be available for full-time work.


Required skills:
A code sample is required;

• We’d like to see something that shows your skill as a Perl programmer,
and your skills as a professional programmer.
• Your code sample should include all pieces necessary to run, including
input files • Your code sample should not depend on particular directory
names • It should be documented in the Perl style • You should have the
rights to distribute the code to us • It would be nice if it was packaged
as a CPAN-style module (though it need not be placed on CPAN). See
Module::Starter if you need help setting up a CPAN-style module

We’d especially like to see code that covers one or more of the following
topics:

• Image Manipulation
• Databases
• Batch Processing
• Something you think is relevant to high-volume websites or large amounts
of data.
• Something you think is cool in a computer-science way.

Desired skills: 
At least 5 years experience with:
* Perl
* HTML / CSS / Javascript
* MySQL
* Linux

Optional:
* HTML::Mason
* AJAX
* layout / design
* ImageMagick (and PerlMagick)
