Job title: VoIP Engineer

Company name: Gradwell dot com Ltd

Location: United Kingdom, Bath

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking to double our engineering team resources in 2011, and wish
to recruit several Voice-over-IP engineers to work on our multi-award
winning VoIP service. The majority of our VoIP platform is built from a
mixture of OpenSIPS, Asterisk, and a lot of Perl to glue it all together.

We're very interested in talking to experienced Perl developers who either
already have a VoIP background, or who are interested in taking their Perl
skills and applying them to a VoIP service.  We've opportunities both in
the provision of the actual Voice service itself, and in all of the
back-office services (provisioning, billing) that also go into making a
successful business.

This role would be especially suited to someone looking to work almost
exclusively with, and on, open-source environments.  We run Linux-based
environments all the way from the desktop through to the datacenter, and
that's just the way we like it.

The role is based in our office in Bath, but for the right candidate,
telecommuting is an option.

Required skills:
Perl
Linux-based operating systems (Debian preferred)

Desired skills:
C programming
Asterisk / OpenSIPS / FreeSwitch or equivalent
