Description:
This one is very simple. Need a Perl guru. You'll have to be one to have a
shot at this. This company will ask you to go explain to 2000 other
developers why their Perl code is not up to standards to be included in
libraries of code the company provides internal developers. You will get
them to willingly do more work! You'll teach them how to write top-notch
Perl code and make them glad they met you! This will require unusual,
extraordinary amounts of charisma.

Required skills:
Guru-level Perl skill.	Competition for this opening will be very high. 
The person who gets it will have the resources of R2 D2, the training
ability of Yoda, the manners of C3PO, and the courage of Obi-Wan.    

Desired skills:
Experience in a super-high volume transactional environment such as a major
financial institution.	The majority of the platform at this firm is
C++/Unix so that background would be a plus.
