Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Description:
Perl
Wanted Volunteer Perl, CGI PHP MYSQL programmer with a passion for
documentary films.

We are looking for a volunteer with a passion for documentary films and in
support of the freedom of speech, with experience with Perl, some MySQL /
SQL and some experience with cgi would come in handy. We are using agile
programming methods or exstreem programming.. We can’t pay you anything but
you get to help create a cool site for your resume. Expect to volunteer
about 10 hour a week consistently for this project

The non-profit e screening room http://escreeningroom.org/ is creating a
platform for documentary film makers and their audience. Documentary film
fans can watch full length unabridged films. If they like what they see
they can buy a DVD copy for home viewing. The e screening room is created
by an international group of volunteers with a passion for documentary
films. 

The e screening room is dedicated to create a different distribution
channel for documentary producers. Independent documentaries are born out
of the passion –often compassion - for the subject of the documentary.
Often these documentaries are self financed.  But there is little financial
gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get
discouraged and often leave the field. We think that’s a shame: to lose an
independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we
are changing that by creating a new distribution channel for documentary
film.

Project:
We like to expand our basic film page to include comments of the audience.
We expect someone to do research to find a module that can be integrated
with mysql and the ESR engine. This module should facilitate that Guest
should be able to create an account by an email conformation and give their
opinion about a film. Some additional features such as a point system,
other featues found in usermanagement systems would be nice. These should
also be an administrative interface manage these opinions. 

Responsibilities. 
 The responsibilities of the developer include, but are not necessary
limited to: 
 - Locating a module that includes most functionality.
 - Integrating with the ESR website.
 - Documenting the development in our wiki. 
 - Reporting weekly progress and hours worked.
 - Managing additional volunteers as needed. 

 Qualifications. 
 - Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in a bachelors program. 
 - Solid commitment put in a minimum 10 hr per week for 1 months. 
 - Fundamental project management knowledge. 
 - Strong communication, and organizational skills. 
 - Able to follow through and meet deadlines. 
 - Able to work independently

To apply send us 
1) Why you are interested in documentary films.
2) At least one link to a website that shows you skills and explain what
part you created. 
3) At least two references. 
4) Your contact info. 

This is a voluntary position, for a cool site.

If this is something you feel as passionate about as we do, please send me
a few lines about your experience to:
