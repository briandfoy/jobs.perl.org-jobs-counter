Job title: Perl - Software Development Engineer

Company name: Amazon.co.uk

Internal ID: 34834

Location: United Kingdom, Bristol 

Travel: 0-25%

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) is looking for talented Software
Engineers in the UK.
 
You're a top-notch coder.  You're experienced in enterprise systems and
SOA.   You know how to make things scale.   You're proud of your reliable,
maintainable code.  You love clarity and simplicity, but you're quick to
understand complex systems.   You love being given a
problem and rapidly coming up with a great solution.   You love writing
code!

You move fluidly between functional and object-oriented programming models,
whichever works best for the problem at hand. You automate as much as
possible. You're fundamentally a problem solver, and would rise to the
challenge of enormous data sets, increasing scale, increasing expectations
of site visitors who want their data to be fresh, relevant, accurate, and
easily updated in real time. These and a strong cup of coffee get you up on
Monday morning.
 
Join our great team of smart, passionate engineers.  Take a leading role in
designing and building IMDb's next-generation data management systems, and
be part of the biggest, best, most award-winning movie and TV site on the
planet.  You'd be joining a growing, cutting-edge 
company with a proven business model and excellent prospects.

Our UK team work entirely from home on equipment and broadband provided by
IMDb, but you'd need to be able to attend a weekly pub lunch and other
meetings with the rest of the team in Bristol.	Our salaries are extremely
competitive, and we offer a top-notch benefits package courtesy of our
parent company, Amazon.com.


Required skills:
* Computer Science degree or equivalent (Masters preferred), along with
relevant industry programming experience.
* Experience in designing/developing enterprise systems, and working with
databases and Web Services.
* Evidence of excellent API design and architecture skills and an
understanding of best-practises.
* Proficient at OO programming/design.
* Proficient working and scripting in a UNIX/Linux environment 
* Fluent English, solid communication skills and the ability to work well
in a team are critical.

Preferred:
* Our primary development environment is Perl, but Perl experience isn't a
requirement if you're an exceptional candidate and keen to learn.  If
you're not fluent in OO Perl, you'll need to demonstrate related skills and
evidence of adaptability.  Experience in multiple languages would count in
your favour.
* Relevant advanced competencies like Expert Systems, data
warehousing/mining, distributed systems, natural language processing would
be a big plus.
* Experience of common Perl APIs/frameworks like Test::More, Log4perl,
Moose, Mason, etc would count in your favour.
