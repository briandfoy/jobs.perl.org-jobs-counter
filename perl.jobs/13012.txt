Job title: Web Developer

Company name: mySociety

Location: Anywhere in the UK

Pay rate: £35-47k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Do you enjoy working in any of	Ruby, Python, Perl or Javascript? Are you
looking for smart colleagues, meaningful projects, and fresh technology
challenges? Do you want to work from a place that suits you - and not be
forced to commute to the middle of London? mySociety is a community of
coders and technology fiends using our talents to make the world a better
place.

We do this by building useful, high impact, democratic open source web apps
like FixMyStreet.com, WhatDoTheyKnow.com and TheyWorkForYou.com, and
running projects, such as Alaveteli, to help people run tools like these
around the world.

We’re hiring open-source-savvy web developers in order to grow our
international impact, help us sustain ourselves through commercial work,
and increase our reach in the UK.

Required skills:
A broad range of front and back end experience in open source languages.
You should be able to take a project from design to execution, covering
everything in between. Our current main projects are in PHP, Python, Ruby,
Perl and node.js.

Experience in working with open source databases (such as PostgreSQL,
MySQL, MongoDB).

You should have autonomously conceived, designed and built at least one
interactive website or app of some kind, running it for extended periods.

It would also help if you have maintained open source tools that are
re-used by others.

The ability to write clean, maintainable front end HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.

A pragmatic approach to automated testing.
