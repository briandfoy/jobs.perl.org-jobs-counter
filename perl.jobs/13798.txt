Job title: Lead Web Performance Engineer

Company name: Binary.com

Location: Malaysia

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Founded in 1999, Regent Markets Group has become the recognized leader in
the binary options industry. The Group has over 300,000 clients worldwide
and generates annual betting turnover expected to exceed US$ 500 million
this year. The company's award winning website, Binary.com (formerly known
as Betonmarkets.com) offers its clients a broad range of binary options on
international stock indices, foreign exchange rates, equities, and
commodities, ranging in duration from minutes up to one year. The website
is unique in its ability to offer investors, speculators, traders, and
gamblers the ability to price and purchase customized market risk.

Due to continued expansion, Binary.com is recruiting for a Lead Web
Performance Engineer.

The role's primary goal will be to optimize binary.comâ€™s website and
systems for speed and scalability. As a high-traffic website serving
international clients who trade 24 hours a day, the speed of the website
and transactional systems are crucial to the client experience, most
notably in a fast-moving financial markets environment. Accordingly each
layer of our technology stack requires optimization for maximum
performance. As the company's systems are written entirely in Perl,
significant Perl expertise is required.

As a Lead Engineer, you may also manage a team of 2-3 junior engineers whom
you will be expected to lead and mentor.

Required skills:
* Strong experience with Perl, notably with complex code and profiling.
* Strong experience with front-end optimization and profiling.
* A passion for optimization, performance, scalability, reliability and
great attention to detail.

Desired skills: * Management/team-lead experience would be a plus.
