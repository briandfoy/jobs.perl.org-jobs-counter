Inspire, the largest social network for patients and
caregivers, is hiring collaborative, curious, forward-looking developers to
enhance and modernize our approach to... everything!  The products we
develop help people in very tangible ways.
 
Inspire’s technology stack is
primarily Linux, MySQL, Apache2+mod_perl and Template::Toolkit, along with
lots of other fiddly bits you’d expect to see in a web development shop. 
We use a wide variety of technologies, and are constantly looking to
improve our systems and our members’ experience.
  
WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING
Support, maintain and extend systems to support clients, designers and
stakeholders. Produce updates, improvements and documentation on a wide
variety of systems.
We are a multi-language shop that strives to use the
right tools for the job at hand. We are currently using Perl. As we
continue to modernize and scale our architecture we are considering the
deployment of Go, node.js, Erlang, and more to ensure we are using the
right tools and best practices available. We are not looking for a
jack-of-all-trades to work in every language under the sun, but we're also
not looking to only work in a single stack.
Working in a very supportive
and collaborative team environment that values your ideas, opinions,
curiosity, and creativity
Interacting with stakeholders, designers, other
developers and system admins
Evaluating new technologies and helping to
modernize our technical infrastructure
Full lifecycle development
Developing new features
Ongoing maintenance

Desired skills:
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Proficiency in Perl web development or Python, PHP,
or Ruby
Experience with scripting languages (eg: BASH, Perl, Ruby)
Understanding of the traditional LAMP hosting stack
A good understanding of
MySQL
Solid Linux experience (eg: Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS) with a focus on web
(Apache/Nginx)
Understanding of protocols/technologies like SOA, HTTP, SSL,
LDAP, JDBC, Servlet/JSP, SQL, HTML, XML.
Very strong troubleshooting skills
Strong technical curiosity
