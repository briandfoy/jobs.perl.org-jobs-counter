Senior Content Management Software Engineer

Location: NY, New York

Pay rate: 80-85k

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our client is pursuing an aggressive Internet-expansion strategy and is
seeking a seasoned software engineer with strong Perl skills to join its
online-media team. The engineer will be developing and extending internal
content-management systems, with responsibilities ranging from working with
business leaders to define requirements to managing the launch process and
many tasks in between. This is a challenging position requiring in-depth

We have a very sharp, passionate, and fast-moving development team that

not be happy here; people who thrive on learning new technologies, defining
their jobs, having a direct contribution to the success of the business,
and thinking entrepreneurially will do well. 

Overall responsibilities 

Designing and developing new applications or enhancements to our
open-source content-management system (Krang) or blogging system (Movable

Helping to refine the technical architecture of the site 
Investigating new Web technologies and determining their role in the
business 
Working with product-management team to identify promising new technologies
and developing proofs-of-concept 
Serving as development lead on projects involving contract development
teams 
Refining business requirements for new site features and working with
editorial team to enhance site usability 
Qualifications: This is a hands-on development position 

Required skills:
requiring the following:

Expert-level proficiency in object-oriented Perl (minimum 5 years
experience) 
Expert-level proficiency in JavaScript, with heavy experience in
object-oriented JavaScript development 
Expert-level proficiency developing mod_perl compliant applications, with
extensive experience porting CGI applications to mod_perl preferred. 
Working knowledge with CGI::Application, Catalyst, or other MVC Perl
development framework 
Active working knowledge of AJAX 
Experience with Python a strong plus
