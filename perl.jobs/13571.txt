Job title: Strong DevOps with Perl Experience

Company name: All Around The World

Location: Hanover, Germany

Pay rate: competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is Ovid and I'm looking for a strong DevOps for a company in Hanover,
GermanyA work permit/Blue Card plus excellent relocation package is
available for the right candidate.

The company is stable, profitable and they've been around for over a
decade. Hanover is a beautiful, bike-friendly, mid-sized town in the north
of Germany. The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high. It's
a green-friendly town and hosts one of the largest Oktoberfests in the
world.

As a DevOps, not only will you be responsible for keeping their systems up
and running, you’ll also have the ability to shape the operations
management product all your colleagues are using. You will be there working
with the dev team to help them build the right ops management system.

You have been working as a Systems Administrator, Network Engineer or
Software Developer for a few years and you’re looking to move up.  One of
your first tasks will likely be to develop a stable, reliable continuous
deployment environment for the company.

Required skills:
- You're comfortable coding Perl
- You could pass for a sysadmin (Linux) 
- You are passionate about solving problems.
- You have a record of consistently learning new technologies and
implementing them effectively.
- You have opinions about how to engineer solutions and you’re happy to
share them in a team environment.
- You’ve got experience solving engineering problems. Now you want to dive
deep and solve real structural, fundamental operations issues.
- You know that great DevOps engineers are just as comfortable writing code
as they are provisioning hardware. You share the company philosophy that
operations engineering is about writing software to manage machines.
- You know that DevOps is also more than just software deployment or
provisioning servers - it’s a new way of thinking about cooperation and
coordination between the people who make the software and the people who
run it.
- You understand and apply Agile principles.

Desired skills:
Speaking German's a plus, but not mandatory (the company will help you with
German lessons). 
- Appreciating great German beer is nice. 
- You don't drool on your t-shirt
