Job title: Perl CGI developer (lx-office-erp)

Company name: Stardawn Consulting

Internal ID: lxoffice

Location: Germany, Thuringia, Erfurt

Pay rate: 300 EUR

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need to outsource some of my work.

The subject is Lx-office, an accounting application based on Perl and
PostgreSQL.

The next task in line (and the subject of this job posting) is adding
dynamic support for multiple locales/languages. Currently the
locale/language of the system is set in a configuration file. The goal is
making it possible to switch the locale/language on a per-user basis at
runtime. Additionally a link needs to be offered in each document (or the
menu frame) to switch the language.

The budget for this is 300 EUR (~384 USD at current xch rates) and there’s
more lxoffice-related work in line.

Please name a price that is really acceptable to you (it needs to be below
the budget line, though). More details are available if you need them. I
will not choose the cheapest partner but the one that seems most apt to do
the job.

I can give some guidance on setting up Lx-office, on generating the diff
and on possible ways to solve the problem.


=== General conditions ===

Payment will be delivered via Moneybookers, Paypal or whatever suits you
best.

Due to time constraints I’m only going to reply to applications that seem
promising and fitting; I’m sure you’re all going to understand this. :)

Required skills:
 * The applicant must know enough about Perl and CGI to understand the
relevant portions of the system.

 * They also need to be able to set up the software on their own machine;
they therefore need a GNU/Linux system (or possibly MacOS X) and some
proficiency with it.

 * The work is to be delivered as a git-style unified diff at the end. You
will be working with a Mercurial repository (you don't need to be
proficient with it).

 * Patience and persistence are crucial to be successful at this task.


Desired skills:
Experience in finding your way around in a large system.
