Job title:
short-term contract: perl-driven selenium harness for javascript library

Company name: Vivox, Inc.

Location: United States, MA, Natick

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Description:
We need a test harness framework for our javascript library. We can use
Selenium's perl driver, but we need that basic web page framework that
allows us:

1) to make javascript calls directly (Selenium's get_eval())
2) a framework webpage that instantiates our web plugin and allows Selenium
to make javascript calls
3) a history mechanism that pulls out events that the plugin receives
(another javascript call on the web end and a perl history structure)
4) example code for making calls and getting events back from the plugin

Currently, in-house we have an open job position where this is the first
target project, but since people have probably done this before, I would
love to buy an existing harness from someone who's made one.

A detailed RFP will be sent to interested parties.
