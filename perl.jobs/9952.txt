web-services and web-based admin tools

discussions
•	Participating in generating ideas for product and process

•	Contributing to the team's drive for operational excellence -
reducing the support burden for applications through careful use of metrics
and monitoring.
 
We're a highly-motivated, co-operative, agile team who thrive on solving
challenging problems with innovation.	 The team is mainly located in

office.   Our UK staff work from home but meet frequently for face-to-face
meetings in the Bristol area.
