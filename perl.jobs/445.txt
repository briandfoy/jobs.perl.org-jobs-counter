Job title:
perl/mod_perl/mysql/linux programmer required!

Company name: Electronic Group

Location: Spain, Barcelona

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
We need a programmer who knows perl and mod_perl, mysql (or postgresql) and
linux.. php could be useful also but perl is more needed.
We have many web apps that need updating, many more that are waiting to be
developed.. our system handles huge amounts of traffic (millions or hits
per day) and so we develop systems that can handle it!

The job can be done either in our office in barcelona or remotely - we are
more interested in results rather than hours on a timesheet!



Required skills:
You must work fast, on your own initiative - we don't have baby sitters! ;)


You must work secure! Good secure programming is a must - we don't wanna
make life easy for the hackers!
