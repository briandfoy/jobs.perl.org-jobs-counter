Job title: Full Stack Developer (perl)

Company name: Inphoria

Location: Chicago

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are seeking a mature developer capable of operating at all levels of the
web application stack to participate in refactoring and new development of
a medium-large application and its infrastructure.

---

Our project is a
small no-BS modern web stack application for a boutique law firm home to
young lawyers hungry to integrate technology throughout the business.

This
application is something no one has done it before, and it solves a number
of novel problems in an interesting business domain.

Some basic tech stack
information:

All back end hosts run linux. Current developers are using
Macos but you can use whatever is most productive for you on your developer
machine.
=20
The application router is Mojolicious on perl 5.24 (currently).
The router, other daemons and services heavily leverage a group of perl
libraries built around Moose. The perl practices derive from modern perl
design patterns and language standards.
=20
The front end is primarily jquery
with a few custom modules, jqueryUI, and then a smattering of third party
plugins, the two largest of which in footprint are dataTables and ag-Grid.


The data stores are SQL based at this time though certain schema-less or
noSQL tools are under consideration. Libraries can provide a Store model
for anything which can be returned as an object/hash: API calls, files, web
pages, shell output, etc.
=20
The application involves a large footprint of
Automated User Agents for various external data source scraping tools.
There are also regularly run ETL processes which are fed from certain
government data sources.

There are some other small components built in
Golang and Python.
=20
In my opinion, its pretty darn cool but it has grown
too large for one hacker to manage.

In terms of what it does:
Information
glue interfaces which marry disparate and eclectic resources into user
friendly UIs for rendering on desktop, laptop, and mobile form factors
Comprehensive case management and status tracking
Abstraction and
integration of local filesystems through the browser
Extensive document
generation both in singleton, groups, and batch of groups including
publishing automation
Note management, notifications, task assignment and
communication support
Extensive support for scraping external sources and
hoarding data
A whole bunch more ...

What we can offer:
Interesting
technology and interesting problems to work on in a well-controlled
technical environment with minimal management interference as well as
abstraction from annoying actors
A solid design and solid answers available
when you need them from technical managers
Environment encouraging no-BS
technical solutions
An opportunity to make design decisions with big impact
on software that will be running for decades
Generous levels of
compensation and support
Brand new hardware set with VPN credentials for
remote access
Once up to speed, maximal flexibility with work hours and
locations

Desired skills:
perl, mysql, mojolicious, moose, javascript, jquery, jquery-ui, data
tables, ag-grid, python, golang, linux, bash
