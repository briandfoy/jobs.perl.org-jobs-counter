Job title:
Skilled OO Perl developer for content management systems

Company name: McClatchy Interactive

Internal ID: MSCTO1

Location: United States, NC, Raleigh

Pay rate: US $60-85K

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
McClatchy Interactive (MI) develops and hosts software to power the online
presence of the McClatchy Newspaper Company, which owns, among others, The
Miami Herald, The Sacramento Bee, and the Fort Worth Star Telegram. 

MI is located in Raleigh, NC, and San Jose, CA. MI produces an enterprise
content management system, an online classified advertisement platform, a
registration system to provide users with customized online features, and
an events calendar to organize restaurants, events, and venues. 

The bulk of software MI develops is written in Perl and is based on the
LAMP stack. Open source tools and commodity hardware are used whenever
possible. The classified ads system is written is J2EE. Other components
are developed in PHP. 

At this time, MI is searching for a senior Perl developer to help create
the next generation of newspaper print/online software. The developer will
cooperate with other senior staff to design and develop the new system and
to migrate existing infrastructure over time to the new model. This is a
hands-on coding role with additional responsibility for designing
subsystems and directing other Perl coders. 

Ideally, you would live in the Raleigh area and be able to work onsite to
interact with staff. An exception can be considered depending on your
experience, skills, and ability to engage others. The pay scale for this
position is $60-85K, depending on experience. It's a full-time gig, with
benefits. 


Required skills:
Brownie points are awarded if you've developed and deployed large-scale OO
Perl applications, mod_perl, are familiar with REST, modern-day ORM
libraries, and the latest widgets in the CPAN. Development will be fast,
iterative, and dynamic. 

Desired skills:
Gold stars are awarded for experience with SOA-like architectures, a wicked
sense of humor, a collection of toys, or if you've ever been abducted by
aliens.
