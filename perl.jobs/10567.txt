Job title: Freelance Catalyst Developer

Location:
United Kingdom, Cambridgeshire, Cambridge

Pay rate: GBP30/HR

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a client that needs a new freelancer (as I am unable to continue
doing freelance) do support their Catalyst based web sites. It's not
regular work (as in it comes in ad hoc), but the rates are  good and the
work they want is pretty straightforward. The two sites, although built on
Catalyst, are built very differently (by me).


They are hosted on a dedicated Debian server hosted by Bytemark.
Technologies used include Catalyst, jQuery, MySQL, DBI and Lighttpd. They
currently have an urgent need to get a Shibboleth based authentication
system up and running on one of the sites.


Required skills:
Perl
Catalyst
DBI
MySQL
Lighttpd

Desired skills: Shibboleth experience
