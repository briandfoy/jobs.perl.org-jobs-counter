Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: CarDomain Network, Inc.

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: DOE - US

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Are you a software engineer that’s looking to…

•	Code in a field and on an application which is extremely relevant? 

•	Work in an environment where software engineers are not just
cubicle coders but full participants in shaping the product and the
business? 
•	Be involved in all phases of the product lifecycle from
requirements to release and maintenance? 
•	Make a significant impact on the business by doing your daily job
(and more!)? 
•	Interact with a group of like-minded engineers who are passionate
about software, software systems, and technology in general? 

CarDomain Network, Inc. is a privately held company in the social media
space and is looking for full-time software engineers.	We’ve been around
since 1998 and have been developing social networking applications before
MySpace, Facebook or Friendster.  The development team takes their job of
creating functional, maintainable, sustainable and releasable code very
seriously and is involved in all aspects of application development in our
time-to-market driven environment.  However, we are also a laid-back group
that enjoys playing chess and hanging out at our free Friday lunches (yes,
every Friday!).  Do you meet the following requirements?

•	Significant experience working with large-scale MVC web
applications with high-traffic demands 
•	You’re a good communicator that’s most-comfortable when working on
cross-functional teams 
•	You’re also bullish on code quality and maintainability, but able
to balance that with the pragmatism necessary to release product in a
timely fashion 
•	Former managers describe you as an extremely productive contributor
with a get-it-done attitude 

If so, please submit your resume as well as solutions to the following
problems:

1.	You are given a C-array of indeterminate length containing
unbounded integers where each integer is repeated exactly once.  An integer
that does not already exist in the array is added randomly to the array. 
Write an algorithm (pseudo-code is fine, extra points for actual code in
any language) to find the non-repeated integer in the most efficient manner
(big-O space+time). 
a.	Ex. Array contains (4, 5, -1, 5, 16, 4, -1).  Your algorithm should
return 16. 
2.	You are given a C-array of indeterminate length containing
unbounded integers where each integer exists in the array only once.  An
integer that does not already exist in the array is added twice to random
positions in the array.  Write an algorithm (pseudo-code is fine, extra
points for actual code in any language) to find the repeated integer in the
most efficient manner (big-O space+time). 
a.	Ex. Array contains (-8, 10, 156, 10, -13, 4).  Your algorithm
should return 10. 


Required skills:
Qualifications
•	Thorough understanding of object-oriented methodology 
•	Thorough understanding of MVC architectures 
•	Experience with coding database-backed web applications 
•	Expert knowledge in mod_perl 
•	Intermediate knowledge of a mod_perl templating language 
•	Intermediate CSS and Javascript skills 
•	Willingness to work in an Agile development environment 
•	Ability to clearly and concisely communicate technical ideas
