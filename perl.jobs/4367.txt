Job title:
Senior Perl developer, Catalyst/DBIx::Class/TT (AJAX desired)

Company name: Wotan

Location: United States, CT, Fairfield

Pay rate: Rate is negotiable and paid in USD.

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: At least 6 months; indefinite

Hours: Flexible

Description:
Wanted:  One brilliant Perl programmer and one brilliant DBA.  Ideally they
would be the same person. On this list, I'm only asking for the Perl
person.

Why:  I'm running a startup with funding.  We're building a project
management webapp using  AJAX, Catalyst, and DBIx::Class.  I am looking for
top people (*not* "Human Resources"), and I will pay them like top people. 
I've got a great team already, and I just need one or two more people to
round it out.  

Nota Bene:  if $applicant->has_a($dayjob) then before I can hire you,
$dayjob will have to sign an IP release saying that they know you're doing
consulting, they're ok with it, and they don't own the work you do for me.


Required skills:
Perl
Catalyst
DBIx::Class
Template Toolkit

Desired skills:
AJAX
DB administration
System administration
