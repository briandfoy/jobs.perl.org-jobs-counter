Job title: Documenting an existing Perl script

Company name: Precision Translation Tools

Location: Bangkok, Thailand

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
Document an existing LGPL3 Perl script. The script is a workflow with 89
command-line arguments and nine independent stages. Each stage concatenates
the command argument values into input/output file paths and arguments that
are use to run binary application or script sub-processes. The "real" work
is done by the subprocess. This script is not complicated; it's just a lot
of boring work.

The script is virtually undocumented in the project where it's published.
"Document everything" includes which stages use what arguments, how they
are used, and what is the affect on the input/output path names for each of
the stages. We will this documentation under Creative Commons license and
contribute it back to the original open source project. Project fee
negotiable.

Required skills: Perl
