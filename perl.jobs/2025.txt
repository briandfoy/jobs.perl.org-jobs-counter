Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: P2

Location: United States, CA, Mission Viejo

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys for a variety of
clients in the market research industry. We offer both software licensing
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we program surveys
using our own software on a project-by-project basis for clients who would
rather outsource all survey set up.

Our core software is built using Perl, mod_perl, DBI, and Apache running on
Linux servers. We are hiring a software engineer to help us expand and
improve on our core software and to support our current clients.

The software engineer will learn our overall system architecture as quickly
as possible and then help us continually expand and improve our systems by
writing modular, clean code.  In addition the software engineer will
provide support to clients by responding to email requests and assisting
with client projects from time to time, particularly on more difficult
custom jobs.


Required skills:
Object-oriented Perl, mod_perl, DBI and PostgreSQL are the primary skills
the employee will be using day to day. However the ability to learn quickly
and adapt is more important than any particular technical skill.  In
addition, since the software engineer will be providing client support,
good personal skills and a professional manner with clients is essential.

Desired skills:
Other desired skills:
    - The ability to set up hardware (for example, installing all necessary
software on a new Linux server) and some level of networking expertise.
    - The ability to understand our business and suggest ways to leverage
our current technology.
    - The ability to work independently
 
Finally, because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked
to wear different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to
help the company grow and prosper.
