Job title: Web Developer – Perl | Python | Ruby + JavaScript

Company name: Lokku

Location: Clerkenwell, London, UK

Pay rate: £25,000 - £35,000 (dependent on experience)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Lokku is seeking an intelligent, motivated and forward thinking Web
Developer to work on the front end of our primary product, the Nestoria
property search engine, and to help us continue serving millions of house
hunters in eight countries and six languages.

The challenges we face at Lokku are similar to those faced by larger search
engines such as Google. On the one hand we have a very popular website that
needs to remain be lightning fast and deliver a fantastic search
experience. On the other hand we have a huge amount of data that we need to
analyse, clean up, extract keywords from, geocode and de-duplicate.

As a member of the development team your primary focus will be our
user-facing systems, which encompasses our highly customized search
backend, our templates and HTML generation code, up to and including the
client-side JavaScript that gives Nestoria its unique user experience.
However you will not be restricted to any one part of the code base; we
expect our development team to pitch in on every system and to work
together to make Nestoria the best it can be.

More about Lokku:

Lokku is a small web company based in Clerkenwell, central London. Our
primary brand, Nestoria is a vertical search engine in the real estate
market.

We like to give something back to the technology communities we're involved
in, and are especially keen on contributing to the Perl (CPAN) and
Geo-spatial open source development communities. We make our API available
to developers, are frequent sponsors of relevant events and operate Geomob
London, a quarterly meet-up for geo and mobile enthusiasts.

We also like to give back to our team members. We invest time into
expanding our collective knowledge through attending conferences and
training days, and through our own internal tech talk where each week one
engineer presents to the team about any subject. Each developer in the team
has a training budget allocated to them and is expected to search out and
suggest training opportunities.

Required skills:
Maybe you are looking to make the move to a tech team which embraces the
principles of clean code, best practice development methodologies, and
user-centred product planning. Perhaps you crave a role in a smaller,
tightly-knit team which affords you a higher degree of responsibility and a
more diverse range of juicy projects to work on. Or maybe you can't wait to
get your hands on our frontend and make it work even more smoothly on Opera
on Android on your Nexus 7.

We are relaxed about your personal motivations, as long as you have the
following:

•Experience with Perl…
•     … or with other scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, or PHP
•Experience with web development including JavaScript and jQuery
•Experience developing on a Linux platform
•Excellent technical communication skills
•A pragmatic and practical approach to solving problems

Desired skills:
It is also desirable but not essential that you have some of the following:


•Experience with internationalization and character encoding
•Good understanding of test-driven development
•Time spent using version control systems in a team environment
•Experience with writing systems which have to scale to large numbers of
users, database rows, etc.
•Ability to write and maintain C code
