Description:
I am looking for another software developer for the LIMS group at The
Genome Institute, a position where the primary language is Perl.  You may
contact me directly (my user name at genome.wustl.edu) with your resume and
samples of code or hosted repositories; it does not matter to me what
languages you choose.  Officially, you can apply to this job through
https://jobs.wustl.edu (search for job ID 28449).  Below is a copy of the

considered a mid-tier position, between junior and senior experience.


ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS

The Genome Institute at Washington University has an opening for a talented
software engineer in the Bioinformatics group.	The position will work with
an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting
the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large
scale genomic research projects.  The Genome Institute has been at the
forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a
part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes
and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects.  The Genome Institute is a
world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and
uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and
provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human
diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease).  In addition, the
Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various
educational and outreach efforts.


DEPARTMENT SUMMARY

One of only three NIH-funded large-scale genome centers in the United
States, The Genome Institute at Washington University is a leader in
genomics research as it applies to the study of biology, human disease and
the field of personalized medicine. Founded in 1993, The Genome Institute
focuses on cancer genomics, the genomics of heritable diseases, microbial
and pathogen genomics, as well as novel sequencing and evolutionary
genomics. 

Our mission is to help improve the human condition by producing, studying,
and interpreting high-quality genome-based data that drives biological
discoveries that range from the bench to the hospital bedside. We value the
open sharing of information and ideas and encourage collaboration while
also engaging the next generation of scientists through educational
outreach efforts.

EOE STATEMENT

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without
regard to sex, race, ethnicity, protected veteran, or disability status.

Required skills:
Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or
college plus two years of relevant work experience required. Additional
relevant programming experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis
for required education

Desired skills:
The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is
interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production
environment.  The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a
regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers
across groups.	The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get
things done will find a lot of opportunity.  Design, testing, debugging,
and problem analysis are a regular part of the work.  Skills in abstract
software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling,
and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require
thorough knowledge of each concept.  The applicant will use these skills to
develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory
equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and
provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the
laboratory managers and technicians.  Proficiency in dynamically typed
languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. 
Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful.	Experience
with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as
REST and AJAX is an asset.  Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and
other UNIX-like development environments.  Familiarity with open source
technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a
network environment are also assets.
