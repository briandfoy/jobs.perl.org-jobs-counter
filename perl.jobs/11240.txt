Job title: Build Engineer

Company name: Riverbed Technology

Internal ID: 2540

Location: United States, CA , San Francisco or Sunnyvale 

Length of employment: Full Time 

Hours: Full time

Description:
Like analyzing and breaking complex systems?
Excited by virtualization and networking?
Ready to work on something big?

We’ve got the job for you.

You’ll be working on serious software that over 75 of the 100 biggest
global companies put in the core of their networks.  You’ll be surrounded
by experts in the field, but be empowered to forge your own path.  You’ll
have the right tools – from a hands-off, fully-automated lab with a few
thousand machines at your disposal, to a test code library built so that
you concentrate on your test logic, not the trivial stuff.  We understand
that you need just enough of the right processes, so you’ll take part in
code reviews and use proven documentation and progress tracking standards
that help us build and test rock-solid products.  And most importantly,
you’ll have new challenges at every turn.
We’re a fun group that feels more “Web 2.0” than “Big Company.” You can run
Mac OS, Windows, or Linux with double monitors and your favorite ergo
keyboard – we don’t care, as long as it fits your style.
