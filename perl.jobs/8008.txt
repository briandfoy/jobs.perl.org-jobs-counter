• Strong written and spoken English
• Ability to learn quickly
• Excellent team player

We encourage applicants from all countries in our service region to apply.

Desired skills:
• Experience in database performance tuning and clustering, particularly
MySQL
• Experience working in agile development environments (XP/Scrum)
• Experience with source code control systems (SVN/SVK preferred)
• Experience and understanding of designing and implementing clustered,
high performance (server) systems
• Affinity with the Open Source community, preferably through demonstrated
contributions
