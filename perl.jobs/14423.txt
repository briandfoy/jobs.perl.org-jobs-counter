Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: MissionStaff

Location: San Francisco, California

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Long Term Consulting Role

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Typically I focus on roles local to the Philadelphia area but in this case,
our client has offices nationally.  The hiring manager and rest of the team
is located in Delaware, but as the business is in California heâ€™d like to
start building a team in the San Fran office. The work would focus on an
application that is for taking payments from a device (like Square) that
you plug into a phone and use a credit card.  The application is written in
Perl.  

My Notes

Client is seeking someone who is a Perl Developer, who will be building out
the front end of a web based application.  Candidate should have active
perl experience (although would consider someone with Java who has perl
experience).  Backend is written in MySQL.   Nice to have skills are
Jenkins/restful.  They interviewed 3 people so far and they were not right
because they were more systems admins just developing perl scripts and this
is a front end developer.

Required skills:
This person will be responsible for the definition, design, construction,
integration, testing, and support of reliable and reusable software
solutions, addressing business opportunities. Includes systems analysis,
creation of specifications, coding, testing, and implementation of
application programs and data interfaces. 

Requires a previous domain of experience in applications development.
Responsible for overall application design, including interfaces with other
applications and systems. Assures that application designs are consistent
with industry best practices application attributes (including scalability,
availability, maintainability, and flexibility). 

Technologies used will be Perl, Perl Dancer, Jenkins, Json, MySQL

Desired skills:
Prior application development experience 
Demonstrated experience with large scale application integration efforts 
Communication - Ability to communicate strategies and processes around data
modeling and architecture to cross functional groups and senior levels 
Ability to influence multiple levels on highly technical issues and
challenges 
Demonstrated experience to influence and coordinate third parties and
suppliers
