I'm looking for a job involving Perl. I'm looking for something that will
challenge me and will evolve over time; a job that can only be done by
someone good, rather than a job that could be done equally well by a team of
juniors.

I have a proven track record of shipping stable software; you're probably
running a version of Perl that I released. As well as Perl, C and everything
in between, I'm more than competent with C++ and SQL, I have broad experience
of many other technologies, and I pick things up quickly. I'm looking for
something that exploits my existing expertise, but also gives the opportunity
to learn new skills and languages.

Another quality that sets me apart is that I can solve inherently complex
problems. Most people can solve larger problems by reducing them to a set of
smaller problems, and solving each in turn, but where divide-and-conquer
doesn't work, they are stuck. I can visualise these problems at all levels
simultaneously and find solutions where others fail.

My CV is at http://www.ccl4.org/~nick/CV.html
