Description:
Senior Software Engineer (Perl Backend Developer)
Location: Arlington, VA
 
Inspire, the largest social network for patients and caregivers, is hiring
collaborative, curious, forward-looking developers to enhance and modernize
our approach to... everything!	The products we develop help people in very
tangible ways.
 
Inspire’s technology stack is primarily Linux, MySQL,
Apache2+mod_perl and Template::Toolkit, along with lots of other fiddly
bits you’d expect to see in a web development shop.  We use a wide variety
of technologies, and are constantly looking to improve our systems and our
members’ experience.
  
WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING
Design and build Inspire's
next generation products, including application and API layers, on Linux,
AWS and with various third party integrations.
We are a multi-language shop
that strives to use the right tools for the job at hand. We are currently
using Perl. As we continue to modernize and scale our architecture we are
considering the deployment of Go, node.js, Erlang, and more to ensure we
are using the right tools and best practices available. We are not looking
for a jack-of-all-trades to work in every language under the sun, but we're
also not looking to only work in a single stack.
Working in a very
supportive and collaborative team environment that values your ideas,
opinions, curiosity, and creativity
Interacting with stakeholders,
designers, other developers and system admins
Evaluating new technologies
and helping to modernize our technical infrastructure
Full lifecycle
development
Full stack development (LAMP)
Developing new features
Ongoing
maintenance

Desired skills:
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Proficiency in Perl web development
Experience with
scripting languages (eg: BASH, Perl, Ruby) and automation tools (e.g.
Ansible, Puppet, Chef, cfengine)
Understanding of the traditional LAMP
hosting stack
A good understanding of MySQL
Solid Linux experience (eg:
Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS) with a focus on web (Apache/Nginx)
Understanding of
protocols/technologies like SOA, HTTP, SSL, LDAP, JDBC, Servlet/JSP, SQL,
HTML, XML.
Very strong troubleshooting skills
Strong technical curiosity
