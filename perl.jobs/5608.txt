Job title:
Object oriented Perl consultant for hedge fund

Company name: OZ Capital

Internal ID: risk consultant

Location: 10019, NY, New York

Pay rate: tba

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3-6 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
We are a large financial firm, using Object Oriented Perl to develop
quantitative applications for risk management and trading.  We periodically
need extra hands for the more data-centric projects.

We'd like a consultant to work on a per-project basis, possibly as a
telecommuter.

The initial project is to create a module for efficiently retrieving
timeseries data from multiple data sources.
The module will be extensible (to accomodate new data sources) and will
hide the multiplicity of sources from the caller.
Environment is Cygwin (runs on top of Windows) so a UNIX/LINUX background
is preferable to a Windows background.

Required skills:
Solid Object Oriented design/programming; SQL knowledge and experience with
DBI.

This is NOT a Web-application or a "scripting" job -- we use Perl as a true
object-oriented language.

Desired skills:
Familiarity with Inline and PDL would be useful.  Agile programming or
rapid development experience helpful.
Experience in finance a plus.
