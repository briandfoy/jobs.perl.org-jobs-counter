Description:
We are looking for a highly motivated Perl developer skilled in writing

our small company.

Our main source of work is database (mySQL) driven websites developed using
Perl on a Linux hosting environment. We also spend a fair amount of time

might be made of modifications to several existing websites, or help
developing new projects from the start. 

We expect the candidate to be available for at least 3 hours of dedicated
development work per day, with visible results and a good work log of
progress.

When applying please supply sample code, resume, expected hourly rate, and
list any relevant experience in a similar development situation.

Fundamental understanding of OO design and development is essential. Must
be productive and highly capable of working independently while documenting
progress daily.

Desired skills:
Linux system administration.
Apache webserver configuration.
XP development methodology.
