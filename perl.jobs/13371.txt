Job title:
Senior QA Engineer at a small, profitable web services company
(telecommute)

Company name: MaxMind, Inc.

Pay rate: $100-140k annually

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for a tester/developer to help us
ensure the quality of our releases. MaxMind offers web services and
downloadable databases focused on IP intelligence and fraud detection. We
are planning new projects as well as improvements to our existing services.


Your job will be to work with developers and product management to test
changes to existing products, as well as test new products to ensure they
behave as expected. You will also liaise with our support team so that you
are aware of problems being reported by users. You will work with
developers to triage these bug reports and make sure they are fixed in
future releases.

Things that need testing at MaxMind include our website, our web services,
our downloadable databases, client APIs, and more. Your job is to break
them all and then help us rebuild them.

We're looking for a detail-oriented person with strong development and
communication skills. Whenever possible, we expect you to automate tests
using tools like Selenium, Jenkins, virtual machines, etc. When manual
testing is needed, you will need to document your test plans for future
use. We have made great progress in writing unit tests for new and old
work, but we would greatly benefit from improved functional testing.

We're a small, privately held company (under 20 employees) founded in 2002,
and we've been profitable for many years. As an employee of MaxMind, you'll
enjoy the flexibility and autonomy that come with being a member of a small
technical team. Since we are profitable, our focus is on exploring new
ideas and doing things well, rather than rushing work to market. We're a
casual, friendly, results-focused company. We want you to get things done,
but it's also important to have a life outside the office. We won't be
asking you to stay late or pull all-nighters on crazy deadlines.

Transaction fraud detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is
never done. Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection,
which means we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud
detection service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP
product, which associates geographical data with individual IP addresses.
We screen half a billion online transactions each year and provide IP
intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

Our office is located in downtown Waltham, MA outside of Boston, five
minutes walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus
lines. However, our development team is scattered around two continents, so
telecommuting is fine.

The vast bulk of our code base is written in Perl using MySQL (but moving
to Postgres) and Linux, with a bit of C where it's needed. We use free
software as much as possible, and we release code back to the community
when we can do so. We're trying to improve the way we do development, and
we expect you to participate in that process. We are working to add more
tests and documentation to our code base, and all new work goes through
code review.

This position is for an experienced developer with a solid QA background.
The salary range for this position is from $100-140k per year.

Minimum Qualifications:

* Experience writing tests based on user requirements.
* Experience with testing tools such as Jenkins, Selenium, etc.
* Ability to communicate clearly with end users to interpret bug reports
and document them for developers.
* Dynamic language programming experience. We use Perl but we're happy to
hear from Javascript, PHP, Python, or Ruby developers as well.
* Understanding of SQL databases (MySQL and Postgres, specifically)
* Experience developing on a Linux or BSD platform.
* Experience with version control, preferably Git.
* Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
* The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.

Bonus skills:

* Performance testing/benchmarking experience.
* FS/OSS contributions. Tell us about them!

To apply, please email your resume to qa-engineer-job@maxmind.com as an
attachment or link in PDF, HTML, or plain text format. Resumes in other
formats will not be considered.
