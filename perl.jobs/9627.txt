Job title: Sr. Systems Engineer / Perl Developer

Company name: a 10-year-old publicly-traded "startup"

Location: United States, CA, Silicon Valley

Pay rate: $130-160k+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Join a team of top-notch senior systems engineers who automate the system
administration (monitoring, repair, scaling, planning, etc) of the
databases & web applications at our several datacenters.

Superior benefits, excellent perks, and an unrivaled salary are waiting for
the right candidate.  

Required skills:
1. Scripting Perl and other languages to support:
- scalable & automated monitoring (logging, regression, threshold alerting)
processes - Nagios and storage silo management
- fine-grained disaster-recovery and capacity planning for large
deployments (Solaris, Linux, Oracle)

2. Interacting within and without your team to plan/prepare for the above.

Desired skills:
As a Senior Systems Engineer, you are expected to be able to JFDI with
*any* software tools/languages you can find/create, but within the
constraints of a SOX-regulated, publicly-traded (and profitable!) company.

Your experience includes 5 years experience in a *n*x production
environment, and you know the ins-and-outs of kernel tuning (Solaris and/or
Linux), driver debugging, TCP debugging, and system crash root cause
analysis.  You prefer to write software tools to automate your work, except
for those tasks that you *KNOW* you will do only once. ;)  You have helped
maintain datacenters where the storage silos number in the double digits.
