Anybody need some Perl polished?

Are you depending on some legacy scripts (e.g., awk, Perl, sed,
or shell code) that you'd rather not inspect too closely?  Stuff
that seemed obvious (or even "cute") when it was written, but
now merely baffles and annoys? "Spaghetti" code? Undocumented
code?

If so, I may have an answer for you.  I'm an unusual combination:
copy-editor, technical writer, and senior script wizard.  Odder still,
I actually _enjoy_ code review, bug fixing, testing, documentation, and
maintenance programming!

I'm primarily a Perl programmer, mostly under Unix. I also do technical
documentation and QA. I'm available for contract programming work --
full-time or part-time, short term or longer term.

I excel at problem analysis and documentation, solution design and
specification, technical writing, and strategy. My skills and interests
include all aspects of the programming process, from analysis and design
through testing and maintenance. My programming interests are mostly for Perl
under Unix; I can also work with C when the occasion arises.

If you need to have new tools written, or processes created; if
you want your existing code reviewed,  steam-cleaned, documented and
put into a more comprehensible state, let me know...

My current contract expired May 11, so I'm looking for
something new. Please let me know (off list) if you have any openings. Feel
free to forward this to anyone else who might be looking for a Perler.

My job skills, preferences, and resume are available online at
http://cantaforda.com/~vlb/CRC/jobskills.html.
