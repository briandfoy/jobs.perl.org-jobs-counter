Job title: Agile Network Perl Developer

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Pay rate: 80-90K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
ok( $you->enjoy_problem_solving() );
ok( $you->strive_for_simplicity() );
ok( $you->write_tests_first() );
ok( $you->want_to_enjoy_your_job() );

Do you pass these tests? If so, you should be writing software at Airwave
Wireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of
our time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback
loops speak louder than excessive documentation and month-long design
meetings. We practice test-driven development and have a comprehensive
suite of tests... over 26,000 at last count. We pair program, so you'll
learn the system quickly and have a great time doing it. We have short
release cycles, which means your talents won't sit idle working on projects
that never see the light of day. Software you write today will be managing
enterprise networks in just a couple of weeks. We've been cited as the
longest running continuous XP project in the industry (five years and
counting) so we have gotten quite good at embracing advantages while
avoiding its pitfalls.

Personally, I enjoy working at Airwave more than any job I've ever had.  I
am excited to come into work every day, I work hard for eight hours solving
challenging problems, and then go home to lead a well balanced life outside
of work.  When I'm at work I get to interact closely with a group that is
brilliant, funny, motivated, and inspiring.  I spend most of the day
smiling, laughing, and learning.  The team we've built is truly a special
group, and I'm proud and honored to be a part of it.

Excited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. Airwave developers write software
in several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux
systems. We use Apache mod_perl2 for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for
our back-end persistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge
of network protocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP.

Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task, but our products help to
ease that burden. We build network management software that is used by many
of the leading IT organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major
universities, hospitals, and other prominent institutions. Our
industry-leading software helps plan, configure, manage, and monitor some
of the largest wireless networks on the planet.

Responsibilities: The software engineer's responsibilities include
designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code that is part of a
shipping enterprise network management and monitoring software package.

So, is this the job for you? Are you the next member of the Airwave
development team just waiting to be discovered? If so, send your resume to
jobs@airwave.com and I'll get right back to you.
