Job title: Full Stack Developer

Company name: NewsNow

Location: Remote or London, UK

Pay rate: =C2=A340-=C2=A355k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
NewsNow is a rare beast: a UK-based =E2=80=98dot com=E2=80=99 success story=
; a publisher
and technology company running the extremely successful news aggregation
platform NewsNow.co.uk.=20
Founded in 1997 to democratise and disrupt the
market for news, NewsNow has built up a solid brand and huge user base. Our
news product is driven by a unique hybrid of technology and editorial,
unlike any other news outlet.
We are now searching for a London-based or
Remote Full Stack Developer to join our highly-experienced and
multi-disciplinary product development and engineering team. In this role,
you will be involved in enhancing the functionality of the website and
improving our codebase and infrastructure through both client-side and
server-side development.  Our priorities for 2018 and beyond include:

The
biggest product overhaul in our 20 year history.
Launching a US version of
the site, NewsNow.com.
Continued evolution of our pioneering ad stack.

As
a Full Stack Developer, you will be expected to contribute authoritatively
towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack:
from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through
writing business logic and prototyping presentation.
You will also be
expected to review others=E2=80=99 code and play a role in administering our
systems and keeping NewsNow running 24/7.

At NewsNow, product development
is a team sport. So you'll also be invited to collaborate with other
members of our product development and engineering team in conceiving
development efforts, researching and specifying planned product
enhancements.

Desired skills:
The NewsNow website is powered by clean, well-crafted, object-oriented
Perl. We=E2=80=99re looking for a passionate Perl developer with web experi=
ence to
join our agile and talented engineering team.

As most of our stack is
written in Perl, we are naturally looking for someone who is an OO Perl
developer. However, the role may also suit a candidate with OO skills in
another high-level language, as well as a willingness to learn.
Additionally, you will have prowess in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, as well
as knowledge of MySQL/SQL.
You=E2=80=99ll have a keen eye for detail, and excellent
written and verbal communication skills.
You=E2=80=99ll be able to demonstrate an
understanding of the principles behind great software design, allowing you
to write code that=E2=80=99s clean, fast and scalable.
You=E2=80=99ll also have a track
record of remote working or working with remote team members.

We are
looking for someone who is open to new technologies, but isn't a slave to
them - you relish crafting elegant solutions to hard technical problems,
whatever tool is best.

Ideally you will be UK-based and have experience of
working remotely, or with remote teams, and will be the kind of person who
thrives in a small, open and collaborative team.=20

Finally, if you're also
passionate about any areas of news or sport, then this could really be the
company for you.
