Job title: Research Software Engineer - Workflow Applications

Company name: SDL

Location: Los Angeles, CA, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Workflow Engineer is responsible for maintaining and extending the
proprietary workflow platforms used to train statistical models for
language translation. The workflows are used in both research and
production, and contain dynamic and rapidly evolving technologies. They are
built on grid middleware, and run on both in-house and cloud data centers.

The position offers many interesting challenges and opportunities. We
implement advanced algorithms and apply them to extremely large datasets;
we write software that runs in various environments such as a local
cluster, in the cloud, or in a MapReduce environment; all team members can
contribute to all aspects of the project, such as
development/QA/architecture design/performance tuning/research.

The responsibilities of the position include: measuring and optimizing the
workflows' performance, error rate, repeatability, and resource
consumption; collaborating closely with the science team to transition
research code directly into the workflows; collaborating closely with IT to
address issues at the interface of the workflows with the grid middleware
and operating system layers; managing and extending the code design
patterns, architecture, and automatic testing of the workflows; closely
monitoring the interaction of the workflows with the grid middleware
layers, and tuning it for robustness and performance.

The successful candidate:
•  employs an empirical methodology and validates ideas with data,
presented clearly to stakeholders on the science and IT teams.
•  balances strategic and short-term needs; validates and brings in
relevant new technologies. 
•  manages the migration of new inventions from the science team into the
workflows. 
•  communicates best practices to the science team, helping to foster an
"everyone is a developer" philosophy. 
•  collaborates with IT to diagnose systemic problems and invent workable
solutions. 

About SDL Language Weaver:

Language Weaver, Inc. was founded in 2002 to commercialize a breakthrough
approach to automatic language translation, based on research advances made
at the University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute
(USC/ISI). Language Weaver’s machine translation software product uses a
statistical, rather than the traditional rule-based, approach to natural
language processing and translation to produce the highest probability
output.   In July 2010 Language Weaver was acquired by SDL and became SDL
Language Weaver. 

SDL is the leader in Global Information Management (GIM) solutions that
empower organizations to accelerate the delivery of high-quality
multilingual content to global markets. Its enterprise software and
services integrate with existing business systems to manage the delivery of
global information from authoring to publication and throughout the
distributed translation supply chain. SDL offers clients an end to end
Global Information Management Solution.  The business is growing rapidly,
both organically and through acquisition, and derives approximately 50% of
its revenues through North American based clients.

Quite simply, we accelerate the way the world communicates!

Required skills:
•  BS or greater in Computer Science/Engineering or related discipline (MS
is a plus); or equivalent practical experience.
•  Experience working with medium- to large-scale workflows running in
Condor, Sun Grid Engine, or Hadoop.
•  Fluency in Perl. 
•  Knowledge of Java, C++ or C.

Desired skills:
•  Experience working with MapReduce systems
•  Experience with or interest in statistical machine translation,
statistical natural language processing and/or machine learning is
desirable, but we will motivate you!
