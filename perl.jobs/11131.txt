Company name: Campus Explorer, Inc.

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
Campus Explorer, Inc. is a fast-growing web startup with demonstrated
success and great prospects. We moved into a new office with nice views of
the Santa Monica mountains and lots of fine restaurants across the street.

You'll be joining the existing team members at Campus Explorer, who have
played critical roles in a number of early stage startups and established
companies in the LA area and beyond including: Rent.com, TicketMaster,
RedEnvelope.com, ThisNext.com, Gifts.com, eToys.com, Evo.com, Stamps.com,
Citysearch.com, NFL.com, CarsDirect.com, and more.

We help connect students with post-secondary schools, colleges, and
universities, and we have fun building services with many cool technologies
like:

- Amazon AWS/EC2
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Perl
- Apache/mod_perl
- MySQL
- Catalyst
- Template Toolkit
- Moose
- memcached
- Perlbal
- Puppet
- and many more...

You don't have to know all of these, but you do need to know Perl, and know
it well.

Campus Explorer is VC funded and offers salary, equity, and benefits in
addition to the enjoyable working environment, great co-workers, flexible
hours, and cool technology. If you're looking for casual competence and
low-pressure high-productivity where clean design and simple automation
rules, then let's talk.


Required skills:
Advanced Perl, reasonable SQL, general hard core development, and decent
Linux system administration (you'll be managing your own Ubuntu
workstation).
