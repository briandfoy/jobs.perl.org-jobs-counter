Job title: perl person to help get a script running

Company name: private individual

Internal ID: none that I know of

Location: United Kingdom, Oxfordshire, Oxford

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: you tell me

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I recently wrote to the perl.beginners group about a problem I was having
but I got ignored. Maybe I wasn't advanced enough for them. :-)
My reasons for wanting to learn perl are practical and commercial.
I'd like to become a proficient buyer and seller on eBay.
I read David A Karp's book "ebay Hacks" in which he recommends the use of
perlscripts for automating eBay searches. The example files he gives don't
seem to be working for me at present. Maybe it's because the originals were

written to be run on a unix-like system and I'm running win-xp.
Anyway I've tried various modifications but so far I don't have enough
skill to overcome the problems. 
I'd be glad to pay for any advice or help on this subject. I can pay by
PayPal or other methods. Please email me if you're interested.

Required skills:
ActivePerl; WWW-Search-Ebay module (and associated script)
Windows XP.

Desired skills:
magician, miracle worker, philanthropist (paid).
