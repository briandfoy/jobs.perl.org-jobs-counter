Description:
SpareRoom was launched in 2004. Since then we've helped over 10 million

with. We believe living with the right people beats living alone, so our
mission is a simple one - to create happier flatshares.

We're a modern
family business, 100% owned by the founder and directors. That means we're
able to put our users at the heart of everything we do and we love working
with humble people who bring a positive energy and like to get stuff done.

We are looking for a developer to join us to increase the delivery capacity
of our core team. Our core platform is written mostly in Perl (with small
projects in Node.js and C#) and supports both an API for apps (iOS and
Android) and a web front end.

- To work with modern Perl for our main web
application and use other technologies, languages and tools like MySQL,

well-tested, and performant way.
- Develop and extend RESTful APIs.
- To
help maintain current mailshots and extend our in-house email tools to

- Small iterative releases
-
Continuous testing environment
- Test Driven Development
- Collaboration
over isolation
- Short lived, self-organised, project teams

projects.
- Have an interest in working across all areas of the system
including performance and security.
- Have experience with Relational
Databases (e.g. MySQL) and common web technologies.
- Have an interest in
working with Perl (experience would be considered a significant plus but
not a requirement as training will be provided).
- Enjoy collaborating with
others to solve complex domain problems.
- Enjoy finding quick solutions to
customer issues.

- Competitive
salary.
-Flexible, fun and challenging work environment where innovative
ideas are encouraged
- Central Manchester location in modern spacious
offices, with free fruit, a posh coffee machine and a housekeeper to keep
