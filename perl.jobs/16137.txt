Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Location: Ladera Ranch, CA, United States

Pay rate: DOE, but usually $75K to $150K

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey develops cutting-edge software for web surveys and online
reports.  Sure, there are many ways to deploy simple web surveys, but we
focus on the most complex and tricky projects.	For example, we run
Fortune's Most Admired Company's survey, which goes out to thousands of
CEOs and Fortune 1000 board members.  We handle complex surveys that go out
to hundreds of doctors, with each one being paid a few hundred bucks to
take the survey.  So our software has to handle things like quotas, complex
branching, fraud detection, and many other things that simple tools don't
even think of doing.  We also need advanced tools that allow clients to
slice and dice the survey data we collect.  All of our software is
web-based, and we use it internally and license it via an SaaS model.

Note
that we aren't looking for people to program surveys with this posting.  We
already have another team that does survey programming and works with
market research clients on a daily basis.  This posting is all about
finding candidates to build the software that builds the surveys.  We need
programmers who can write clean, modular code to help us extend and improve
our software.  Now is a great time to join our team, since we just
completed a major new release of our software, and have a backlog of new
features to build.  We are using modern OO Perl code, including Moose and
Plack/PSGI. On the front-end, we use javascript, including jQuery and the
ExtJS library.

Experience with the technologies we use is great, but more
important that any particular skill is the ability to learn quickly, figure
things out on the fly, and make things happen.	We are willing to train new
team members as needed to fill in any gaps in experience.

In addition,
because we are a small team, team members need to be able to wear many hats
and fill in where needed.  Everyone helps with client support, and some
server administration and IT work comes up from time to time as well, so
adaptability and experience in these areas is helpful as well.

We will
consider a range of candidates, from entry-level to experienced.

*About
IntelliSurvey, Inc.*
We're a small, growing company.  Currently we have
about 100 employees, and we are planning to grow significantly over the new
few years.  We are funded entirely through operating cash flow, however, so
we are stable and free to grow at our own pace.

We offer standard benefits
such as a retirement plan with company match, health and dental insurance,
stock options, and so on.  Many of our employees work remotely, so our
offices in Ladera Ranch, CA are small, and we can't offer a company
cafeteria.  But we are very flexible and focus on results rather than face
time.  After initial training, our development team members can have
flexible work hours and some work from home arrangements as well.

People
who are self-starters and can work independently will fit in well with our
team.

Desired skills:
&bullet; object-oriented Perl programming experience
&bullet; the ability
to write clean, modular, and understandable code
&bullet; excellent
communication skills
&bullet; the ability to work well in teams
&bullet;
the ability to learn quickly and apply new skills to the task at hand.
&bullet; Moose and OO Perl
&bullet; DBI and PostgreSQL and/or general
database experience
&bullet; Web development
&bullet; Experience with web
servers, particularly nginx and uwsgi
&bullet; MongoDB=20
&bullet; Version
control experience, particularly with git
&bullet; Linux system
administration skills are a plus
&bullet; Javascript, and in particular
experience with the ExtJS and jQuery libraries would be helpful, but is not
required, particular since the focus of this position is on back-end
development.
&bullet; A sense of humor
