Company name: DigitalWork / Zoomshare

Location: United States, IL, Chicago

Pay rate: Negotiable, based on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
DigitalWork, a web development company based in downtown Chicago, is
seeking a technically astute, down-to-earth individual with advanced Perl
application development experience. We're a small shop where each team
member has significant input and influence. We have a number of exciting
projects going on, including our web community, zoomshare, currently home
to over 400,000 individual web sites and growing.
 
This is a very diverse role, and not your traditional developer position.
Our environment gives you the flexibility to contribute and influence every
aspect of product development and design. We’re looking for someone who can
dive in deep to the back-end of applications, but who feels comfortable in
the front-end as well. We’re not looking for a UI designer, but the ability
to develop clean and functional front-ends for your applications is
required.

Responsibilities include:
=========================
- Design and development of web applications
- Specifically, applications developed may include tools for web design and
publishing, image manipulation, searchable directories, instant messaging,
e-commerce and advertising systems
- Enhancement, optimization and troubleshooting of existing code base as
needed
- Assisting on development projects for our Client Services team as needed
- Other technical tasks based on your skill set as the need arises

Required skills:
- Extensive experience in Perl application design and development
- Experience developing database-driven applications (we use PostgreSQL)
- JavaScript (some AJAX preferred)
- HTML (using CSS for design)


Desired skills:
Experience with any of the following is a plus:
===================================================
Apache/mod_perl, CVS, PHP, ASP, .NET, VB, participation in any Open Source
projects
