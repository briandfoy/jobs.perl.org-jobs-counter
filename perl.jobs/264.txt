Job title: Perl Apps/Web Engineer

Company name: Electronics For Imaging

Location: United States, CA, Foster City

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Perm

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
	We are building a next generation internet printing system here at
Electronics For Imaging (EFII). The Web apps portion is heavily
Apache/ModPerl/HTML::Mason/Oracle based running under Linux and Solaris. I
am looking for someone that can help round out the team and work on more
back-end functionality. Initially this is the e-commerce/ERP integration,
XML integration with other system components as well as 'modernizing' our
initially developed architecture and helping to clean up the code base so
that moving forward is not quite so painful.

	EFI is a mid-sized( 1000 employees or so ) public company that is
doing just fine in the current market. We have not had any lay-off's and
are growing at a comfortable rate, our stock is stable and we always meet
our market expectations. All in all its a comfortable place to weather this
storm. The PrintMe team runs as an 'internal startup', that means its
pretty relaxed and divorced from many of the day-to-day issues that would
normally come with working in a larger company.

	Looking for the usual skill-set, experience with mod-perl/apache,
ability to build your own architecture and framework from the ground-up and
the ability to write code that plays well with others. I really enjoy
people that come to the table with an overall understanding of how things
work together and a somewhat proven track-record.

	If your interested drop me an email. We are located in Foster City,
CA, just south of San Francisco.

	See us on the web at http://www.printme.com/ or http://www.efi.com/
