Description:
The Washington University Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) is seeking
candidates for an Assistant Manager of the LIMS group. This position
oversees senior and junior programmers, reports to the Manager of LIMS and
coordinates development with other LIMS Assistant Managers. The LIMS
Assistant Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire life cycle of
end-user software projects, from requirement collection to design to
implementation/testing/documentation to delivery to support. The types of
applications range from command-line to GUI to web and from text-processing
to cross-database transactions. This manager will be responsible for
interfacing with lab managers, scheduling developer projects, estimating
delivery time, and ensuring all projects progress and are delivered as
scheduled.


Required skills:
Applicants must have extensive software development experience, preferably
in dynamically-typed languages, e.g., Perl and Ruby, and large database
applications. Experience in software project management and programmer
management is required. Extensive knowledge of programming practices, e.g.,
requirements gathering, OOP, XP, and Agile development, and developer
tools, e.g., testing, debugging, and revision control, will be required to
do the job effectively. High-level skills in abstract software design and
relational data modeling are required. The successful candidate will be
extremely detail oriented, willing to learn new things, and have the
ability to manage many projects and tasks simultaneously, ensuring they all
are completed successfully and on time. Familiarity with Free/Libre/Open
Source Software and doing development on the GNU/Linux platform is strongly
desired.


Desired skills:
A college degree in Computer Science or related field with 5 to 10 years
experience in a similar position is required. An advanced degree is a plus.
