Job title: Release Manager

Company name: Rent.com

Internal ID: RM-FTE

Location: Los Angeles, CA, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Rent.com is the leading online apartment rental listing service nationwide.
 We are headquartered in a beautiful Santa Monica class A office complex,
not far from the sunny Southern California beaches.  We have over 300 days
of sunshine within a region that encompasses ocean beaches, deserts and
mountains.  With just over 100 employees we are light on bureaucracy and
operate nimbly.

As our Release Manager, you will own the test, build, and release
infrastructure for multiple projects.  This will include designing and
implementing processes and tools to support continuous integration and
testing.  In addition, the Release Engineer will be an evangelist for good
software engineering practices.

Rent.com engineers relish the freedom to create the next generation of our
offerings, in an environment designed to foster collaboration, creativity,
health, and happiness.	We are an agile shop utilizing scrum, story points,
and encouraging (but not dictating) TDD.

This is an FTE position.  We strongly prefer an on-site candidate; we will
consider full-time telecommuting only if you are exceptional and can
outshine the competition.  We can only consider US residents at this time.

Required skills:
Solid Perl, some SQL, some bash.  You should have a bit of a systems
administration (or DevOps) bent.  You will be responsible for our weekly
pushes to production, so reliability is key.  You will coordinate with all
sprint teams, especially QA, so good communication skills are a must.  You
must be familiar with version control systems, managing staging and
development branches, etc.  Knowledge of automated testing (and in
particular TAP) is a must.  You must have enough of a development mindset
that you can help define best practices and automate tools for source
control, continuous integration, automated testing and release management.

Desired skills:
Git, GitHub, Gitolite.	Makefiles.  QA experience.  Experience contributing
to open-source projects.  Experience with cloud environments such as Amazon
AWS, Eucalyptus, Open Stack, etc.  Experience designing architectures for
continuous integration, release management, distributed systems, etc.
