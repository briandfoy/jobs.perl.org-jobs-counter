Job title: Web Application Developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C25

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys, reports and related
applications for a variety of clients in the market research industry. We
offer both software licensing via an SaaS model for our do-it-yourself
clients, and we program surveys and applications using our own software on
a project-by-project basis for clients who would rather outsource. We're
looking for bright, enthusiastic developers to join our small team.

Required skills:
Our core software is built using Object Oriented Perl, Apache/mod_perl and
Postgres running on Linux servers, so our ideal candidate will be
experienced in these tools.  We also use ajax and Javascript frameworks,
especially YUI and Ext JS, so experience with these is helpful. You should
be comfortable on a Linux command line.

More important, however, is a good foundation in overall programming
skills, and the ability to learn and apply new skills quickly. We need
people that are adept at sorting through a large codebase to quickly find
bugs or identify points of entry for new features. The position will
involve significant design work and new features evolve quickly, so we need
someone who can take the initiative to figure out what needs to be done,
and then make it happen.

Depending on your background and experience, you may also be responsible
for helping to monitor and manage our servers, and for providing technical
support to our clients.

Finally, because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked
to wear different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to
help the company grow and prosper.
