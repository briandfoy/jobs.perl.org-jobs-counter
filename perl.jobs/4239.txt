Job title:
Developers with web-centric skills required

Company name: Private

Internal ID: DrTech

Location: Global

Pay rate: Market dependent

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
I am an independent perl contractor, and I have more work than I can
handle.  Also, sometimes my clients require skills that I don't have.

I am interested in forming a network of programmers, designers, database
admins, sys admins etc so that together we can form a group of trusted
professionals to take on bigger jobs.

We would work as project-based independent contractors, doing only
telecommute work, and free to work on our own projects.  But as a network
we can provide a more consistent reliable and faster service to our
clients.

Required skills:
Because the idea is that we have different skillsets available to the
network, there is no specified list of required skills.

However, most of my work is LAMP based, and I'm looking for experience
with:
 - object oriented perl
 - mod_perl
 - Apache
 - Linux
 - MySQL
 - PHP
 - HTML/CSS/Javascript/AJAX
 - XML
 - SOAP
 - Sysadmin stuff
 - Design

The language of communication would be English, so fluency in English is
required.


Desired skills:
I am looking for experienced professionals who can work independently.

However, there are complex and simple tasks, and it may be that a more
junior developer can handle a simple task perfectly adequately without
costing as much as a senior developer.

I want people who write clean, maintainable documented code and who have
verifiable experience in their particular field.

Country is not important, but a good internet connection is.

Developers need to be able to work indepedently, but be used to
collaborating remotely. Ability to deliver to deadlines is important.
