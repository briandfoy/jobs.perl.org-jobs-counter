dedicated QA team and separated dev, QA, and production environments. We
collaborate over IRC, use GitHub for version control, and Redmine for
project management in an agile environment.

IRC channel, no admin work whatsoever, and the opportunity to make a real
difference.  One day a week remote working may be available once settled.

a wide range of solutions across multiple brands.  We were recently
acquired by THG - The Hut Group, a fast-growing

language)
