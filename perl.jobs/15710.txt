Job title:
Parlez-vous Perl et Français, et voulez-vous habiter en Londres?

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: Market rate

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
That's about the limit of my French, but a wonderful client of mine in
London is looking for a Francophone Perl developer in their beautiful
Central London offices.

The company is committed to Modern Perl, sends its
developers to YAPC, and manages to maintain a lovely small company feeling
in its UK offices, despite being owned by a very large (and very
successful) parent company.

Great benefits, a great team, a project that's
all written using Mojolicious, Moose, DBIx::Class, and is deployed on a
scaleable AWS architecture.

Desired skills:
Modern Perl essential. Mojolicious, (Moo)se, DBIx::Class and AWS experience
all helpful, and some front-end skills with an interest in UI would be
helpful
