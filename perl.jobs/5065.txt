Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: To Be Negotiated

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: one month

Hours: Part time

Description:
I'm an experienced perl developer running a medium-sized website that I'd
like to transition into using Perl's Catalyst Framework.

Our team is seeking someone experienced with development using the Perl
Catalyst Framework to help with short- or medium-term development (anything
from a week or two, to several months of work are possible).

We understand that using Perl's Catalyst system is a developed skill and
would like to hire the best possible person. We also seek to provide a
flexible and supportive work environment for the benefit of all people
involved.

We could start as early as next week if you're the right person. We're
happy to discuss the project before finalizing a rate. We'd prefer to pay
by the hour, but will consider paying by the project if that's how you
prefer to work.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Required skills:
* PERL
* CATALYST
* CPAN
* Strong communications skill

Desired skills:
System administration, GUI design, or architecture experience a plus.
