Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Bluehost

Location: Provo, Utah

Pay rate: BOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Perl Developer will be part of a new team building the next generation
user interface solution for novice users that sign up for web hosting. This
team has high visibility in the company and is important for our ongoing
success and value differentiation. You will be one of the core developers
who will help deliver on the product vision.

* Talented Perl programmer – You have been around the block a few times and
are comfortable using Perl to make web apps work.
* Object Oriented Perl – You think Perl is more than "just a scripting
language" and know how to make it do things others can’t. Plus you
understand how Perl’s object orientation differs from other languages such
as C# and Java.
* Web Experience – You are familiar with how the web works, and can hit the
ground running writing web applications and tools.
* Open source world – You have lived in open source code for most or a good
part of your career and are not a fan of the commercial software world. For
example, you have no problem using Vim as your “IDE” for Perl.
* Team Player – You work well as part of a team, and are willing to take
direction, but can be trusted to get things done on your own.
* Hard Working – Once you get your bearings, you are heads-down and
tenacious in completing assigned projects.

Required skills:
At least 4 years experience as a Perl developer
Must be competent developing Web applications and system utilities
Must be able to create Perl modules
Must be competent with object oriented Perl
Must be knowledgeable with Linux and basic system administration
Ability to stay on task, solve problems, and accomplish tasks in a timely
manner
Able to work well with other team members
