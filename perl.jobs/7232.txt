Job title:
Perl/DBI/HTML programmer for the SurfShopPRO eCommerce System

Company name: The Working Mac

Location: United States, Washington, Seattle

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for Perl programmers to join the development team of the
SurfShopPRO eCommerce System.  SurfShop is an existing, Perl based shopping
cart that has many nice features, with some not being found in any program
in it's price range.  There are a few bugs that need to be fixed, plus new
features that need to be added.  

This would be a telecommuting job, so you can reside anywhere, however a
mastery of the English language is a must - spoken and written. 

All code must be commented extensively and participation in the support
forum is required.

Pay is negotiable.  We pay via PayPal once fix/feature has been
successfully tested.

We are looking to make this the best cart on the market.  Serious inquiries
only, please.

Required skills:
You must be able to hit the ground running, and have a thorough knowledge
of Perl, DBI, MySQL (also ASCII and DBM databases), HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, and be willing to work on an existing project.  Knowledge of
other technologies would be a plus.
