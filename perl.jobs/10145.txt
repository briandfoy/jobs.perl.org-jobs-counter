Job title:
Senior Software Engineer - Web Application Development

Company name: LiveOps, Inc

Internal ID: LOPS-SRSWENGR

Location: United States, CA, Santa Clara

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Leverage your senior level developer and large based application experience
for LiveOps, Inc., the world's best-in-class virtual call center operation.
Your desire to work with a large sprawling web based application platform
team will make you a perfect fit. This is the ideal opportunity for that
next step in your career path which will give you that edge you have been
looking for. If you are looking to expand your technical knowledge, grow in
your expertise and have the hunger for a fast paced environment then you
need to apply today.

LiveOps is revolutionizing the world of work, starting with the virtual
call center. Our company has a world-class management team that includes
leaders from Genesys, eBay, Salesforce.com, Siebel, and Tellme - and an
amazing and enthusiastic engineering team that includes original founders
and engineers from Netscape/Mosaic, AOL, eBay and Microsoft. We have built
the most advanced on-demand call center platform anywhere to help companies
make their existing call centers more virtual. We've not only established
the future of distributed work, we've made it a reality today. A privately
held company backed by Menlo Ventures and Benchmark Capital, LiveOps has
been consistently growing revenue rapidly and is led by one of the top
visionaries in Silicon Valley Maynard Webb, the former COO of eBay. Come
join one of the most exciting companies in the Bay Area and be part of a
world class team building the next eBay and Salesforce.com. We are
financially and strategically backed by Menlo Ventures, Benchmark and CMEA.
We have been profitable since 2006 with a solid financial track record, and
on a sound growth path to becoming a major player in the contact center
space.

In this role, based in our Santa Clara headquarters, you will lead and work
with other team members, in taking the LiveOps platforms applications into
our next phases of growth. This will require efforts in refactoring
existing code as well as working on new products and features. Your
experience with Linux, Ruby, Perl, Java, MySQL, other various open source
technologies, as well as home-grown technologies will ensure you hit the
ground running. Perl/mod-Perl/Mason is our platform for web application
development, but you will also be required to program in Ruby-on-Rails. We
practice Agile development methodologies (SCRUM). This is an excellent
opportunity to be on the front lines in taking the company to the next
level. You'll gain a strong understanding of the virtual call center
domain, and apply sound engineering practices (i.e. code/design
documentation and reviews, and unit/functional tests) to solve technical
challenges. In addition, there are many opportunities to be mentored by
numerous industry veterans. This position, reporting directly to the
Manager of Application Engineering, will play a key role on a strong
engineering team, providing for excellent professional growth
opportunities. Join our team today.
