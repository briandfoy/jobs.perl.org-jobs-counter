Description:

// WHO WE ARE

We are Pobox.  (We are also Listbox).  We've been around since before the
Internet was cool, offering all kinds of email-related services.

We're a small company located in center city Philadelphia.  It would be
awesome if you're in our neighborhood, but we'll consider telecommuting for
the right person.  It's a pretty comfortable and casual office, so don't
panic.

We like open source; it runs our business. As much as possible, we try to
write our code so that we can release it -- it's easier to write good code
when you know other people will see it.

Feel free to sign up for a trial account of either service to see more
about what we do.

// WHO YOU ARE

You are a programmer who loves the web.  You like making cool web
interfaces. Not just cool, though; they're easy to use and are built around
the needs and assumptions of the user.	Every time you learn more about the
users, you think about how you can turn that into an interface improvement.


You have an opinion about which one of the popular JavaScript libraries you
like best.  Somewhere, deep inside, a little part of you likes fixing bugs
in
your page that only show up on Internet Explorer.  You unit test your
JavaScript code whenever you can.

You don't just write front-end code, though.  You know how to write the
server side code to manage your sessions, talk to the database, and do all
the stuff
that makes the front-end worth using.  Maybe you've used Rails or Django. 
Even better, you've used Catalyst and love working with it.

// WHAT'S THE JOB?

We've been around for a long time.  Here and there, we've let our web
interface grow a little outdated.  In other places, it's nice and modern,
but just needs to be kept up to date with modern libraries and kept
standard across all our services.  You'll be leading the charge against
outdated and duplicated code. You'll implement new parts of our user
interface to provide a slick user experience, and you'll bring existing
pages up to date to keep things easy to rely on and maintain.


Required skills:
Here's an unordered list of things you'd be working with:

  * jQuery	  * Catalyst	  * Mason
  * Charles	  * DBIx::Class   * RoundCube
  * Lighttpd	  * JSON	  * Rx Schema
