Job title: Computer science intern (perl)

Company name: Adzuna

Location: Clapham, London, UK

Pay rate: dependent on experience

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3 months+

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Adzuna is a search engine for classified ads founded by 2 serial
entrepreneurs. 

We are looking for interns for up to 12 weeks from January to May 2012. The
site is still very early stage, but is growing fast and is well funded by a
group of people behind the likes of Skype, Last.fm, Songkick, eBay and
Virgin.

We are looking to recruit a computer science intern with knowledge of perl
to support the growth and development of our next-generation classified ads
search engine.	This is a great opportunity to work with our experienced
team and learn about life in a start-up environment.

You will need good communication skills and attention to detail as well as
technical ability. You will also need to understand the importance of
building structured code that is fast, scalable, reliable and robust.  As
part of a very small but talented team you need to thrive working
independently and in a fast-moving, low-structure environment.

The projects you will be working on include new partner website and xml
feed integration, data analysis and administrative tools. Our systems have
been with scalability in mind, so the successful candidate must demonstrate
experience and ability to write scalable code to be run in distributed
environments.

Successful completion of the internship could lead to a full-time position.

Required skills:
Perl
Attention to detail
Computer science degree (could be in progress)

Desired skills:
Apache
MySQL
Fastcgi
SOLR
