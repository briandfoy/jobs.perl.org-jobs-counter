Description:
Hello.	My name's Chris; I'm a beginning Perl student looking for a tutor
by phone for ~1 hour per week going forward.  Duration is flexible, from 1
month to 1 year.

Required skills:
+6 months' full-time experience with Perl.  Patience to work with a
college-level student.	Reliable phone I can all you at within the
continental U.S.

Desired skills:
Topics to cover are very standard classroom examples & O'Reilly book
questions of my choosing.  I'm a very auditory/verbal learner and learn
much faster with someone to 'walk me through it.'  I've had an excellent,
very senior Perl tutor in the past, but his rate & his skills were far
beyond my needs.

888.974.9005.
