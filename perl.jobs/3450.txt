Job title:
Perl / PHP developer for digital media group

Company name: The Swish Group

Internal ID: RC051115

Location: Australia, Victoria, Melbourne

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
There is a position available for one (or maybe two) candidates for a
Perl/PHP developer role within a Linux environment - The highlights:
 
- Experience required in Perl, PHP, DHTML and Javascript
- Experience with XML/XSLT, RDBMS and system administration advantageous
- South Melbourne - small, focused company
 
The focus of this development role is primarily Perl/PHP, but experience
with XML/XSLT, relational database systems (Postgresql and MySQL) and
general Linux system administration would be advantageous.  Because of the
nature of the development work, a good working knowledge of DHTML,
Javascript and CSS is assumed.
 
The ideal candidate would be:
 
- Committed, resourceful and creative
- Able to accept responsibility, development and take genuine ownership for
project components
- Able to communicate in both a written and verbal manner with ease
 
This position offers great opportunity to work on some really gadgets
(video servers, embedded Linux set-top boxes) and cool projects, such as
digital-video-on-demand (one of our core products) and digital signage as
well as some more off-beat work (such as software integration for the Optus
Message Board at Federation Square).  Opportunity also exists for national
and international travel for project work.
 
In essence, this is a pretty nifty position for the right candidate with
plenty of opportunity to grow and develop.

Required skills: Perl, PHP, DHTML, Javascript, CSS

Desired skills:
XML/XSLT, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Linux system administration
