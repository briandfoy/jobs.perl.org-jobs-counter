Job title: mod_perl programmer for healthcare

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, watertown

Pay rate: $50-100+ US

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Who are we? 
We are a 400+ person rapidly-growing software/services company dedicated to
improving the lives of practicing physicians in the U.S.  We are one of the
few successful companies focused on making medical offices run more
efficiently. Our co-founders, Todd Park (Economics, Magna Cum Laude, Lowell
'93) and Jonathan Bush (HBS '98) both helped to found the managed care
consulting practice at Booz Allen & Hamilton.  We have won multiple #1
awards, enjoy revenues of $80+ million per year, and we're just getting
started.  

Why would you want to work here? 
We hire the best of the best: software developers, business analysts,
implementation consultants. If you're looking at Oracle/Microsoft/Google or
McKinsey/Bain/BCG, you'll feel right at home here.  Our product development
branch includes many alumni from Harvard and MIT, as well as former
professors from U. Chicago and Northeastern, a Rand Institute statistician,
and other smart folks who took the road less traveled.	We were also voted
one of the best places to work in Massachusetts by Boston Business Journal
(http://athenahealth.com/Home/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/BBJBestPlaces2005
/).  

In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of DHTML, CSS, and
JavaScript thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we
believe any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of
a couple of months or so. We're more interested in folks with raw talent
and a burning desire to succeed.  


Required skills:
Job Requirements : The Technologist should possess the skills necessary to
participate in the application programming of an Internet application.
(S)he must be able to prioritize and complete multiple tasks efficiently
and accurately. 

1. Substantial expertise in at least one of the following programming
languages: C, C++, Perl, Java, Ruby, Python.
a. A keen and inquisitive intellect
b. Ability to function as an integral part of the technology development
team


Desired skills:
if you're interested in applying please submit your resume along with a
solution to the following puzzle to the contact information below.


Puzzle:

You and a friend are about to eat a pizza.  You both consume pizza at
precise rates: it always takes you X seconds to eat a slice of pizza, and
it takes your friend Y seconds.  Once the pizza is cut, you will both start
eating at the same time. Each person can eat only one slice at a time.	You
cannot touch the next piece until you finish the one you’re eating.  Out of
generosity, you have agreed in advance to allow your friend to have the
last slice if you should both happen to reach for it at the same time. 
Assuming that you would like as much of the pizza as possible to end up in
your stomach, into how many equally-sized slices should the pizza be cut?
