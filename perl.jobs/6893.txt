Description:
Perl Senior Developer - OO Perl/Perl/MySQL/Linux - London

A fantastic opportunity for an experienced fast thinking Perl developer to
join our tight-knit team and to be part of our innovative ground-breaking
company, leading provider of the UK Internet press cuttings and news
aggregation industry. 

Started in 1997, NewsNow's services include NewsNow.co.uk, a winner of the
UK's Website of the  Year Awards 2006. NewsNow is continually "pushing the
envelope" as we look for new ways to make the wealth of online news a more
manageable and cost-effective experience for our clients and 1.1m website
users.

This challenging hands-on role comprises taking part in the team's design
decisions and implementing new functionality within our award-winning
consumer portal, our corporate subscription services and our custom-built
internal tools. 

Key design decisions will commonly be made in conjunction with other team
members and development and testing will be both autonomous and 'extreme'.
You will share system administration responsibilities and 'on call' duties
with the rest of the team.

Suitable applicants must have excellent communication skills as well as
technical abilities, logical and analytical approach to problem solving and
a minimum of 5 years programming experience and strong competencies in all
of the following:

Perl/OO Perl
Internet/web development (HTML, DHTML, CGI, TCP/IP, HTTP, XML, JavaScript,
DOM)
SQL (ideally MySQL)
Shell scripting (e.g. bash, awk, sed, grep)
C or C++
Linux system administration (ideally Debian)
PC server/networking hardware and architecture

If you are a productive, fast thinking individual who is aware of the
trade-offs between various design decisions and is able to communicate your
thinking both within your team and to non-technical staff, prospects and
clients, then please contact us on +44 (0)20 7471 0400 or email
janafcs@NewsNow.co.uk.(NO AGENCIES!!) 


Desired skills:
The ideal candidate will possess graphic design skills and also have
knowledge of bind, exim, apache, CVS, ipvs, heartbeat, linux kernel
recompilation, ssh, iptables.
