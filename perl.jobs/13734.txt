Job title: Perl Systems Developer

Company name: CV Bay

Internal ID: shperl

Location: Reading, UK

Pay rate: £50,000+

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
A leading International ISP, based in Reading, are looking to bring on
board a Senior Perl Developer. Your role will be working as a ScrumMaster
with a team of developers, to help manage technical architectures and
optimising services.

As a senior Perl developer, you will be working within an international
team with contacts across Europe, so good communication skills and
experience of working in a team is a must.

You should feel at home working in Perl (with a focus on system
integration), and experience of any other languages (preferably Python or
PHP) and Linux system administration would be a bonus.

Although it is a development role, you will also be responsible for
suggesting and implementing new approaches and system improvements, and act
as a point of reference when normal query escalation is unsuccessful. You
will also be developing new services and products to help with the growth
plans of the company.

Required skills:
•	3+ years experience of Perl development
•	2+ years experience with MySQL
•	Experience of working within a team environment (team lead
experience not required)
•	Experience with Application Clustering

Desired skills:
•	Linux Systems Administration experience
•	Experience with Revision Systems (Git / SVN)
•	TCP/IP and networking knowledge
