Job title: LAMP Programmer

Company name: School Loans Corp

Internal ID: lamp

Location: United States, Ca, Los Angeles

Pay rate: $40-$50k DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:

School Loans Corporation originates Federal and Private Student Loans for
parents, students and graduates, on behalf of our partners in the higher
education marketplace. Using primarily open source tools, we've developed a
web-based admin environment and workflow for marketing, processing and
funding student loans. 

We are looking for an ambitious young programmer to join our Southern
California office, primarily developing web interfaces using Apache +
ModPerl + TemplateToolkit. We have a small development team, so the ideal
candidate will be comfortable working on multiple projects as well in
interacting with end users and partners. 


Required skills:
Definite Requirements for this position: 

- A solid grasp of Perl is absolutely required for this position. No
kidding, and we will ask you questions. That means that you should have no
problem rolling complex data structures, or writing your own module to
implement an object. 

- Some experience with Apache is preferred, with extra points for
experience with writing modules using mod_perl. You don't necessarily have
to be comfortable unpacking Apache and compiling from source, but you
should at least be familiar with the Apache config (bonus points for
mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, ssl certs). 

- A good grasp of HTML, with bonus points for javascript or css layers
expertise. You won't by any means be expected to be a graphic artist, but
having a decent eye for layout doesn't hurt. 

- Good verbal and written communication skills. 


Desired skills:
Other skills that would be considered a plus: 

- Experience with XML 
- Experience with MVC frameworks 
- Experience with other OO languages (Java, C++, Ada, etc.)
