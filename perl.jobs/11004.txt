They have a current project in place where they are replacing an old legacy
system with a new Content Management and Publishing system.  The legacy
systems are primarily written in Perl.	When the new system is in place
they need to have it speak to the old systems which the developers will
need to add automation tests to the Perl code so both systems can talk.

The manager is looking for candidates who have experience with automated
testing in Perl environments. The responsibilities for the contractors will
be:
1.	Wrap the legacy systems in automated tests to reduce the risk of
making changes.
2.	Modify existing systems to enable encapsulation or replacement by a
new system currently under development by staff.
3.	Take on most of the day-to-day work on the existing systems, to
free up staff to work on the new systems.

The manager has also requested that when we submit candidates he would like

qualities that are listed below.  When submitting candidates please add the
candidates write up.
