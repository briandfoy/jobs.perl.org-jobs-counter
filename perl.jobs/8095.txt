Job title: Perl / LAMP Developer - Showcase Site

Company name: ChildrensIllustrators dot com

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Childrensillustrators dot com is looking to forge a lasting partnership
with a talented freelance PERL / LAMP developer.

The site currently showcases approximately 20,000 images from over 700
subscribing illustrators.

Built using Perl / MySQL  : Apache server.

The site uses a variety of modules including Image:Magic

Payments are made via Worldpay ( www.worldpay.com ) and Paypal.

As the current backend code has become rather disorderly we would like to
look at a complete re-write whilst implementing improvements in general.

We prefer to work with fixed quotations rather than open / hourly rates.
