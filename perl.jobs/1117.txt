readily understand. 

You will own and drive the engineering aspects of the projects you work on,
which are central to our corporate strategy. You will be part of a
first-rate engineering organization and must be ready to contribute. 

Required skills:
Minimum Experience Requirements: College degree in Computer Science,

5 years of software engineering experience 
Very strong Unix shell scripting skills

Familiarity with open source software development 
Strong verbal, written, analytical, and persuasive skills. 


Desired skills:
Desirable Experience: Solid experience with spam filtering or another
application of probability and statistics 
Familiarity with object oriented development techniques and Java
programming skills 
Experience with scalable internet systems
