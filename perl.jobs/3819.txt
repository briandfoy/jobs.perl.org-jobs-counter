Job title:
Email address validity checker via smtp rcpt to

Company name: Nerds On Site

Location: Canada, Ontario, London

Pay rate: negotiable in CAD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: this project only - could lead

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Data file input (text file) contains one full email address per line such
as:

david.redekop@gmail.com

Data file output needs to be two text files:

Validaddresses.txt
Invalidaddresses.txt
Exceptions.txt

The validation process does the following:

1) checks if the domain is valid
2) does an mx lookup
3) connects to mx hosts (in order of priority) in order of priority and
runs through an smtp
conversation as follows:

HELO emailtests.com
MAIL FROM: EmailTests <verify@emailtests.com>
RCPT TO: [input file email address]
[capture response]
QUIT

4) if previous step generated a 2xx response (accepted), then the email
address goes to Validaddresses.txt and if previous step generated a 5xx
response then it goes into Invalidaddresses.txt - any others go into
Exceptions.txt

No web interface required, we'll just run it from the command line.

Optional concurrency setting would be great - may not need concurrency,
but would be interesting to see what number we could verify overnight if
we do them sequentially.  Don't forget if primary MX fails then we should
try backup, etc.

While I'm at it, here is a _very_ simple test list against which to run it:


david@redekop.net (should succeed)
invalidmailbox@redekop.net (should fail because the mailbox is indeed
non-existent)

Also, I think we need one more file - invalidaddresses-log.txt and it
should contain all the invalid ones but also copy of the smtp status code
and text response such as "511 sorry, no mailbox here by that name (#5.1.1
- chkuser)" so each failed one may look like this:

invalidmailbox@redekop.net:[mxhost] responded:511 sorry, no mailbox here by
that name (#5.1.1 - chkuser)


Required skills: perl, dns, smtp protocol commands
