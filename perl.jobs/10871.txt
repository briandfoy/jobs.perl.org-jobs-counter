Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Paradigm Healthcare Services

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a developer who likes to get their hands into the rest
of the stack: someone who can rack a server and configure its operating
system to play nicely in the environment; someone who can troubleshoot a
down network connection; someone who can then write world-class software in
the environment they just built, and then beat it to death with tests; 
someone who has an opinion, or even two, on the best way to do all of the
above. 

Why work here?	We help schools and state agencies navigate bureaucracies
and collect funding so they can provide health services to poor and
underserved populations.  We’re a small company (~50 people) with a great
culture that’s using technology to change the way our corner of the world
works.	We are a leader in our field with a solid revenue stream and a 15
year company history, and we’re aggressively evolving our legacy system
into full buzzword compliance.	We expect you to learn something new every
day; you’ll walk out of here a much better developer/sys
admin/dba/technologist than you came in.

Who wouldn’t be happy here?  We practice something close to agile
development and make design choices as a team; if you like to work on your
own and/or don’t play nicely with others, you’ll be miserable.	We’re a
perl / oracle / CentOS shop; we have some other languages on the
peripherals, but you aren’t going to like working here if you can’t live
without your daily dose of java/ruby/lisp on windows.  We measure success
by the quality of the incremental improvements we produce; we don’t build
things from scratch.   

Interested?  Please send a cover letter, resume, and some sort of code
samples to jpeyton@paradigm-healthcare.com.  We’re looking forward to
meeting you.

-Perl in a web context
