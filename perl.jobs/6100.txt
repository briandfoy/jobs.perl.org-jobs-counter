Company name: Ticketmaster

Location:
United States, California, West Hollywood

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Ticketmaster is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Client
Tools team. Our charter is to replace legacy desktop applications with
cutting-edge web applications.	It’s a fun and exciting opportunity to push
the limits of web technology.

You may be called upon to develop new servers from scratch, lead design
meetings about core code modules, or refactor code that cuts across
multiple applications.

You will code primarily using Perl but may occasionally be required to
write C modules for Apache.

In a typical workday you'll work on a project coding new functionality, fix
a few bugs, eat some lunch, write some unit tests, and meet with your team
to design developing projects.

Required skills:
* Understanding of common design patterns
* Proficiency with Perl objects and object-oriented concepts
* Solid grasp of Apache and mod_perl
* SQL inserting, updating, retrieving, and optimization skills
* Thrive in a team-based environment
* Ability to clearly communicate technical concepts and designs to
non-developers
* Experience with version control, ideally CVS or Subversion

Desired skills:
* Community involvement with CPAN, Apache, mod_perl, or other open source
projects
* Experience building dynamic web applications with Javascript and Ajax
* Data design and modeling
* Experience with other languages such as C/C++, Lisp, Ruby, or Python
* Knowledge of agile methodologies such as Test Driven Development or Scrum

* Familiarity with development best practices, such as code reviews and
unit testing
* As your user base will be spread out across the globe, experience
developing international sites is a plus
* Experience with MySQL and Oracle
