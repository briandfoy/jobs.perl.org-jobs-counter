Subject: Looking for contract/permanent work in DC area
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: wade@wstrick.com (Wade Strickland)


I'm seeking contract or full time employment, preferably of a Perl nature, at an interesting and exciting company in the DC area. Part-time work is also a possibility.

I have extensive experience with Perl and started writing scripts back in May of 1996. I also have programming experience in PHP, Javascript, and VB. On the database side, I have design and maintenance experience with Oracle, MS SQL Server, and MySQL. Internet advertising and custom reporting have been my recent assignments, and I have experience with XML publishing and content delivery to third parties.

In addition to the requisite front-end UI experience with mod_perl (on Linux), I have back-end experience with ETL processing (Ab Initio), error notification, and database loading/export/backup functions.

My resume is available online at:
http://www.wstrick.com/

Thanks,
Wade Strickland
