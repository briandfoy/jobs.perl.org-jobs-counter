Job title: Perl Hacker

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Internal ID: 31337

Location: United States, MA, Somerville

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
About us

We're Best Practical Solutions, a small software company located in
Somerville, MA. We build software and sell support, training, consulting,
and custom development. Our main product, RT (Request Tracker), is the
premiere open source issue tracking system. We've been around since the
fall of 2001 and are entirely self-funded. We're currently hard at work on
our next new product. Things just keep getting busier.

About the job

We're looking for a Perl Hacker to help us enhance and refine our products,
and help us be excellent to our customers. You'll be responsible for
everything from implementing new features across all our products to
testing and applying user-contributed patches to our released software. In
a typical week, you'll probably spend about half your time working on
customer projects and half working on internal and open source projects.

The hours are flexible and we all telecommute some of the time...though we
work from our office in the heart of Davis Sq, Somerville, most days. We do
just about EVERYTHING online and on the phone. You should be comfortable
using email and instant messaging systems to collaborate and get work done.

Required skills:
About you

You should be a self-starter who has some experience with Perl, as well as
a bit of experience with at least a few of the following:

 * Open source development practices
 * Distributed source control
 * Test driven development
 * User interface design
 * Documentation
 * Javascript
 * SQL databases
 * Optimization, profiling, and debugging
 * UNIX systems administration

It's okay if you don't know everything out of the gate, but you should be
able to learn on the fly and be comfortable asking questions when you get
in over your head. RT is a large codebase to dive into, so you should be
prepared to work with a project that's too big to hold in your head at
once. If you want to see what sort of trouble you're getting yourself into,
you can find all of our open source code http://github.com/bestpractical/.
We're a small company and the boss is typically overextended. You should be
comfortable working both independently and in small teams, prioritizing
tasks on your own, and juggling tasks and projects.


Compensation

DOE - This is a full-time salaried position, but the details are
negotiable. We're a small, self funded company. The standard benefits
apply, of course: health insurance, dental insurance, and junk food to make
that dental insurance worthwhile.
