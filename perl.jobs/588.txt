Perl Gig, New York City 

NOTES DIRECT FROM THE CLIENT 

The situation is that we've got a 8-10 perl scripts written that load text
files into oracle.  We've got to get this in shape in the next
10 days and then there is some follow on work following.  We've have an
employee that was working on it, but I'm getting really concerned about his
ability to finish the job.  What he's done is in relatively good shape, but
I need commitment to finish the job and I'm not sure I'm getting it from
him.  It's kind of an ugly situation.
