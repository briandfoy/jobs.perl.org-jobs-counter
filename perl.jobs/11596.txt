Description:
Zappos IP, Inc. is looking for a Sr Mgr for our Front Office!
  
Why join us? In January 2011, Zappos.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries were
named #6 on the 2011 Fortune: 100 Best Companies to Work For List.
  
Why else? We offer an extensive benefits package for all full-time

And… we’re hiring like crazy right now, and looking for smart,

team.
 
Our team builds, integrates and maintains all the systems to support a
1600-person company including the website, warehouse management, order
management, and customer service systems. We can do this because each

and Marketing) 
Communicate and coordinate changes with other Zappos Family companies or
other partner companies 
Work with business users to set expectations and explain technology 
Mentor new managers 
Mentor developers on technology and engineering skills 
  
If you enjoy building complex enterprise systems and want the fun and feel
of a start-up company, but the solid management and resources of an
established business, we may be the place for you. Apply today! Relocation
is available to qualified candidates.
 
Zappos IP, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer and drug free workplace.


Required skills:
A minimum of 3 years as a manager 
A minimum of 6 years experience working on web-based, database driven
