Subject: Seeking entry-level PERL progamming position
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: chairman_mentos@yahoo.com (Chris Johnstone)

Hello all!

I am a senior enrolled at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst with one more semester left
to complete my degree in Computer Science. I am
currently employed as the primary programmer of the
Five College Finding Aids Project. In this project we
are using PERL to generate web forms to encode XML
finding aids which conform to the EAD standard
(http://www.loc.gov/ead/). As my employment will
terminate in December of 2001 because I will graduate,
I am seeking full-time or salaried employment after
that period. I am most interested in working in this
same area (preferably for a library), so I would
appreciate if any interested archivists or librarians
could drop me a line if they have time to tell me
about their projects. I am also interested in any AI
projects which could use a PERL progammer, as well as
any cutting edge XML project. I am willing to relocate
anywhere in order to expand my career horizon, but
prefer the Massachusetts area.

Chris Johnstone
