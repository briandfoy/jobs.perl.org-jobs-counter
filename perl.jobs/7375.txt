Job title:
C::A/Apache::Reg/MySQL web-app bug fixing contract

Company name: Golden Guru

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 75-100%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 1 month-ish with good chance o

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Client with an existing, reasonably large CGI::Application web-app running
on Debian needs bug fixes ASAP. The app was originally written as a pure
CGI app then dumped into Apache::Registry. Looking for a mid-level Perl
hacker who can step into the code to debug a handful of critical,
non-trivial bugs. Bugs include a broken emailing service, order processing
where some orders get “lost” in the system, missing reporting
functionality, and similar.

The majority if not all of the work could be done telecommute. However,
slight preference will be given to local (Seattle WA USA) candidates
because there may be some value in meeting face-to-face with the client’s
staff briefly at some point.


Required skills:
1. Very good Perl reading skills (existing code is readable-ish but not
great or documented)
2. Apache::Registry exposure (understand some of the issues with taking a
CGI app and dumping it into A::R)
3. MySQL experience (from POV of Perl web-app development)
4. Attention to detail; responsiveness; other various good traits you'd
expect to see listed here


Desired skills:
1. Experience with large but semi-architected C::A apps.
2. CGI::Application experience in general
3. Previous web-app/db debugging experience
