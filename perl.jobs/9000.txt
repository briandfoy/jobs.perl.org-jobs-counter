Job title: Perl Support/Training

Company name: chi

Internal ID: PST/SAC

Location: Brazil, São Paulo, São Paulo

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are using Perl to develop a GUI system to show a video feed and
diagnostics, as I am new to Perl it is taking a little time to get started.
 

I am planning to use wxPerl for the GUI stuff, and although it seems to
work, I have been completely unable to get a video to run in a window.

I should add an update to the above. I need help in a few areas, but I
don't need all of them now. The three areas are wxPerl (I suppose I could
use Tk, but wx seems to be more current), video (I don't mind whether we
harness something like wxMedia or build our own avi player - I'm quite
drawn towards the latter) and speech recognition in perl. I can't find
anything on that at the moment.

I am based in São Paulo, Brazil.

We would like to buy some paid-for-support to help me get it going?

Please let me know what sort of price I would have to pay.

Required skills:
Perl
wxPerl
Windows
MySQL
Video


Desired skills:
Linux
avi format files
