Job title:
Software Engineer (Linux/Apache/MySQL/Perl)

Company name: Hearst

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: commensurate with experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hearst Digital Media is looking for software developers to work on dynamic
content websites and e-commerce systems.  Our efforts are largely focused
on new development projects.

We strive to write clean object-oriented code and make judicious use of
CPAN.  We are open source friendly, both in terms of using and contributing
to open source. We have put a great deal of time architecting an efficient
and friendly development environment.

In addition to other engineers, you will interact with designers, editorial
and marketing staffers to build great online products for a variety of
websites. Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential.

We have positions located in our New York City (midtown) office.  Full time
telecommuting is currently not an option at this time.

Required skills:
Strong Perl development skills, significant experience working in a Unix
environment (preferably Linux), and some relational database (MySQL
preferred) experience are all an absolute must. Previous work with secure
servers and ecommerce systems is a plus . A working knowledge of HTML, XML,
and JavaScript is expected. Any experience with AJAX is also a plus.

Desired skills:
This is a software development position, however experience with mod_perl,
MySQL, and/or HTML::Mason is a big plus. Other things we'd find to be a
plus are experience with Apache configuration, Linux system administration,
and any database administration.
