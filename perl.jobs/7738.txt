Job title: Small order processing job

Company name: hiller paper

Location: United States, WA, Spokane

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a perl developer to create a script for us to help us in
upcoming ordering for our website. We are looking to use perl for this job
as it will quickly and effectively parse our orders. 


What we need the script to do is quantify each line in the order file to
see if the price for the product is correct.

So step by step what we are looking for from the perl script:

1. read in all orders in file order.csv
2. read in all prices for products in products.csv
3. compare all order line items, with the items cost in products.csv
4. omit all orders from problematic customers(problem_customers.csv)
5. export all orders that exceed product cost to file complete_orders.csv



An example of each file can be downloaded here:

http://w15.easy-share.com/1699699003.html(products.csv)
http://w13.easy-share.com/1699699022.html(complete_orders.csv)
http://w13.easy-share.com/1699699027.html(problem_customers.csv)

 Im sure this is a small job for a professional perl developer. We will pay
via paypal for this job. Please email me with any questions and bids. Thank
you for your time reading this.
