Job title:
Perl programmer for Open Source Support Company - Support/HelpDesk

Company name: ByWater Solutions

Location: United States, CA, Santa Barbara

Pay rate: ~5000/month USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are a small company that is based in Santa Barbara.	We are looking for
a perl programmer that would help man our support helpdesk.  We are working
on an Open Source project called Koha (it's for library automation - found
here -- http://koha-community.org ).  We are fine with someone working from
home but would ask that they could travel to Santa Barbara for 2~3 days a
week.  Ideally this person would be comfortable reading others code and
fixing bugs.  (We are small and growing - so this job does have potential
to grow into a development position beyond support needs at first)

Just a little bit about our company - http://bywatersolutions.com

Required skills:
LAMP
Perl
Apache 
MySQL

Desired skills:
Understanding the Library World (MARC records etc.)
