Job title: IT Operations Manager

Company name: Tunesat LLC

Location: New York, NY; Paris, France; or telecommute

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
A thriving startup founded by passionate musicians, Tunesat uses its
proprietary fingerprinting technology to track the use of millions of songs
on over 250 major TV stations in the US and Europe, and on the Web.
Today, Tunesat is hiring its IT Operations Manager: could it be you?

What the job is about

Your primary responsibility will be to ensure continuity of operations of
our platform (2 datacenters: New York and Paris), including audio
fingerprinting, TV feed capture, audio processing and storage, databases
and front-end (Web). As practical constrains evolve, you'll improve and
adapt our internal processes and suggest necessary improvements and
evolutions to our proprietary technologies.

Important: the job is to be performed in New York or Paris preferably, but
if you don't live in one of those cities and don't intend to relocate
there, it is possible to telecommute from anywhere in North America and
Europe.

Required skills:
Do you fit this picture?

You are a problem solver.
You have a strong autonomy and sense of responsibility.
You are obsessed with details and yet you keep the big picture in mind.
You are flexible and able to react quickly.
You want to own our platform as we want to own the space.

Technical requirements

You are fluent in Linux (Ubuntu) commands and all things shell and ssh.
You have a thorough SQL server experience, preferably PostgreSQL.
You are experienced in Perl and shell scripting, regular expressions and
data massaging.
You have a working knowledge of common network protocols (application
layer).
