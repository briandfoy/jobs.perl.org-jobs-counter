Job title: Perl developer - mason, Catalyst, DBI

Company name: IC Group

Location:
United States, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IC Group (www.pobox.com, www.listbox.com) needs a Perl programmer
experienced in building and maintaining database-backed web applications.

A lot of people trust us with sending and receiving their email, and we
want to make it easy for them to trust us (by being reliable) and easy for
them to use us (by having a great interface).

We're a small company that's been around since 1995.  We tend to be pretty
casual and try to work closely together without a lot of overhead.

We like open source; it runs our business.  As much as possible, we try to
write our code so that we can release it -- it's easier to write good code
when you know other people will see it.  Ask for our CPAN ids if you're
interested.

Feel free to sign up for a trial account of either service to see more
about what we do.

http://www.pobox.com -- lifetime email forwarding
http://www.listbox.com -- mailing lists

Required skills:
* Perl, specifically:
** HTML::Mason -- we use it for most web things
** DBI -- particularly an ORM (we've used Class::DBI, but any ORM
experience is useful)
** modular, object-oriented design
** a habit of writing automated tests
* experience with SQL generally and MySQL and/or PostgreSQL in particular
(both? even better)
* development on and comfort with unix (any is fine, we use linux and
solaris)

Desired skills:
* Catalyst -- we like it and want to use it more
* Email:: and Mail:: modules generally
* familiarity with high-volume web environments
* Javascript, especially using a framework or library 
(Dojo,	Prototype, etc.)
* refactoring ugly code into slightly less ugly code (everyone has
skeletons in their closet)
