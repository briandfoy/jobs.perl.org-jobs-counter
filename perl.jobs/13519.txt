Job title: Software Developer

Company name: The Idea Works, Inc.

Location: Columbia, MO

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Idea Works, Inc. of Columbia, MO is looking for an experienced software
developer to fill a full-time developer position.

Our flagship product is SAGrader ( https://www.sagrader.com ), which uses
automated grading and feedback of writing assignments to help students
learn their material without having to wait for an instructor’s feedback.
It’s based around our text analysis platform, which we've also put to work
in our other products.

We offer great health and dental insurance, an environment where you can
make a big impact on our products, and the opportunity to work on
interesting stuff as soon as you get here.

Required skills:
Our ideal candidate is self-motivated, a good communicator and has a few
years of experience building production web applications. You will use
modern Perl, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, CSS/LESS, Redis, Linux, Amazon Web
Services and a bunch of other technologies every day. We’d love a developer
who would be excited to work on our entire stack, from smooth UI features
to backend optimizations. Excellent software design and debugging skills
are required above expertise in any one technology.

Day to day you will:
 * Design and implement new features, taking input from users
 * Fix bugs and perform application maintenance
 * Have an active role in product and company meetings
 * Take part in the on call schedule, rotating with other developers
 * Participate in our ongoing research, building tools to help gather
interesting data
