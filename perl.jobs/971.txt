Description:
Did you know that Amazon.com has hundreds of software engineers and web
developers working on some of the most interesting technical challenges on
the planet?
Amazon.com, headquartered in beautiful Seattle, is looking for exceptional
software engineers and web developers to join its growing technology
organization.  Our technical team works on tough technical problems that
engage and stretch their brains.  As an engineer here, you might build
cutting edge product recommendation algorithms, scale and optimize our
world class supply chain systems, or architect and build an end-to-end
e-commerce platform that companies like Target and Toys R Us use to run
their online businesses.    
 
You’ll work with smart, experienced teammates on a small cross-functional
team.  You’ll join a scientific culture focused on achieving aggressive
goals.	And, you’ll work on creating a world-class customer experience for
the millions of people who use Amazon.com.   

Your Talents
We’re interested in smart, tenacious, results-oriented people who write
code and build systems to solve real business problems.  We want Senior
Software Developers with a deep proficiency in object oriented design and
development, experience building large-scale systems in C++ or Java on UNIX
or Linux, and algorithms expertise.  Our Web Developers need to have
experience with Perl/Mason to build software for the presentation layer, as
well as proficiency in usability/HCI, C/C++, Javascript, DHTML and Flash. A
Computer Science or Math degree and 7+ years’ experience are preferred for
both positions.
 
Why Seattle?
It’s a very livable, family-friendly city with so much to do on the
weekends!  The climate is mild and there are mountains and water all around
you.  You should see the view from our lunchroom! (By the way, we offer a
great relocation program to senior engineers.)	

We’ll be in the Bay Area to Interview Developers in August. If you’re
interested in talking with us while we’re in the Bay Area, email
kayk@amazon.com (put ‘BA’ in the subject line) with your resume, info on
the type of challenges you'd enjoy most, and your availability for an
in-person interview the week of August 18th.
