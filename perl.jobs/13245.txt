Description:
Ionzero seeks multiple candidates to join our team of talented perl

extending a future employment offer to the right contractor(s).   

We set out to create the kind of company we always wanted to work for,

We work in many languages (Perl, PHP, Java, whatever our customers need)
but right now we are looking for programmers with solid Perl and web
development experience.

Our clients and staff are all over the place, so you need to be able to
work well via email and our project management system. If this all sounds
good to you, send a resume along with sample code and your compensation
requirements.

Required skills:
•	Solid knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, both in utilizing
existing classes (including CPAN), as well as creating new modules from
scratch;
•	Complex Data Structures;
•	Perl
•	RDBMS (Mysql/Postgres)
•	Templating systems (Template::Toolkit a plus)
•	HTML/CSS/Javascript experience (jQuery a plus);
•	Excellent written/oral communication skills;

Desired skills:
•	Catalyst
•	Moose
•	Php
•	Node.js
•	Version Control (git/SVN)
