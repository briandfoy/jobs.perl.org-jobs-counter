Job title: Cloud Computing Software Developer

Company name: Forge Technologies, Inc.

Location: Rochester, NY, USA

Pay rate: DOE; see below

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Forge Technologies, Inc. seeks a LAMP developer to maintain and upgrade
Internet-based software (aka “Cloud Computing”).  The primary application
you will be developing is the Electronic Tenant Service Request system:
http://etsr3.com (use the "Test Drive" links).

The primary criterion for choosing a candidate will be cost effectiveness. 
(Amount of quality work done) / (wages).  However, we will not simply be
going with the lowest bid.  We will pay whatever it takes to hire someone
who will leave behind maintainable code.  If you do not take pride in
writing elegant, readable, maintainable code, please do not apply.

Longevity is another key. We would rather work with someone who has other
stuff going and and may occasionally put us on hold than someone who will
work with us for three months and move on to other opportunities.

Applicants must be able to do at least 25% of their work for us between
08:00 and 17:00 Eastern Time (13:00 and 22:00 GMT, give or take an hour for
DST).

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL
HTML
JavaScript
Linux

Desired skills:
Familiarity with standard Perl libraries
AJAX
Apache
CSS
Git
