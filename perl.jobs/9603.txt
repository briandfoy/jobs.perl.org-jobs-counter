Job title: Senior LAMP Developers

Company name: CoolerEmail

Location: United States, CA, San Diego

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
CoolerEmail is looking for Senior Perl Developers to join its LAMP
development team!  We are a well established company and have been in
business since 2000.

This is an <b>immediate opening</b> and will be filled quickly.

We are located in San Diego and while this is a telecommute position,
<b>preference will be given to local candidates</b> who can make it to
periodic meetings and other company functions.

You should have lots (5+ years) of recent experience writing large scale
object oriented Perl web applications.	Experience in other programming
languages is great, but this is a <b>Perl</b> position and thus it requires
extensive and recent <b>Perl</b> experience.

DBA (MySQL) and high volume data processing (think handling lots of bounced
email messages) are significant assets in this role.

Serious linux systems administration skills will get you hired tomorrow.

As this is a telecommute position you should be comfortable regulating your
schedule and working independently as well as collaboratively through
email, IM, phone (the horror!), etc.

Required skills:
* Object Oriented Perl (5+ years)
* Experience with MVC Frameworks
* Knowledge of DBI inside and out
* Familiarity with Perl ORMs (why they're good and why they're not)
* MySQL administration and design (if you've done this much Perl you must
have at least some MySQL DBA skills)
* HTML/CSS/Javascript (We know it's not fun, but these days, javascript is
indispensable.	We use jQuery to ease the pain)
* Excellent communication skills

Desired skills:
* Linux systems administration is a huge bonus
* UI Design
