Pay rate: $40-150K US

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Description:
We have a client looking for a Perl guru.  They are a financial company
that executes proprietary stock trading models to beat the market.  They
have been in business for 20 years.  The  software is a mishmash of open
source C/C++ on Linux and Perl/Python used to tie it all together.  They
would prefer a Perl developer with open source experience.  There are 76
people in the company and probably 50 are software engineers.  They custom
built a building around their business model.  It has the feel of a
library.  No cubes. Everyone has an individual office.	
 
The company pays very well.  They are at the beach.  Bonuses can and do
double your base salary. 
 
We have placed at least 10 or 15 developers with this firm, including the
person who will be the team lead for this new hire.  The company is the
kind of place a developer dreams of-challenging projects all the time, very
little bureacracy, surrounded by other passionate developers, good money
and benefits, and a very stable atmosphere. 
 
The bar is very high to get hired here.  The interviewing is rigorous.	Can
you cut the mustard?


Required skills:
Perl.  Exp with Parrot a plus.	Python is used as well.  C/C++ on Linux. 
Exp with a >10000 LOC Perl project.

Desired skills:
Uncommon level of passion for developing elegant software.  Ability to be
an independent developer completing projects for the group or work with
others.
