Job title:
Perl Web Application Developer for small co.

Company name: BookFinder.com

Location: United States, CA, Berkeley

Pay rate: $70-90k based on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're a stable, profitable, 4-person developer-driven company based in
Berkeley, CA. We offer the pay and stability of a larger company, but with
startup-style flexibility (low hierarchy, flexible hours, freedom to affect
product direction). We're located downtown, right next to the Downtown
Berkeley BART station.

Not surprisingly, we're a LAMP shop: Perl/CPAN, Apache, mod_perl, Mason,
MySQL, CVS, and Red Hat Linux / CentOS, etc. We're also powered by
whiteboards, shared brainstorming, and the love and support of a passionate
user base.

Responsibilities:

As one of the core developers of BookFinder.com, you will be involved with
all aspects of the system: product vision, development, debugging, and
maintenance. You'll have a hand in every part of the product lifecycle,
working alongside two long-time Perl coders in a friendly, low-hierarchy
workspace.

Code doesn't live in a vacuum; you'll need to be able to take into account
factors like analytics, marketing, and budgeting when making decisions
about the product. We're looking for someone self-motivated, and willing to
take responsibility for new ideas and initiatives.

Required skills:
-2+ years experience building large web-based applications in Perl
-Familiarity with standard Linux command line environment, tools, servers
(e.g. editors, source code control, Apache, etc.)
- Experience with data processing/analysis, regular expressions, and
Web-based APIs
- Ability to work in an environment with rapidly changing priorities
- Knowledge of HTML/CSS, some JavaScript


Desired skills:
- Database/SQL experience a plus
- Love of books and reading a plus
