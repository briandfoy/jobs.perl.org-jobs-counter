Job title: Website

Company name: Simplified Data Tracking

Location: Chicago IL

Pay rate: $90/hour

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 10-15 hours

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have 2 websites hosted by different hosting companies. One of them has
eCommerce and other functionality based on Perl scripts. I want to transfer
the other website from the current hosting company and have the same Perl
architecture as the first site. I have already redesigned the site but I
need somebody to make the eCommerce and other functionality (i.e. contact
us and support pages) Perl compatible. It is probably a few hours of work
for a good Perl programer. I would pay a minimum of $500 for the job if it
takes less than 5 hours.

Required skills: Website design and Perl programing
