Description:
Perl Developer Software Engineer
Looking for two Perl Developers to work for an exciting media client in
town, a detailed spec can be mailed but the Perl Developer would need
extensive experience working with Perl on large scale applications and be
able to write sophisticated components for Web applications using a mix of
Object Oriented code, Server APIs, and SQL queries.
If the software engineer had demonstrable competence in one or more
established Web framework technologies (eg Catalyst, Mason, TT, Zope,
Django, Spring, Tomcat or Maven2) this would be useful and any familiarity
with the Apache API, MYSQL, Database Interfaces and XML libraries would be
ideal but good Perl skills are the key.
