Job title: SUMMER INTERN: Perl hacker

Company name: Best Practical Solutions, LLC

Location: United States, MA, Somerville

Pay rate: USD 15-25/hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Summer (dates flexible)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Best Practical Solutions makes RT, the premiere open source issue tracking
system. To find out more about what we do, check out our website at
http://www.bestpractical.com. We're looking for a couple of summer interns
who can help us enhance RT and work an a couple of new s00per s3kkr1t
projects.


Required skills:
You should be a self-starter who has some experience with Perl, as well as
at least a few of the following:

    * Test driven development
    * HTML::Mason templating
    * SQL databases
    * Documentation
    * MVC frameworks
    * User interface design
    * Web Services
    * HTML
    * Cascading Style Sheets
    * Subversion and SVK


Desired skills:
We're based in Boston, but everyone telecommutes, so you should be
comfortable collaborating with others online.  It's ok if you don't know
everything out of the gate, but you should be able to learn on the fly and
be comfortable asking questions when you get in over your head.  RT is a
large codebase to dive into (47000 lines of libraries, 27000 of templates)
so you should be prepared to work with a project that's too big to hold in
your head at once.  If you want to see what sort of trouble you're getting
yourself into, download a copy of RT's source code from:

   http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt.tar.gz


URL for more information: http://bestpractical.com/

Contact information:
You'll be working full time all summer (though we're flexible about exact
dates.) Compensation depends on experience but is generally in the range of
$15-$25/hour. 

If spending the summer getting paid to hack on open source software sounds
like fun to you, drop us a line at resumes@bestpractical.com.

When you write, please include an informal cover letter telling us a bit
about who you are and what sorts of things you're interested in as well as
a code sample or two. In an ideal world, your code sample will include
documentation and tests, but if it doesn't just include a good sob story
about why it doesn't. We'd prefer to have your resume in plain text, but
will also accept PDFs or proprietary formats if you can't send a plain text
version.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a summer internship, not a salaried position.
