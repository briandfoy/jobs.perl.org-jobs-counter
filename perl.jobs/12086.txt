Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
About NetSuite:

Picture yourself building a successful career at NetSuite—working alongside
other talented, driven individuals to help fast-growing mid-size
organizations and larger enterprises achieve their business goals with the
world’s #1 cloud-based business management suite for ERP/financials, CRM,
ecommerce and more.

Founded in 1998 by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and NetSuite CTO and Chairman
Evan Goldberg,
NetSuite (NYSE: N) is used by more than 10,000 companies and subsidiaries
to run mission-critical operations without the high capital costs and
inefficiency of antiquated client/server systems. Named by Gartner as the
world’s fastest-growing financial management vendor and winner of a
prestigious 2011 CODiE award for Best Financial Management Solution,
NetSuite is where business is going. 

Summary:

Evolve often minimally-defined client business requirements into
professional quality NetSuite OpenAir solutions which satisfy not only that
client, but have the flexibility and customizability to be used by clients
with differing business processes and needs. These solutions may require
the conceptualization, design and implementation of a full-blown NetSuite
OpenAir Module, they may require evolving the system with architectural
extensions or they may dictate a minimal tweak to existing functionality. 

Fully scope out the impact of an implementation by considering all of the
necessary changes and any impact they may have on other parts of the
product.

Work in the NetSuite OpenAir development environment which is defined by
ASP deployment, a rapid release cycle and based on the “Extreme
Programming” software development discipline combined with the NetSuite
OpenAir operating principle of customer service orientation. This
environment mandates that bug fixes impacting clients take precedence over
both quick on-demand enhancements and longer term “planned” development
initiatives. It also means that quick on-demand enhancements often take
precedence over previously planned initiatives. The rapid release cycle
insures that features that are pushed out past a release date because of
this operating principle can be addressed in either the next scheduled
release or slip-streamed in the interim. This environment insures that we
have a high level of confidence in setting client expectations.  
	
Responsibilities:

•Act as a technical lead on a variety of projects to drive requirements all
the way through to implementation. Work closely with key stakeholders both
internally and externally as needed to deliver solutions in a timely
manner.

•Work closely with management to identify issues, and solutions
proactively.

•Educate peers and staff with regards to the application as well as new
technologies that may help drive the product forward or promote
efficiencies

•Stay abreast of new technologies and trends that may impact the product or
company and share these with your peers.

•Assist management in cross training existing and new staff so that we can
expand the engineering department and provide growth opportunities for all
engineering staff. 

•Design and develop technical high quality solutions that promote code. 

•Work closely with other members of the NetSuite OpenAir engineering team
to look for opportunities to tune the NetSuite OpenAir architecture,
product, and infrastructure to further increase system reliability and
performance.

•Work with large enterprise clients and their technical staff to isolate,
diagnose, and resolve performance issues specific to their use of this
business workflow product.

•Work in the NetSuite OpenAir development environment which is defined by
ASP deployment, a rapid release cycle and based on the “Extreme
Programming” software development discipline combined with the NS OA
operating principle of customer service orientation.

•Fully scope out the impact of an implementation by considering all of the
necessary changes and any impact they may have on other parts of the
product.
