Job title: Consultant: Linux/Apache/Perl/PHP

Company name: Follett Library Resources

Location: United States, IL, McHenry

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Roughly a week

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We need a hotshot internals whiz to fix a segfaulting Apache.  Three of us
on my team have spent the past two weeks trying to find this insidious
problem, and need you to be a set of fresh eyes.  Show off your
core-reading, valgrinding, Apache-fu chops.  Work with us to find the
problem, solve it, and then use the rest of the week making sure it's
actually fixed, and that it doesn't reoccur under load, so we can roll out
our project.

This is not simply a matter of "Can't You Just read the core dump?" 
Reproducibility is limited, and we've hit a couple of red herrings that we
thought were The Problem.

Required skills:
You need to be well versed in: Linux, Apache, mod_perl and PHP.  As asides,
we're also using gd, GD, Chart::*, XMLRPC under PHP, and using Oracle as a
database backend.

Most of all, you need to work with me and my team, onsite in McHenry, IL,
to find the problem.  We'll fill you in on what we know so far, and then
we'll get down to finding the problem.

Contact information:
Email me at andy@petdance.com (my home account).  Please sell me on why you
are the hotshot we want to come in and pull us out of this mess.  Include
your rates and any other details.  We'd prefer to have someone local to the
Chicago area so we don't have to fly you in and put you up, but if that's
what we need to do, we will.
