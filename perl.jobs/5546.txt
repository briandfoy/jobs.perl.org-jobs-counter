Description:
My client are a world-leading encryption and cryptography technology firm,
developing solutions in Authentication, PKI, SSL, HSM and cryptography.  

This particular client have a track-record and background in hiring the
best engineers in the UK - their UK workforce is revered, and academics
taken seriously.

I'm looking for someone to join this company's QA team.  This is "proper"
QA - not button pushing or web testing!  You'll play a key role in
generating test plans and cases, and most importantly, you'll run manual
test scripts using Perl or Python.

This is an opportunity to join a genuine world-leader in a massive growth
industry.

Required skills:
- Ideally, you'll have a strong academic pedigree
- You'll have exposure to Perl or Python
- You'll (maybe) have some test/QA experience, or at least a "test
mindset".

That's about it :-)
