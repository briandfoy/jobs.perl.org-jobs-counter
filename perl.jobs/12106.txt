About Polyvore Engineering

Each month, Polyvore.com has 13 million unique visitors, 200 million

Our software engineers develop platforms and tools that harness the
creativity of our user community, empowering expression and enabling
distribution of their user generated content. We hire software engineers
with a broad set of skills who are ready to build, scale, and make a
continual impact. We have a philosophy of doing a few things really well-
allowing you to own your piece of the company strategy. We constantly try

and improving products that have millions of users. You’re a hacker with
pristine code. You’re a creative force, excited and ready to tackle

input into the product direction.

skills should include familiarity with authentication standards such as
OAuth, APIs like Facebook and Twitter, and blogging platforms like Tumblr
and Blogger. You’ll be creating software at all levels of the development
stack, from front-end interfaces to back-end analytics.
