Description:
Senior Perl/SQL/Linux/Web Developer

This is an excellent opportunity for a developer to join our tight-knit
team and to be part of our innovative ground-breaking company, founder of
the UK Internet press cuttings and news aggregation industry. 

About the Company

A leading provider of Internet press cuttings and real-time aggregated
news, NewsNow is a 'dot com' survivor that owes its success to a
combination of sophisticated home-made technology and a tight team of
professionals who give first-class customer service.

Started in 1997, NewsNow's services include NewsNow.co.uk, a winner of the
UK's Website of the  Year Awards 2006. NewsNow is continually "pushing the
envelope" as we look for new ways to make the wealth of online news a more
manageable and cost-effective experience for our clients and 1.1m website
users.

About the Role 

This challenging hands-on role comprises taking part in the team's design
decisions and implementing new functionality within our award-winning
consumer portal, our corporate subscription services and our custom-built
internal tools. Key design decisions will commonly be made in conjunction
with other team members and development and testing will be both autonomous
and 'extreme'. You will share system administration responsibilities and
'on call' duties with the rest of the team.

If you are a productive, fast thinking individual who is aware of the
trade-offs between various design decisions and is able to communicate your
thinking both within your team and to non-technical staff, prospects and
clients, then please contact us on +44 (0)20 7471 0400 or email
