Description:
Be Part of Something Great!

The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley, CA has a challenging
opportunity available for an energetic and productive Software Developer.
The scope of work will include developing software for small phases of data
analysis and organization within the larger Human Microbiome Project (HMP)
conducted under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health. During
the HMP, DNA sequence data from the genomes of bacteria and other microbes
are collected at various institutes throughout the country. Data will
arrive at LBNL and must be organized, processed, and inserted into
databases. End users will interact with the data using a web application
modeled loosely upon Greengenes (http://greengenes.lbl.gov).

Candidate will be involved in the design, configuration, implementation,
operation, and maintenance of computational systems including relational
database management systems, application systems, and APIs.

Data Management - Develop, implement, and administer mySQL RDBMS for the
validation, storage, and retrieval of DNA sequence data and associated
metadata. Analyze and define data requirements and specifications. Modify,
and manage databases, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of data tables
using primary and foreign keys. Draft, edit and maintain data flow
diagrams.

Software and Web Development - Develop, modify, and implement new or
existing PERL software solutions to organize and search DNA sequence data.
Write code, validate data acquisition and output formats, define web
browser interface requirements and design these interfaces using HTML,
JavaScript, YUI, and AJAX. Contribute code for publicly viewable dynamic
websites using the Catalyst web framework. Work with remote and local users
via face-to-face meetings, conference calls and email to test and debug
applications, assure software quality and functionality. Write and maintain
program documentation including formal manuscripts for peer review and
deployable PERL modules. Develop PERL utility programs as needed, install
new or modified software/modules releases and updates (mainly via CPAN).
Track all changes within code base using Subversion. Monitor web site
functionality and integrity. Troubleshoot problems and collect and analyze
web site statistics.


Required skills:
B.S. degree, or equivalent experience, in Computer Science, or a
computer-related discipline, and at least one year of relevant experience
(may have been concurrent with education).
Proficient in PERL, HTML.
Knowledge and experience with database design and use, familiar with SQL.
Proven experience in developing dependable software. Able to provide sample
source code for review.
Knowledge with UNIX/Linux shell.
Effective verbal and written English communication skills.
Strong analytical, organizational, and interpersonal skills including:
excellent problem solving, planning, prioritizing, sound judgment and
flexibility.

Desired skills:
Familiar with creating CPAN modules.
Familiar with open-source biological software ( e.g., BioPERL).
Familiar with parallel programming (forks, SGE, BOINK, etc). 
Familiar with web programming (Apache, CGI, Catalyst, JavaScript, YUI, and
AJAX).
CRUD framework experience is a plus.
Familiar with source code control tools, e.g. CVS or Subversion.
Understanding and experience working with DNA sequence analysis, including
alignment and assembly.
Additional experience with Biological Sciences is a plus including
Molecular Biology, Microbiology and Ecology.
