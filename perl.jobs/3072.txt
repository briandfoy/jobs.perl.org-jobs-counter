Job title: Perl-centric web app developer

Company name: Follett Library Resources

Location: United States, IL, McHenry

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you're looking for a great job with a great company in a great industry,
where you can get roots and have fun doing it, come work for the Web
Development department at Follett Library Resources in McHenry, IL.

Here are ten reasons to come work with us:

1) We write mostly in Perl, the most fun you can have writing code.

2) We lack political BS. There's hierarchy, but we're all technical peers. 
If there's a way to improve things, then we want to hear it, even if it's
the boss's code.

3) Automated testing is crucial.  It makes it harder to screw up
accidentially.

4) The company's mission statement talks about "lifelong learning," and we
take that seriously.  You'll learn as you go, and help teach the rest of us
as well.

5) You won't be bored.	We've got two years of projects awaiting us.  The
projects we work on constantly amaze and astound our customers.

6) We're not a sweatshop.  We look at project schedules realistically. 
There's no "Do this 6-month project in 3 weeks" nonsense.  We estimate our
own projects, rather than having them handed to us.

7) We are immersed in Open Source.  Linux, Apache, Perl, CPAN, mod_perl,
Template Toolkit, vim and Subversion are all our tools we use daily.  (Ok,
we do use Oracle for our heavy database work.)

8) We're more like a football team than a golf foursome.  Everyone works
with, relies on, and supports everyone else.

9) TITLEWAVE is of vital importance to the future of the company.  It's a
key differentiator in our marketplace.	This is code that helps make us
profitable, not just Yet Another Accounting System.

10) We enjoy coming to work in the morning.  Our work is enjoyable, and we
work in an important industry.	We go home at the end of the day knowing
that we help get books in the hands of kids.


Required skills:
2+ years of application programming experience, with web applications a big
plus.  You must be well-versed in object-oriented design and coding,
experienced in writing applications, know HTML and SQL, and be proficient
using shell-based Linux/Unix as a development platform.  Excellent
written/verbal communication is a must.  Most important, you must be a good
fit with our team.
