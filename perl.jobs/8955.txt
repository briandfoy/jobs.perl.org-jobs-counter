when needed
- Ability to meet deadlines as required (even short ones)
- Strong attention to detail
- Experience with a major framework (Struts, CodeIgniter, Rails)
- Experience with the Model-View-Controller paradigm (we use Catalyst)

Additional Skills include a good understanding of object oriented design
and concepts, must like working in a dynamic environment with rapidly
changing requirements, excellent interpersonal skills, understand the
software life-cycle, experience in testing and test organization and
planning is a plus.  Track record of taking ownership of a project
preferred.
