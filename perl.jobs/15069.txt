Job title: Experienced Perl developer/educator.

Company name: Edument AB

Location: Malmö, Sweden

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
We know what people say about Perl. In all likelihood, you've heard it too.
We believe Perl has a kind of freedom and flexibility that's relatively
unmatched in other languages. We think that such freedom and flexibility
can lead to messy code, but in the right hands it can also lead to awesome
code. If that sounds like your hands, we're looking for you.

Edument is a
high-quality consulting, mentoring and training company based in the south
of Sweden. We focus on solving the deep and challenging problems that our
clients face, often drawing on ideas and experiences from agile,
Test-driven development, Domain-driven design, CQRS, and languages other
than Perl. Many of us are active in development communities, participating
in open source projects and speaking at workshops, user groups and
conferences.

If you want to work on exciting problems with interesting
people, Edument would like to hear from you.

Desired skills:
* Modern Perl
* Familiarity with CPAN

* Test-driven development
*
Domain-driven design
