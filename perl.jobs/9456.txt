Job title:
Assistant Perl developer for travel company

Company name: Skoosh

Internal ID: 02

Location: United Kingdom, East Sussex, Brighton

Pay rate: 3000 USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Skoosh has been established for 8 years and is a fast growing B2C site for
booking hotel accommodation. 

We compete head to head with the biggest players in our industry. This is a
particularly exciting time as our brand is beginning to flourish.

We require two more developers for an ongoing project to extend our current
software. As our existing team is based in Russia, our preference would be
for more Russian developers but surrounding countries would also be
considered.


Required skills:
Successful applicants should have experience in building and extending
large web applications written in Perl as well as having advanced level
knowledge of English, MySQL and Javascript. Experience of working with XML
integrations is also required and a knowledge of the travel industry would
be an advantage.

Training on our system can take 2-3 months so any applicants should be
prepared to work for a year or longer.
