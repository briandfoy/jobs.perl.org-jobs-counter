Our client is looking for candidates that are excited about developing
Perl applications.  If Perl is a your primary focus (and not a "foot in
the door" to do development with other tools like Java), our client's
position could be a good match with your talents.

The client is looking for candidates who are willing to transition to
being permanent employees after a period of 6+ months as contractors.
We support this transition 100%.

Ideal candidates will have at least two years of experience in Perl,
HTML, and JavaScript (Perl is most  important).  OO development
experience is a big plus.

Equally important, we are looking for candidates that will be a good fit
for our client and vice versa.  The environment is a very, very large
Unix installation, where Perl is at the core of many of their systems.
The environment is one where team play is essential, along with very,
very strong technical skills.  The client culture is one that is very
employee-focused.  Benefits are well above average, and there is very
little turnover.  The client is large, financially stable and
established.  This is as far from a start-up environment as one could
possibly be, while still having access to the latest Unix-centric
technologies to keep one's skills sharp.  There is excellent career path
potential into higher level technical and management roles.
