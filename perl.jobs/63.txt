Programmer/ Systems Administrator/ Project Manager available

I have broad experience of Unix based systems, web site production and
programming.  I have experience of managing Unix clusters of mixed AIX,
HPUX, Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD and Irix machines.  I am familiar with
unix a-z: apache, bind, cron, dump, ETRN, fsck, grep, head, ifconfig,
job, kill, last, mkdir, named, openssl, passwd, queso, rcs, syslog,
tcpdump, uptime, vi, wc, xntpd, yes and zmore are not strangers to me.
I have managed a busy, content rich web site and mass virtual hosting
for hundreds of clients.  My preferred programming language is perl.
I have 8 years experience of perl programming and I am familar with most=20
perl techniques. I can also use Java, C, shell on Unix platforms.

I live in Devon, England and a permanent, challenging role in the
south west would be great.   Short term contracts further afield are
also welcome.  I have my own development environment and can telework
from home if desired.

Please contact me at jamie@linuxufo.org for a copy of CV
