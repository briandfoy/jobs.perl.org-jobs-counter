Job title: Web Application Developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C30

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: $45K - $70K DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. is a young and growing (but also financially stable)
company, and we need to hire great software developers to help us grow. 
Our software enables market researchers to deploy complex online surveys,
and view results using real-time on-line reports.  We license our software
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we also have client
service project managers who use our software internally for clients who
who would rather outsource all survey set up.  

We are currently adding major new features to our software to allow us to
stay ahead of the competition. So this is a great opportunity for the right
candidate to be a part of building leading-edge software using the latest
web development technologies.  You will be involved in all phases of
software development, from high level design, detailed design, to
programming, testing, and roll-out.

Our programming is done using database-backed and object-oriented
programming, with tools such as Perl on the server and using JavaScript
(with the YUI library and Ajax) for the front-end.

Depending on your background and experience, you may also be responsible
for helping to monitor and manage our servers, and for occasionally
providing technical support to our clients.


Required skills:
Our core software is built using Perl, mod_perl, DBI, and Apache running on
Linux servers, with Javascript modules and ajax to provide dynamic
scripting and web 2.0 technologies on front-end. So our ideal candidate
will be experienced in these tools. 

More important, however, is a good foundation in overall programming
skills, and the ability to learn and apply new skills quickly. Furthermore,
because the position will involve significant design work and because new
features evolve quickly, we need someone who can take the initiative to
figure out what needs to be done, and then make it happen.

Desired skills:
The following additional skills are desirable:

* Ability to set up hardware (for example, installing all necessary
software on a new Linux server) and some level of networking expertise.
* The ability to understand our business and suggest ways to leverage our
current technology.

Finally, because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked
to wear different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to
help the company grow and prosper.
