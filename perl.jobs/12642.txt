Job title: Full time Perl developer in Chicago

Company name: Simply Studio / Suite Setup

Location: Chicago, Illinois

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're building the next generation platform for small business owners to
run their business on, and looking for amazing Perl developers to join our
team. We currently have over 5,000 active users already, and working hard
to grow rapidly the coming years.

We use Amazon EC2 for our hosting, and Perl and MySQL for our back end. If
you match the following qualifications, drop us a line and tell us about
yourself and why you make a great addition  to our team.

Required skills:
- You know what it takes to build an entire web application, not just the
back end

- A minimum of 3 years of actual Perl experience. Modules contributed to
CPAN would be a big plus.

- You have working knowledge of the following modules:
-- CGI::App or Catalyst
-- Plack
-- DBIx::Class
-- Moose

- Good to excellent Javascript skills

- Experience with jQuery

- Very good to excellent Linux administration skills including Apache and
MySQL

Desired skills:
- We're a start-up so it is essential you can work on your own and figure
what needs to be done next. At the same time, we're a team and we want you
to be part of that so the ability to communicate and ask when a task is not
clear is critically important as well.

- You take pride in writing good code that can ship rather than working
hard to produce perfect code that never ships.
