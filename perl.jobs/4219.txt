Required skills:
* Ability to quickly read and understand pre-existing Perl code, written in
a wide variety of styles.

* Strong experience working with Template::Toolkit
* Willingness to code User Interfaces via Template::Toolkit (no, we don't
expect you to be a graphics artist, but basic HTML skills would be nice)
* Strong knowledge of common ISP technical terms/protocols (CIDR, TCP/IP,
SNMP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)
* Some experience with mod_perl, or at least a willingness and ability to
learn quickly.
* Understanding of CVS
* Ability to work with other developers on the same project
* Able to code well-defined projects quickly and efficiently, as well as
offer useful input during the design and specification process
* A strong sense of humor!

Desired skills:
* Basic HTML/CSS skills (enough to get the idea across to a designer to
fill in later!)
* Basic Javascript/AJAX skills (used rarely, but neccessary for some UI
widgets)
* Experience with DBI/MySQL
* Basic understanding of PHP - not required, but could prove helpful
* Basic understanding with common billing system terminology/logic and how
it relates to both business and technical logic
* Basic sys-admin skills as relating to a hosting shop (Apache, Bind,
Qmail, etc.) - No, we're not hiring a sysadmin, but some of your tasks will
me making their lives easier!
