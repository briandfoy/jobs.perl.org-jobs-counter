hi all,

it is time to do another round of success stories. if you ever landed a
job or filled a position, email me or the discuss list and saya few
sentences about what happened. we want to add this as a new page on the
jobs.perl.org site.

let us know if we can quote you on that page.

i know the last time, i heard of about a dozen or more matches and that
was over a year ago.

thanx,

uri
