Job title:
Perl Developer, using modern Perl 5 and experiment with Perl 6

Company name: OpusVL

Location: Rugby, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Join our Perl development team in Rugby to develop and maintain customer
projects. We use modern Perl 5 and experimenting with Perl 6.

At OpusVL we
develop open source ERP applications for businesses who aspire to lead
their industries, but find that their software needs are not met by "off
the shelf" tools or applications. Working collaboratively with them, we
design a solution that fits. We then take ownership of project delivery
through development, testing, deployment and support.

Our customers value
a professional approach to software development, and trust us to make
technology decisions on their behalf.

We are now looking for a Perl
developer to join our development team in Rugby.

We'd expect you to
understand object oriented programming and design, be comfortable with test
driven development, and have experience of developing with a "Modern Perl"
stack.

You will be working on a mixture of new projects and maintenance of
existing code. As part of the role, you will also take ownership and lead
the development of Flexibase, our open source application framework used in
all of our Perl projects.

We operate test-driven development, code to
proper specifications, and keep up to date with technology. Developers are
the most important part of our business - without a great technical
delivery team, we would not be able to handle the complex and varied
challenges; with the right people we know that if it is possible, we can
make it happen.

Desired skills:
=E2=80=A2 Experienced in modern Perl development techniques, including;
    =E2=80=A2
Object system (e.g. Moose)
    =E2=80=A2 ORM (e.g. DBIx::Class)
    =E2=80=A2 Web framework
(e.g Catalyst, Dancer2, Mojolicious)
    =E2=80=A2 Test::More (or other Perl
testing modules)
=E2=80=A2 Ability to maintain platform used for multiple products
across multiple domains and sectors
=E2=80=A2 Structured and organised
=E2=80=A2 Ability to
write technical and user documentation
=E2=80=A2 Technical communications through
multiple channels (in person, phone, instant messaging, issue trackers)
=E2=80=A2
Team working with other developers
=E2=80=A2 Eager to learn new skills and
technologies
=E2=80=A2 Able to create secure and maintainable code
=E2=80=A2 Managing
source control
=E2=80=A2 Test driven development

Beneficial skills

=E2=80=A2 Ability to
own the Flexibase vision and roadmap
=E2=80=A2 Deployment using Docker
=E2=80=A2
Dist::Zilla
=E2=80=A2 PostgreSQL
=E2=80=A2 Experience with continuous integration tools
=E2=80=A2
Perl 6

It would be ideal if you could give us some examples of software
you've developed, such as any open source contributions, videos or on-line
documentation you've made, or your GitHub profile; as part of a team, it's
very important that your code and documentation is easy for others to read
and extend.

Working at OpusVL

At OpusVL we strive to provide a relaxed,
highly supportive working environment.

We understand that to be creative
and provide high quality code, our developers need to build a comfortable
environment that suits them individually and the company supports this as
much as possible. All developers get dual-head workstations (running Mint,
Ubuntu and other Linux flavours) as standard, with a budget for peripherals
of your choice.

We'll support your training and development, and give you
paid time to attend conferences and other events relevant to your role.

The OpusVL office is in a convenient central UK location right in the heart
of Rugby, about two minutes walk from the shops, cafes and coffee shops.
There's no dress code for technical people and working conditions are
flexible.

So if you want to make a difference, and support Open Source
while working on interesting projects then we'd love to hear from you!
