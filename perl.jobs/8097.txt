unique issues of process, scale, and complexity. If you like working on
tough problems in scaling systems and process that you won't see anywhere
else, then the DevTools team is the place to be. 

The current need is for a good, systems-oriented engineer to work on
virtualization. Yahoo is expanding our use of virtualization to better
utilize our resources, and our group is going to lead that charge.We're
looking for a self-directed mid-level engineer with strong scripting skills

(linux, freeBSD), and experience with a virtualization product (VMware,
Xen). Most importantly, we want someone to join the team who wants to take
on and solve difficult problems.
