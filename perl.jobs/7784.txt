Description:
With more than 600 offices in 33 countries, the infrastructure Engineering
function operates in a global team with the primary objective to design,
engineer and integrate robust scalable solutions. The successful candidate
will have a proven history of engineering / integrating 3rd party
technologies into an enterprise environment. To maximise team collaboration
we are seeking a thought leader responsible for implementing the next
generation of data protection and storage technologies. 

Examples of some of the PERL work performed by the team 

Developed a software infrastructure for deploying a WysDM reporting
product. The main challenges of the project were creating automatic update
of the WysDM configuration, adding change control and simplifying report
creation. Used OOP as well as XML::LibXML. To simplify the administrator’s
access to thousands of reports I developed a web portal. As a pilot
implementation it was initially built with Ruby on Rail. However due to the
performance and integration problems it was redesigned with Perl Catalyst
framework. I used DBIx::Class for  models and TT for views.   
Developed a framework for adding change control to the NetBackup AutoSys
infrastructure. The idea was to have a central configuration repository for
all NetBackup related autosys jobs on hundreds of servers. 
Developed several OOP modules for existing NBUconf framework. It is used
for checking and updating NetBackup settings on hundreds of NetBackup
servers. 


Required skills:
The ideal candidate will be an experienced PERL scripter to develop the
next generation of products, a thorough understanding of Unix to solid
system administration level (Solaris or Linux) and possess indepth
experience of integrating 3rd party technologies into an enterprise
environment . Strong communication skills and a sense of global ownership
are required. High levels of motivation, initiative and a proactive or
'self starting' approach to work is essential.
