Job title: Perl/CGI/DBI Programmer work at home

Company name: Clearbuilt Technologies, Inc.

Location: United States, GA, Telecommute

Pay rate: $40-$50/hour DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 month project

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Our immediate needs are for two short-term programmers for a fast
turnaround web-based project that will begin in the middle of November and
end late December.  The programmers who work on this project (and some who
don't, probably) will be considered for future contract work, of which
there is likely to be a lot in the coming year.  Ideally the initial
project will result in a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.

Clearbuilt has been developing and hosting custom web applications since
1994.  We are looking to establish a few relationships with contractors for
coding.  In general, we will work with our clients to gather project
requirements, specify a design, and then divide the development into
several tasks to be performed by outsourced contracts.	


Required skills:
Very strong Perl and CGI skills are needed. Familiarity with DBI is also
required. Must be able to work with complex Perl data structures, including
multi-level references and objects. Must be very comfortable working in
Unix/Linux environment. Fast turnaround is needed, so you need to be
available at least 20-30 hours per week -- more is better.  Ability to pick
up complex projects quickly is required.


Desired skills:
XHTML, CSS, and for future work, PHP and Java Applets would be a plus.
