Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Adzuna

Location: London, SW6 (not remotely)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are looking for an experienced Perl developer to support the ongoing
development and rapid growth of the Adzuna job search engine. This is a
great opportunity to join a fast-growing, blue-chip startup.

As a key
member of our small but experienced team, you will work on a Solr powered
frontend website, with a Gearman-powered, distributed backend aggregating
job ads from across the web, crunching job market data and applying machine
learning algorithms to enhance job seekers’ experience.

You will need to
thrive on working independently in a fast-moving, low-structure
environment. You will have the chance to help shape our technical direction
and processes as we grow. An appreciation of the ‘devops’ movement is
essential as we manage and monitor the systems ourselves. You will also
need to understand the importance of building structured code that is fast,
scalable, reliable and robust.
The projects you will work on will include
new search features, relevancy and matching algorithms, APIs and ‘big data’
analysis, reporting tools and features to enhance the job search experience
on Adzuna. Our systems have been built to scale, and you will be able to
demonstrate your experience in writing scalable code running in distributed
environments.

You will:

- need to possess a solid understanding of
application data flow and ability to partner with other engineers and data
scientists to improve existing systems and develop new functionality and
tools

- analyse business and technical requirement and develop solutions,
taking into account variable aspects, such as performance, scalability,
ease of maintenance.

- help refactor existing processes and workflows to
improve availability and performance

- participate in R&D of new
technology trends and tools
assist and mentor members of our development
team
