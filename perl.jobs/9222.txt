Description:
My Client is looking for a Senior Perl Engineer to work with a complete set
of product requirements (this has already been produced by a non technical
manager) from the requirements you will generate software, system design
and carry out the implementation. 

You will have the assistance of a in-house Technical team but you will
carry out the bulk of the design and coding, depending on the design this
project will involve formal mathematical methods and may involve "cloud" or
grid technologies like Amazon EC2 or similar. 

This will be a opportunity to build a complete, re-usable technology
component that will be deployed in many different contexts, the plan for
this system will require a solution that can be scaled up easily as it is
applied to larger and larger problem sets and narrow the runtime
requirement from days down to hours.

Required skills:
Essential Skills 
* Strong experience of writing software in Perl for UNIX-like operating
systems. 
* Experience of designing large Object Oriented (OO) software libraries.
* Experience of coding using formal mathematics, Bioinformatics or Genome
algorithms.
* Experience of working with distributed systems and large scale data sets.

* Experience of writing test cases and unit testing.

Desired skills:

* Knowledge of data-warehouse systems, Amazon EC2 and distributed
computing.
