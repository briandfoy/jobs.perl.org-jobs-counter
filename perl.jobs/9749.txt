Description:
Nextrials has an immediate opening for a highly-skilled, enthusiastic,
creative, senior software engineer to join our small, geographically
dispersed, highly-productive Agile team in a successful San Francisco Bay
Area software company.	Our award-winning, flagship application, Prism, is
an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) web application for managing clinical
research data.	Prism is a robust, full-featured, modular, object-oriented,
mod_perl application running on Linux against a PostgreSQL database, with
heavy use of XML technologies including XSLT, XPath and XQuery.  Newer
tools are typically written in some combination of Java, a dynamic
language, or Flex.  You will contribute to improvements to Prism and our
suite of tools, including scalability and performance improvements as well
as new functionality.  The right candidate is not married to a particular
language or technology, but is open-minded, uses the best tools for the job
and has experience working with heterogeneous technologies. This position
is a full-time telecommute position with 10-15% travel, mostly to the San
Francisco Bay Area.  Applicants must be located in North America.  For
details on our company and product, see our website at
http://www.nextrials.com.

Required skills:
Skills and experience you must have: at least 5 years working as a
professional developer in a collaborative team environment; experience
building multi-tiered web applications; fluency in one or more
object-oriented programming languages, including object-oriented Perl;
relational database management experience (PostgreSQL preferred); knowledge
of Web 2.0 technologies; proficiency writing object-oriented JavaScript;
strong XML experience (DOM, Schema, XPath, XQuery, XSLT); enthusiasm, the
ability to learn quickly, and an open mind.

Desired skills:
Skills and experience that would be nice to have, but are not required:
experience with enterprise architecture design; Java; Flex; HTML::Mason,
test-driven development and unit testing; experience improving scalability
and performance of web applications; experience working in an Agile Scrum
environment, especially with a dispersed team; knowledge of the EDC or
eHealth spaces, including CDISC and HL7 standards.
