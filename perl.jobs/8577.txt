Job title:
eCommerce Developer - Full Time *** Telecommute *** 

Company name: YourSolutions.net, LLC

Location: United States, Utah

Pay rate: $36-$60 USD/yr DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Description:
Web / GUI Heavy web application PERL developer who is strong in Front end
Web Technologies: Ajax, xHTML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript who has a nice set of
websites they can show.

Someone who is able to read others code well, we have a large ecommerce web
application so understanding payment gateways, shopping cart flow and
procedures, customer experience through an ordering process, generating
awesome graphs and reports, data mining, beautiful/sophisticated query
forms with beautiful/sophisticated reporting of data so client can stay on
top of their business growth.

This position is permanent / full time and it is a Telecommuting position.
So, you must have a conducive work environment where you won’t be
distracted. Occasional travel may be required. Salary is based on
experience and clearly demonstrated abilities: $48,000 - $60,000+ / year.
Age, race, gender and orientation are irrelevant and we couldn’t care less
that you come from Jupiter and don't play xBox/PC games and that you drink
water through your ear. Please be prepared to provide 3 references for
which you contributed solid work.

We are an 11 year old company with over 300 active clients.  We have a
growing client base that needs your skills and wise assistance. Our team is
small but committed. We are realistic yet optimistic and want team members
who can get excited about a collective vision. We are interested in good
ideas, projects, and concepts that make our product and company better. 
Your creativity and desire to contribute is key.

We aren't interested in applicants who:
• know ASP/Cobal/C++ but will learn Perl on the job
• expect six weeks paid holiday 
• think they would like to try working from home, but who have never done
it.

We are big on family… and we like to play outdoors: fish, ATV, river raft,
4x4, hike, boulder… we read tech and business magazines, play with cool new
electronic gadgets and discuss politics and religion as it pertains to XBox
/ Wii / Playstation and Apple/PC games. We also like weekends to be
weekends, when we get the chance. 

We love family and kids (CEO has 5 children at home and for over a decade
telecommuted, so he understands being with family)... but we realize they
are huge distractions for the new telecommuter... 

So, unfortunately, those who recently have small children and want to stay
home to see them grow up because they think they can manage both - BUT who
have never tried telecommuting and managing a young family at the same
time... or those with wives who really don't want them around all that
much... sorry... you need not apply.

have a conducive work environment where you won’t be distracted.
