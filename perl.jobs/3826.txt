Job title: Mike Anderson

Company name: Arguedas, Cassman & Headley

Location: United States, CA, Berkeley

Pay rate: Flat fee

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: As long as necessary

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Can someone out there write me a little Perl script? It'd be a dead 
simple program, and I can pay you for your time and trouble. 

Basically all it has to do is look at the contents of a directory, and 
output a text file whose exact contents would depend on the names and 
numbers of files in that directory. Bonus points if it can do this for 
multiple subdirectories in a directory. I'll give you the specs for the 
file if you want to see it before taking on the job. 

This would be done on a Windows PC (I'd be working from DOS I suppose.) 

Anyone? This would probably take 10 minutes for a decent programmer to 
write, I imagine, but I'll pay $50, or whatever it's worth to you, 
within reasonable limits depending on how hard it is to do. 

Thanks, 
Mike
