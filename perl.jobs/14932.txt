Job title: Senior Software Engineer in Test

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA

Pay rate: Range starts at $100k USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
MaxMind is looking for a talented, experienced, and highly motivated Senior
Software Engineer in Test to help us develop and improve our products,
websites, and customer portal.

*The Position*
Your job will be to work with our QA team, developers, and product
management to test changes to existing products, as well as test new
products to ensure they behave as expected. You will also liaise with our
support team so that you are aware of problems being reported by users. You
will work with developers to triage these bug reports and make sure they
are fixed in future releases.

Things that need testing at MaxMind include our website, our web services,
our downloadable databases, client APIs, and more. Your job is to break
them all and then help us rebuild them.

We're looking for a detail-oriented person with strong development and
communication skills. Whenever possible, we expect you to automate tests
using tools like Selenium,TeamCity, virtual machines, etc. When manual
testing is needed, you will need to document your test plans for future
use. We have great unit tests, and recently developed the infrastructure
for integration tests, but we would greatly benefit from improved
functional testing.

Our development team is largely comprised of telecommuters, so
communication centers around Google Hangouts, group chat, and agile
planning tools. Full-time telecommuting is permitted, and we invite
candidates from most US states and Canada; we cannot hire telecommuters
from NJ, NY, PA, TX, WA, or outside the US or Canada. We may give
preference to those candidates who are near Waltham, Massachusetts or
Vancouver, British Columbia.

The salary range for this position starts at $100k/year and is negotiable
depending on experience. Employees additionally participate in a
performance-based bonus plan.

*About MaxMind*
As an employee of MaxMind, you'll enjoy the flexibility and autonomy that
come with being a member of a small technical team. We're a casual,
friendly, results-focused company of about 25 employees. We want you to get
things done, but it's also important to have a life outside the office.

Our main office is located near downtown Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, a
five minute walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express
bus lines.

In addition to medical, dental, and vision coverage, we offer several other
benefits (in the US) including a 401k with employer contribution, FSA,
annual performance bonuses, and transit reimbursement. Please inquire about
benefits in Canada.

*Our Development Practices*
Our backend code is largely written in Perl and Go using PostgreSQL and
Linux. We maintain high standards for our development practices. All new
code is expected to include automated tests run by TeamCity, and all work
goes through internal code review on GitHub Enterprise.

We use free software as much as possible, and we release code back to the
community when we can do so. We're trying to improve the way we do
development, and we expect you to participate in that process.

Required skills:
* Excellent programming skills and a proficiency for developing high
quality code. We expect this engineer to be able to pair program with our
senior software engineers.
* We mostly use Perl and Go for testing software, but we're happy to hear
from developers more familiar with other languages. (A programming exercise
will be given to all applicants.)
* Experience writing tests based on user requirements.
* Experience with testing tools such as TeamCity, Selenium, JMeter, etc.
* Ability to communicate clearly with end users to interpret bug reports
and document them for developers.
* Understanding of SQL databases (Postgres, especially )
* Significant experience developing on a Linux or BSD platform.
* Experience with version control, preferably Git.
* Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
* The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.

Desired skills:
* Performance testing/benchmarking experience.
* FS/OSS contributions. Tell us about them!
