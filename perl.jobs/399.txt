Job title:
Perl Programmer -- UNIX/Mason/mod_perl/DBI

Company name: ArtToday.com, Inc.

Internal ID: 0xdecafbad

Location: United States, AZ, Tucson

Pay rate: D.O.E.

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
ArtToday.com, Inc. is an online clipart business that
currently consists of approximately two dozen websites.

We're looking for a programmer to help design, implement,
and maintain the back-end infrastructure to support our
network of sites.

Required skills:
* Willingness to work as a member of a group of
  programmers.
* Ability to work with non-programmers (designers,
  marketing, customer service, etc).
* Willingness to handle projects large and small, short
  term and long term, planned and unplanned.
* 2+ years of practical programming experience.
* Experience with perl -- the more, the better (intimate
  knowledge of objects, references, modules, etc is
  strongly desirable).
* Experience with high-volume web deployment.
  Graphical design experience is OK, but is no
  replacement for grotty back-end implementation
  experience (which is what we do :-).
* Thorough knowledge of HTML and HTTP.
* Working knowledge of UNIX (Linux, Solaris). We don't
  use Windows/Mac/whatever servers at all.

Desired skills:
* 5+ years of practical programming experience.
* Working knowledge of Apache configuration and operation.
* E-commerce programming experience.
* Experience with perl DBI.
* Familiarity with HTML::Mason and mod_perl.
