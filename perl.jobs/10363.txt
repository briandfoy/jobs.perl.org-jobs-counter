Position Overview 
The position is for a Senior Perl Developer/Perl Programmer working to
develop, enhance, maintain and support the company's hosted services. The
applications delivering the services generally have an interactive user
interface component delivered as dynamic web pages over the Internet as
well as a series of significant server based data processing components.
Candidates will be expected to work on all aspects of the application and
will be required to provide technical support on a rostered basis.
Company 
The company provides a comprehensive and highly functional set of
electronic services to support post-trade processing in the securities
lending and repo markets. Our client base includes the majority of the
top-tier financial institutions who participate in these markets throughout
the world. 

The company services are widely viewed as being best of breed in the market
and our ability to provide services which perform better and are more
functionally rich, user friendly and innovative than our competitors is
legendary. Our focus on service excellence and exceptional flexibility
enables us to regularly exceed our clients' expectations and this ensures
we are almost invariably regarded as the users' service provider of choice.


The company offers the opportunity to work in a small company setting with
other skilled professionals to deliver the highest standard of service
available on the market where good work is both recognised and rewarded.
Role 
The role is for a Perl guru, a genie of the LAMP (which summarises the key
technologies that they use). 
The main responsibilities of the role are to: 
•	Design, develop, test and release new features and enhancements for
their services 
•	Develop tools to improve their operational processes 
•	Investigate and fix software issues in existing systems 
•	Undertake the technical integration of new clients onto the
companies platform 
•	Support and monitor production systems on a rota basis and as
required 
•	Provide support to end users both over the telephone and via
e-mail, always representing the company in a professional manner 
•	Administer their Servers, as and when required 
•	Ensure both code and interfaces are documented appropriately 
•	Keep management appraised of progress on assigned tasks,
particularly with regard to identifying any issues/delays/dependencies in
good time 
•	Identify opportunities for potential system/process improvements or
new/improved products that the company could offer 
•	Work autonomously, within a multifunction team environment
There is the potential for increased responsibility at some point in the
future, depending on the aptitude for such responsibility from the
candidate. 

Challenges 
The key challenges in this role are to: 
•	Rapidly develop an understanding of the technical structure of the
company services, starting initially at the top level, but with increasing
depth over time. 
•	Know when it is appropriate to ask for help from colleagues. 
•	Develop a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the services
they offer and the associated benefits/value proposition each service
provides. 
•	Ensure the company continues to deliver exceptional client service.
(eg by being flexible, having a can do approach, making data integration
easy, understanding client issues) 
•	Understand the limits of your knowledge of the companies services
and refer any client queries where you are unsure of the answer to other
members of staff as required
Requirements: 
•	Good degree/Academic qualifications 
•	Self-motivated, pro-active and autonomous, with good team-working
skills 
•	Ability to absorb and retain complex business and technical
information rapidly 
•	Excellent design and software development skills 
•	Experience in software development for.nix/web deployment 
•	SQL and relational Datamodelling skills 
•	OO design skills, including the ability to apply appropriate OO
patterns 
•	Good communication skills, including the ability to liaise with

end users.
