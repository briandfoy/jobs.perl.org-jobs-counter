Job title: Web App Developer

Company name: House Absolute Consulting

Location: 55408, MN, Minneapolis

Pay rate: $40-70/hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3-5 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a client who needs some work done more quickly than I can do it
myself, so I'm looking for a subcontractor to do most of the actual work,
and I will help spec the work, supervise, and pitch in when possible.

There are two pieces to this work.  In theory, I could have two different
people work on this but I'd prefer to just have one (to simplify my life).

One part of the work is to enhance an existing partially dynamic website by
enhancing the admin backend with some new features.  This is fairly
straight forward database-backed web app development.

The other piece is to enhance the search & reporting features of Rapport
(http://www.rapportware.org/), a free software donor/member database aimed
at nonprofits.	This work will require some JS/AJAX knowledge in addition
to other aspects of web app development.

The HTML/CSS work will be done by a web designer, but you will be
responsible for taking his mockups and turning them into dynamic pages.

The rate will vary based on how much supervision I need to put in.

There is some potential for future work on Rapport as well, and similar
website development work for other clients.  No promises, of course ;)

Required skills:
* Perl, obviously
* Mason
* SQL DBMS knowledge (this project uses MySQL)
* HTML & CSS - you don't need to write it, but you'll be working with it
* JS/AJAX for Rapport piece

Desired skills:
* Experience using Alzabo would be a big plus
