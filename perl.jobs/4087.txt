operational readiness and preventative maintenance. This is an ideal
situation to blossom as a Perl programmer, growing your programming skills
in a Perl-intensive environment, staffed by other strong Perl engineering
talent. Skill with Perl / mod_perl on a Linux / Apache platform and
hands-on, practical experience with real world production systems will be
critical to your success. Experience with MySQL and/ or Oracle will add to
your value as you work on operational support issues for the most advanced
online advertising and marketing system. A history of mod_perl debugging
and optimization of heavy-volume, web-based systems (transactions,
impressions etc.) will give you the foundation needed to ensure
high-performance and scalability of our applications. A love of problem
solving, blazing fast code and a deep understanding of all things Perl will
set the stage for your success in this exciting and challenging role.

premise when working with our customers to identify their goals and
designing a customized advertising solution to deliver the results they
need.

As one of our dedicated and highly regarded Perl Engineers, you will manage
multiple responsibilities which include responding to operational requests
from customers to modify or enhance existing web-based applications,
performing on-call duties for after hours emergencies regarding operational
systems and processes, modifying or enhancing existing web-based
perl/mod_perl applications in accordance with provided feature
specifications, and performing preventative maintenance on existing
applications and services. You will also be tasked with building new, or
maintaining existing, monitoring applications to provide advance notice of
problems that affect the operational readiness of production systems.
Additionally, as our Perl Engineer, you will have the responsibility for
the full lifecycle development of projects, including developing software
functional specifications based on product requirements, writing code to
accomplish specific goals and assist in preparing and implementing test
plans with our QA staff. Your solid communication skills will play a large
role as you interact with application users in order to identify and debug
problems with operational systems in response to bug tickets. If you desire
a challenge and appreciate being recognized for your efforts, and enjoy
being part of a winning team, you owe it to yourself to explore this
opportunity with a recognized leader in the online marketing space!
