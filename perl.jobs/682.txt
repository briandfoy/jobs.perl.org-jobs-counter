Job title:
mod_perl/Mason/mysql - work remote - arts!

Company name: MindsIsland

Internal ID: mi_perl1

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: Negotiable/Project Rate

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Part Time/Ongoing

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Looking for some help in building out our site, www.mindsisland.com - a
site which provides memberships and services to artists. We are in the
process of refining and expanding our site which is built with Apache,
mod_perl, HTML::Mason, and Class::DBI. The database is mySQL, with some
Image::Magick trickery thrown in. Programmers could work remotely and have
regular phone calls with the lead programmer (me). The ideal candidate
would be an up-and-coming perl programmer or student with a good head for
OO design and CPAN. We need about 20 hours per week of work (there are
several project milestones planned), and our budget is not very high, but
there is a lot of learning, creative freedom and spirit on the project! 

We are planning to package and release a good portion of our code to the
open source community, so help with documentation and tests is needed too. 

Required skills:
Perl (obviously), OO experience, Linux, mySQL

Desired skills:
Mod_perl, HTML::Mason, documentation skills, testing, Class::DBI or other
persistant storage mechanisms, a good sense of humor.
