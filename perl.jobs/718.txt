Job title: Perl, SQL & Widgets

Company name: InnerSpace

Location: America, Florida, Palm Coast

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: < 30 days

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need web development that would allow a site visitor to specify multiple
criteria about an item, do a SQL query of a database and return a list of
matching items. Example: "I want to see all of your widgets that are red,
triangular and have between 2 and 4 holes in them." A list would be
returned to the visitor who could then pick any one of the widgets returned
and have a descriptive page displayed fot that particularr widget. That
detail page would necessarily contain one or more .jpg's and would also
contain links to one or more .jpg's. This is not at all unlike numerous
ecommerce sites that allow you to refine search criteria via combo boxes
and the they return a page that shows you all the "hits." Also, the site is
hosted on unix boxes but I would like to use MS Excel or Access to maintain
the database. A fianl note, this site will *not* be used for ecommerce.

Required skills:
Perl, SQL, ASP (unless this can all be done using perl??), ODBC
connectivity.
