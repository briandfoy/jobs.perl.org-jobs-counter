Location: United Kingdom

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1-2 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hi

I need a web GUI developer for a one off project. The GUI will be used to
configure an appliance-like server and will be preferably written in very
well commented Perl. You may make a short speech as to why you want to
write it in something else if you like.


My preferred two options are "faster" and "better" so I'm willing to pay, I
think, quite well.


More details on request.
