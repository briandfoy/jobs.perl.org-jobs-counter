Job title:
Perl-Coding Test Subjects Needed for ThinkGeek Science Experiment

Company name: ThinkGeek

Internal ID: Senior Programmer

Location: United States, Virginia, Fairfax

Pay rate: Commensurate with Experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Here at ThinkGeek Laboratories, we are constantly developing new
technologies to drive our web site and its attendant systems, but we have
reached the bandwidth limits of our current team and need to further
parallelize. Thus, we have embarked on an experiment to overlay Randal
Schwartz's programming-related memory engrams on other staff members.

Unfortunately, early test subjects have not taken the process well. Not
only are we nearly out of PHBs, but our budget for institutionalizing prior
subjects is limited. We are therefore seeking subjects with extensive Perl
coding experience, as we believe this will ease the restructuring of the
mental pathways.

Subjects in ThinkGeek experiments will have opportunities to play with cool
new stuff long before it appears on Engadget or Gizmodo, root access to the
machine that goes "ping," and an atmosphere where you can pick your hours,
run any desktop OS you like, and the freedom to wear shoes whenever your
pinky toes are not hooked up to transcutaneous electrodes.

Our software is developed in-house, so projects will run a wide gamut of
business areas (accounting to warehouse management, and everything in
between). Development will be on an existing suite of software, so the
ability to adapt to and extend an existing architecture is a must.
Responsibilities will include: web/console/batch based application
development, maintaining and configuring development servers, participation
in requirements and specifications gathering processes, software quality
assurance and internal documentation. The ideal candidate should have
strong Linux skills and be able to work and learn new skills independently
when necessary, but also work as part of a team.

ThinkGeek is a small, close-knit group of fun, weird, and enthusiastic
people who run one of the most successful niche e-commerce sites on the
Internets. As part of SourceForge, Inc, a publicly held company, ThinkGeek
employees receive an excellent benefits package while enjoying the benefits
of working in an exciting start-up environment in our Fairfax, Virginia
office. This posting is for a permanent, full time position in our Fairfax,
Virginia office. Only local applicants or those willing to relocate at
their own expense will be considered.

Required skills:
    * 5+ years professional programming experience with Perl 5

    * 4+ years professional experience working with databases (SQL)

    * Extensive knowledge of Apache and familiarity with Apache module
development

    * Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in
an exacting manner

    * Team-oriented personality

    * Know how to work hard and have fun

Desired skills:
    * Experience developing automated functional and performance testing
suites

    * XML

    * HTML/XHTML

    * Javascript/AJAX

    * Solid Linux Knowledge (4+ years of experience with Linux or Unix
systems)

    * Retail industry software development experience

    * Web Services development (servers/clients)

    * First name Jen or Tim a plus
