Job title:
web app programmer (perl/xslt/postgres/linux )

Company name: BuildSite

Location: United States, CA, Oakland

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Be the primary developer resource for a small but stable 
company in Oakland.
Will maintain an existing perl web app, and add new features to it.
Most be comfortable working in a vertical business, with mostly
non-technical peers.

Required skills:
Should be strong in 3 out of the 5:
   perl, CSS, xslt, SQL, unix-like systems
and have familiarity with others.
"strong" means:
Perl: you know when it is appropriate to use "local"
CSS: you usually guess right about when to use "margin: auto" versus
"text-align: center"
XSLT: you know the difference between
an XSLT 1.0 node-set and a 2.0 sequence
SQL: you can compose a working 3-way aggregated join in just a few tries
unix-like: you can find all pdf files below a directory that changed in the
past week, in under a minute
