Company name: Zappos.com, Inc.

Location: United States, Nevada, Las Vegas

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Position Summary and Required Skills: 
Zappos.com is looking for expert web developers to join our small team of
practical programmers!	Applicants must be fluent in Perl and SQL, and have
plenty of experience working with mod_perl, MySQL, Apache, Linux, HTML and
other general web technologies in a secure environment.  Excellent
communication skills with both technical and non-technical people are a
must. Work will require strong self-motivation in taking projects from the
initial request through delivery and ongoing refinement.


Required skills:
If you enjoy a laid back but fast paced programming environment, where the
focus is on writing code that people actually use then you'll like it at
Zappos.  We prefer simple and straightforward to clever and pretty. We
prefer time-tested fundamentals to fancy new technology.  We each have our
areas of expertise in the system, but we also like being able to hop into
each other's code in a pinch and make a few tweaks to meet the
ever-changing needs of our customers and employees.  Because of this we
like comments and consistency, and friendly programming.  We like making
things work.
