Job title:
Free lunch for a Perl developer in the world’s most liveable city

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: Vienna, Austria

Pay rate: from €40k/y depending on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Very well-known and established e-commerce brand in beautiful Vienna,
Austria looking for Perl developers, or experienced developers willing to
learn Perl.

The technical stack is a mix of Modern Perl and more
traditional technologies — some parts of the product are written using
Dancer, some mod_perl2. Postgres forms the major backend database, with
some help from Elastic Search for search-engine components. In addition,
you’ll be working with some very well-known Perl folk in a team committed
to technical excellence.

Quite apart from free lunch and snacks, Western
European holidays and pension scheme, the company’s located in beautiful
Vienna. “Vienna continues its reign in the top spot for overall quality of
living” for 9 years running; the world’s best coffee, pretzels, and one of
the world’s least annoying airports (source: personal experience) for when
it’s time to get out of the city.

German isn’t required, but would be a
bonus, but an existing right to work in the EU is.
