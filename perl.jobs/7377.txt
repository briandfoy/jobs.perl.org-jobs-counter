Job title: Perl/MySQL programmer - short job

Company name: SolsticeSun Design

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2  to 4 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Perl/MySQL programmer needed, Embperl a plus
Perl/MySQL programmer needed, Embperl a plus
The existing system uses Embperl and MySQL to implement a small CMS. The
client uploads "papers" (html documents with images). The CMS lets them
specify author, date, title and summary information for each paper. A
search system does a combined search on the database and the files on the
file system. To print a window pops up with the content of the "paper:
minus the website shell.

We need someone to make a few small extensions to the system.

1. Add an optional "executive summary" to papers. This is longer than the
current 255 character limited summary, and will be HTML (and available as
PDF for print purposes). It could be stored on disk as with the main paper,
or in a larger text field. In either case it will need to be added to the
upload/edit tools. It will need to be searched, and the end-user should
have the option of viewing either of the items. 

2. Add the option to upload a PDF version of the paper (generation of the
PDF isn't required), and give the user the PDF when they want to print
instead of the pop-up window. Therefore some "papers" will have a PDF and
some will be old style with a pop-up window.

We expect that the work may require some minor extensions to the document
database schema, depending on how the executive summary is stored. The
database schema does include some extra 255 character fields which can be
used to store relative links to on-disk data, or a new TEXT field could be
added.	The create/read/update/search routines will need to be updated to
support the new data. The admin pages will need explicit fields for
creating/updating summaries and PDFs.  The search and result pages will
need some additional fields and a small amount of Embperl code to handle
the new data.  Basic HTML coding will be required, but we will worry about
making it look pretty.


Required skills:
Perl, MySQL, Embperl, some HTML knowlege, SFTP
