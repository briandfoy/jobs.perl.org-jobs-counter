Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Looking to hire several experienced OO Perl developers to be part of
backend object-oriented Perl development in Linux/Unix (many flavors).
Client side is PHP, Perl, JavaScript, SOAP, AJAX, etc.

Oldest version of Perl supported is 5.8.7 (although we might migrate to
5.10 on all supported platforms once it is burned in).

As far as coding conventions, we use PBP and peer review (use strict; and
use warnings; are mandatory). Warnings are fatal (causing a die to occur).
All code must compile on all supported platforms prior to commit (Linux,
Solaris, Win32, HP-UX, AIX, others).

Required skills:
* Current hands-on experience in OO Perl (C++, PHP receive bonus points)

* TCP/IP networking and/or distributed systems programming

* Experience with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL

* Fluency in Linux (flavors of UNIX receive bonus points)

* If you have TEAM LEAD experience in addition to the above, you'll receive
bonus points...lots of them
