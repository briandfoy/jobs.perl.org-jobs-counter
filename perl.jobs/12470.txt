Job title:
2 Open Perl Positions - Help us secure the net for normal website owners!

Company name: WebPub.com

Location: Earth!

Pay rate: USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Hi everyone!

We have two open Perl positions at WebPub.com, first I'll tell you a little
about what we are building and then the positions.

Quick 30 seconds on what we are building and why...
There is a big problem on the internet with WordPress, Drupal, and other
scripts getting hacked because non tech website owners don't know they need
to upgrade those scripts on a regular basis. When this happens spam,
malware, and other nasty stuff emerge and we want to stop that. My business
partner and I own a hosting company with 40,000+ customers and 80+ staff
around the world, and we are tired of seeing our customers frustrated by
this. The answer? WebPub.com is a system that keeps scripts automaticly
upgraded over FTP (secure ftp whenever possible). Right now we are in beta
and the system is working great with WordPress (which is the only script we
support currently). We are expanding the team to add more scripts and
accelerate development of our core. 

The system is divided into a PHP Frontend and a Perl backend API. We want
the backend complexity to be as invisible to end users as possible in order
to make it as easy for possible for hem. Currently we are planning out a
scheduler for the automatic upgrades and possiblly a gearman implementation
for multiple worker servers. 

Position #1 - We need a Perl/Moose dev to work with our existing team on
the guts of what runs the backend perl setup. This could be things like
adding new features such as gearman or a scheduler, figuring out an API
bug, adding an API command, or figuring out how to get around an FTP block
due to a user posting the wrong password. 

Position #2 - We need a Perl/Moose developer to write the mini Perl
programs inside of our system that install and upgrade different scripts
such as Drupal, Joomla, Magento. This is going to be incredibly challenging
as you are going to be dealing with a lot of different pieces of software
and it will bring a new challenge every few weeks as they are implemented.
It would be beneficial to have a working knoweldge of WordPress or similar
scripts so that you come to the job with a clear understanding of what it
takes to do a new install of a script, to upgrade it, and so on.

We are 100% remote as a company, so you need to be comfortable working from
home. We offer vacation, annual pay reviews, etc! 

Feel free to hit me up with any questoins too!
