I had a typo in my previous post.  Here is the corrected URL.  Thank 
you!  Sorry for the inconvenience.

On-line version: http://www.blainsoftwareservices.com/perl_programmer.html

Hello,

I have experience in web development using the Perl DBI especially with 
MySQL and have recently developed a toolset for use with these.

I am from the Lansing, Michigan area in the USA.

I would prefer to telecommute rather than to relocate, but am not opposed 
to on-site projects in the Michigan area.

I am interested in either full time or part time positions.  I prefer 
contract but would also consider a permanent position.

I have had experience in the following areas:

Web Based Application Development
MySQL
Perl DBI Module
Apache Web Server in the Linux Environment
Javascript
Postgres
SSL Secure Sites
Encryption
Sockets and pop3 email applications

Thank you.

Best regards,

Paul Blain
