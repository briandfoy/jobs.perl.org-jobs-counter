Job title: Twiki debugging

Company name: Cubehut

Internal ID: none

Location: telecommute

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: short project

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
About 6 months ago, I had a developer write a "fast save" option for my
twiki.	It simply skipped the "preview" button and saved directly.

All worked well for several months.  Then we started seeing errors on
saving.  I've had a developer spend a lot of time debugging and he came to
the conclusion that there's a problem with the webserver.

Since this was on a hosted server, we moved to a dedicated server.  The
problem continued.

We've done a fresh reinstall (several times, on both the old server, and
the new one), and its still there.

We're not sure if our data is corrupted, or if the issue is something else.
 We're at wits end.

The error only appears intermittently, and particularly happens when
editing different twiki webs - less so on the same web.  Its almost like it
just happens only once per session per web.

This is the full error which appears:

Inproper use of the save script 
You cannot call this script directly, TWikibeta uses it internally. 
Some browser configurations occasionally send undefined data to the server.
Don't worry, your changes are not lost. Just click the Back button on your
browser and then try Save again. 

The other possibility is an internal error in TWikibeta configuration, or
that you did not have write access to the directory or file that was being
edited. 

Please go back in your browser and save the topic. 

If someone is interested in helping with this on a paid basis, please email
me at twikihelp@tasdevil.com.  I am happy to work out a rate that is fair
for your time, and can pay by paypal or however you prefer.  Additionally I
have additional work that comes up if you're interested.
