Job title: Perl Software Engineer (multiple)

Company name: Topix.net

Location: United States, CA, Palo Alto

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're a growing SF Bay Area startup automating the collection, editing and
distribution of online news.

Our platform is heavy perl with web crawling, document clustering, a
massive Knowledge Base, subject and geo-categorization AI, and a fast
modperl/mmap based presentation engine.  In addition to our website traffic
we're also serving over 2 million RSS feed fetches/day.  Our group
previously built the Open Directory Project at Netscape/AOL.

We need help building out the HAL-9000 of news. We're looking to hire
coders fluent in C and Perl in the Bay Area, as well as a network/system
administrator.	You can get a sense of our development philosophy on our
blog, e.g.  http://blog.topix.net/archives/000045.html

We have a full benefits package, options, and a great office environment. 
If you think you might be interested, shoot us an email and we can have a
quick call or set up an informal chat to see if we both think it would be a
good fit.

Resumes and inquiries should be sent to jobs@topix.net.


Principals only, please.
