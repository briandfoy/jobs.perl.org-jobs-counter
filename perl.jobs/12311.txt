Job title: Perl Software Developer

Company name: CIDC

Location: Cambridge, MA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you want the official HR-approved blurb, it's below.  I'm giving you a
less formal take first.

The primary duty of this team is to support and enhance the affiliate
advertising software systems.  We work with an excellent, highly clueful
business representative who knows the ins and outs of the business side of
affiliate advertising and referral tracking.  We have a project owner and a
management team that shield us from a great deal of business BS so we can
focus on our work -- but we have adopted Scrum as a methodology, so you
will be expected to participate in planning and you will be held
accountable for your commitments and for the quality of your work.  

We have a few interesting new projects coming up, and we're also looking at
writing better test suites on some older software so that we can refactor
it.  There's a lot of interesting stuff coming up for sure.

Do note that this is an on-site job in Cambridge, MA.  

And now, the official job description:
