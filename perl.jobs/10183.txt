Job title:
Perl Hacker at SayHired Inc in San Bruno, CA 

Company name: SayHired

Location: United States, CA, San Bruno

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
About Us: 
Our mission is to offer the world’s fastest and most accurate candidate
sourcing and screening SaaS at the most cost-effective prices. 
1,000+ candidates go through SayHired's application each month - including
start ups and Fortune 100 companies. 
We have a great team and revenues are growing. 
SayHired is disrupting the $240 billion recruiting market. Come help us
ruffle the suits - we’re just getting started. 
About the Job: 
Design and lead the development of amazing applications, including
continuing development of SayHired's APIs. 
Write clean, re-usable code. Elegant code that’s simple and will be read by
and used by thousands of recruiters around the world. 
Make browsers submit to your will. Ship things that look great and perform
well. 


Required skills:
A minimum of 3 years of coding experience (school counts), 15+ yrs is fine
too, what matters is that you have experience working on both the server
side and the client side. 
Opinions and “technical taste” about languages, frameworks and tools based
on hands on experience, not other people's blog posts. 
Your core skill is not cutting and pasting code - or using libraries. You
build libraries and write code that other people use. 
You are obsessed (borderline compulsive actually) about making user
interfaces look right and work right. This occasionally causes you to go
long periods of time without sleep. You dig the science of user experience
and have opinions. 
You love to make an impact and thrive in small, collaborative, energetic
teams. 
You communicate well out loud, on paper and in code. 


Desired skills:
You’ve made a substantial contribution to a widely used open source
project. Huge bonus points if you started or lead a project. 
You’ve built a web application that’s seen some scale. 
You read up on and experiment with new technologies because it’s in your
nature, not because it’s a job requirement. You don’t just learn how things
work, you learn why. 
Basic skills with a visual design tool like Photoshop or Fireworks 
Formal training in computer science (bachelors, masters, whatever)
