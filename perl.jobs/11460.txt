Job title: Perl Programmer - Full time Telecommute

Company name: Ionzero 

Internal ID: Ionzero-705

Location: United States, CO, Fort Collins

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:


Ionzero is growing again! We are looking for two perl programmers to join
our team. Spanish speakers preferred, but don't let that stop you if you
are a solid Perl developer.  This is a full time telecommute position. 

Ionzero is a software development consultancy company. We have customers
around the US and around the world. Our job is to figure out how our
customers' software can be better, and then make it so. We set out to
create the kind of company we always wanted to work for where there were
good people, interesting projects, solid software and flexible (and
reasonable) hours. We've accomplished that for the last 6 years and now our
business is expanding faster than ever before.

We work in many languages (Perl, PHP, Java, whatever our customers need)
but right now we are looking for Perl programmers.

Our clients are all over the place, so you need to be able to work well via
email and our project management system. You must be self motivated and we
expect that if you say you will do something, you will. If you CAN do that
and write good solid code, we want to talk to you.

If this all sounds like you, send a resume along with sample code (or cpan
pointers) and your availability/salary requirements. 

Required skills:
* SQL databases (particularly MySQL and Postgresql).

* Familiarity with CPAN.

* Web technologies such as HTML / CSS / Javascript.

* Version control (SVN / Git / etc.)

Desired skills:
* Modern Perl (and Object Oriented tools like Moose) a plus.

* Catalyst web framework (or other MVC development) a plus

* Fluency in Spanish a huge benefit.
