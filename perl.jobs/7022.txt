Job title:
perl programmer to help save US healthcare sytem

Company name: athenahealth

Location: MA, Watertown

Pay rate: Market

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We’re looking for hackers who want to make a social difference.

Our company, athenahealth, is growing at a meteoric rate, and we’re
aggressively hiring at all levels. Our goal is to bring order to the chaos
of U.S. healthcare, in which hundreds of thousands of medical practices
navigate a Byzantine set of clinical and business processes wrought by
decades of managed care. We do this by offering a software-as-service
solution that embeds insurance rules and clinical processes directly into
our practice management & electronic medical platform. In essence, we are
building an operating system for the medical office that abstracts away
administrative complexity, leaving doctors free to practice medicine.
 
The development team here is among the best you’d find at any company in
the world. The working environment is friendly and open. The folks that you
will be working with are top-notch, and will probably be some of the best
and brightest folks you’ve ever worked with regardless of where you’re
coming from—folks who would otherwise work at Google, Oracle, hedge funds,
or startups, but have decided to come here because they want to help change
healthcare at a fundamental level and believe that we honestly have a shot.


In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of Web 2.0 techniques
thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we believe
any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of a
couple of months. We're more interested in folks with raw talent and a
burning desire to succeed. The types of problems you might work on are
wide-ranging—from core performance tuning to optimizing paper-based
processes using OCR to writing AJAX widgets in complicated (yet simple!)
user interfaces.

We’re aggressively growing at all levels. Compensation is competitive, and
as long as you get stuff done, we’re flexible about work schedules. If
you’d like to apply, shoot over a resume. The only real technical
requirement for applying is being able to make a computer do what you want
it to do.


Required skills:
We are looking for raw talent.	Knowing some perl is nice, but we believe
any hacker worth his/her salt can learn perl in a couple of months.

To that point, some formal training in CS is preferred but if you're a
self-taught hacker we'll give you a shot.  Or maybe you've been stuck in a
psychics lab or proving some cool math proof and want to do something else
with your coding skills.   

Desired skills:
Linux with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache
