Job title:
LAMP programming for Online Educational Virtual World

Company name: Numedeon, Inc. Whyville.net

Location: United States, California, Pasadena

Pay rate: $20/hour USD

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Whyville.net is an online educational virtual world for 8-12 year olds. 
Our goal is to make an online world so enjoyable that kids love playing in
it and so educational that they end up learning a lot while they play.

We use a combination of Perl CGI and Java servlets on the back-end.  We
need a programmer who can support the website in many ways: designing and
implementing online games and activities, writing utilities, generating
statistics, etc.

We are a small, mostly virtual organization, but we try to meet once a week
in Pasadena, California, so being able to join us in person for that
meeting would increase your attractiveness.

If you enjoy working with children, education, and online worlds, and you
have the skills we seek, we'd love to have you join us.

Required skills:
* Perl/DBI, HTML, SQL, Java, and CVS are required skills.

* Moderate Linux experience:  You should be able to install a Linux
distribution and set up a LAMP stack yourself.

* Must be self-motivated.  We are a small and very busy team, so we have
little time for managing.  We need a programmer who can quickly understand
requirements and satisfy them with minimal supervision.

* Excellent English writing and speaking skills are important.
