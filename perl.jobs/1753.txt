I am working for a company that is looking for someone with strong Perl
skills to do QA. They are a pre-IPO company that has been profitable for
the last four quarters. You can see more information about them on the
website at www.tellme.com <http://www.tellme.com/>=20

Both positions will be responsible for developing test plans based on
design specifications, executing test plans, and also writing and
maintaining test scripts in PERL or a similar high-level language.
Additionally, they will contribute towards the success of client
projects by coordinating with project team members -- including
integration architects, developers, and project managers -- in order to
prevent, report, and resolve product defects.

experience=20
