Job title: freelance mod_perl/DBI programmer

Company name: Barkani

Internal ID: N/A

Location: United States, New York, New York City

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Ongoing

Hours: Flexible

Description:
Looking for a freelancer to do site development and ongoing site and server
maintenance.

The immediate need is to maintain and develop two existing applications.
The first is a mod_perl/oracle/apache website that interfaces with a
third-party accounting system through a virtual terminal we built. The
second is a mod_perl/oracle/apache event management piece that synchs with
mod_perl/postrgres registration sites. (This second one needs development
plus a complete rebuild.)

There are other, smaller, sites, that also need occassional maintenance
work. And some new sites that will need to be developed.

This freelance position will be ongoing.

Required skills:
Mod_perl, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache, Debian, Red Hat, HTML, DHTML,
CGI, Javascript, etc.

This is not an intro position. You'll be expected to hit the floor running
from day one.

Desired skills:
PHP skills are preferable. Some windows experience would be nice.
