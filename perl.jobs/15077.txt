Description:

is passionate about their craft, who thrives on challenge and who believes
in success through collaboration. Whether it is hardening Perl's hash

B.responsible

Our technical culture derives strongly from our
strong ties to the Perl community. We appreciate what open source means
both for our business and also for internal projects. Some of our most
useful hacks inside the company have come from someone scratching the
proverbial itch. We are actively engaged and enjoy the benefits our culture
produces such as increased communication between each other and also to our
business counterparts.

the development, performance, and scaling of our public website as well as
internal systems, which includes using: Perl (5.14), DBI, Mason, Moose,
Sereal, Plack, nginx, Javascript, MySQL, Memcached, Redis, Hadoop,
Elasticsearch, git, and CentOS Linux. You will work independently and will
also be responsible for making technical decisions within a team. Our
development strategy is agile and we work in small Scrum teams of 5-7. We
do several rollouts every day. We are data-driven and do extensive A/B
testing.

Even without Perl experience, your colleagues will help you get
up to speed in order to be able to start solving real problems from day
one.

Important aspects of the job include:

Rapidly develop
next-generation scalable, flexible, and high-performance systems.
Solve
issues with the site and internal systems, prioritizing based on customer
impact
Act as an intermediary for problems, with both technical and
non-technical audiences
