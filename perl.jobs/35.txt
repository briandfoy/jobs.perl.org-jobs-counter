Subject: Perl Developers in Dallas Tx
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: ebullock@summitnetworking.com ("Eric Bullock")

If you are interested in the below listed position please email me your
resume ( mailto:ebullock@summitnetworking.com ) and let me know the best
time and number to reach you at.

OO Developer
Perl, Java on a UNIX Platform
Permanent Full Time Positions
Dallas, TX

Local Dallas Company needs three (3) mid level and one (1) entry-level heads
down programmers for a ramp-up they are doing for a Perl/Unix migration to
Java. They are hiring now with the migration to come over the next six (6)
months.

Our client is looking for the right Candidates to fill his team. The
existing team is made up of five (5) developers now and they need to bring
that number up to 9 as soon as possible.

This is an exciting company with great benefits, 401K (eligible after one
year of employment), stock options that vest after one year at 25% and then
1/48 per month of employment thereafter until full vesting is accomplished
at month 48. Quarterly bonuses are offered quarterly on company performance
and are paid in company stock options. This is not a start up company; this
is an industry leader in the Internet travel business with 10 years history
and cash in the bank. A company that realizes it’s IT group is the company
and you are considered a true asset, not a liability.

Our client is looking for;

1.	OO Developers with strong Analytical skills from entry level to 3 years
experience.
2.	Prefers Perl and/or Java background on a UNIX platform but will train the
right Candidate in either technology or both. MS Developers are not
generally a match for this client.
3.	Prefers degreed Candidates with a BSCS to any other degree. Will consider
other degrees and the right Candidate with no degree.
4.	Must have excellent communication skills (a must ) for interfacing with
clients.
5     Long-Term “Personalities”.

The company offers;
Exciting Internet company with a strong presence and over 1600 affiliations
world-wide.
Debt free 10 year old company with cash in the bank.
Great stock options, 401K, great benefits, flex hours and no travel.


The interview process will be a phone interview and/or an in person for
local Candidates to meet the team and see the environment/culture. The
technical interview will be with the Director and two (2) of the team
members for an analytical feel and not so much technical detail.



Thank You
