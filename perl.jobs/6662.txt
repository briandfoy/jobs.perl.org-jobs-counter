Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are a small (16 person) agile software development company in the
western suburbs and Chicago. We use Perl, Ruby on Rails, and some other
technologies. 

In addition, we teach course on Ruby on Rails, TDD, Agile Project
Management and we do short-term, intensive coaching engagements. We usually
have a presenter or two at the large software conferences, sharing what
we've learned.

We have a client list that spans from hi-tech leaders (Google), media
companies (MTV), and main-line fortune 1000s (Sears) and a host of
startups.

If you love software, want to work with Perl and Ruby on Rails building
great Web applications in an agile environment, let's talk.

We are a Mac OS X- and Linux-centric company.

Maybe best of all, you'll get to use GMail for your corporate email and
ditch MS Outlook once and for all!
