looking to develop a long-term working relationship with talented,
self-motivated people who could complement and extend our existing team.

What's most important to us is the overall quality and expertise of the
team, so we are open to considering a variety of ways of working in order
to get the right people. That could including flexible working, full-time,
part-time, fixed hours variable hours or casual work.

The role would involve working from home, communicating with team members
mainly by email & phone, and may involve the occasional on-site meeting, as
well as monthly team-meetings in or around London.

At this point we are interested in opening a dialogue with excellent people
who like how we work and feel like a good fit, so we can explore the
possibilities for integrating them into the team in a way that suits both
us and you.

but you will be excellence for your level of experience. You know who you
are. If you fit the bill, send us a CV and let's explore the possibilities.
