Job title: Perl ETL Developer

Company name: AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)

Location: Austin, TX     ** ON SITE ONLY / South Austin **

Pay rate: $50+/hour, doe

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 months (possible subsequent renewal or FTE hire)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're still seeking a Perl developer with experience in backend analytics
systems and reporting.

** PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS AN ON SITE OPPORTUNITY ONLY **
Please do not apply for this position if you do not live in the greater
Austin, TX vicinity.

We are looking for a seasoned developer (NOT a scripter!) to join a team of
three other Perl developers that's responsible for maintaining and
enhancing a legacy ETL system that loads engineering microchip test data to
a MySQL database. The idea candidate will have a minimum of 5 years of
experience with Perl in addition to at least 1 year working in an OLAP data
warehousing environment.

Much of this system was developed by others and is in bad need of
refactoring. Comfort with both refactoring legacy code and fluency with SQL
queries are important.

Since stabilizing and scaling this system is of primary concern, there may
be opportunity to port code to, and work with newer tools in this space
such as Hadoop.

Required skills:
You MUST have solid Perl development skills. In addition to familiarity
with Version Control concepts, editors/IDEs, and an understanding of Perl
Best Practices, you must also have concrete experience writing modular
code; be proficient with the ins and outs of Perl's OO system; be
comfortable in a Linux server environment; and have a good grasp of SQL
queries and optimization strategies.

A code sample is REQUIRED from any serious candidates. If you do not have a
code sample handy please inquire for our standard coding task that can be
used in lieu of a code sample.

Desired skills:
Pluses: MySQL administration/tuning, and experience with query optimized
analytic Data Warehouse schemata such as the star and snowflake patterns.
Also, experience with Java, PHP, or the R statistical language.

BIG Pluses: Perl Unit Testing literacy, Agile (Scrum, XP, TDD), 'Modern
Perl' conventions and modules, and being a CPAN author.
