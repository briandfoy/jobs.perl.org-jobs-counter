Job title: Perl Programmer for embedded systems

Company name: Eatoni Ergonomics, Inc.

Location: United States, New York, New York

Pay rate: 2003 W2 prorated + bonus + stock

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Look around www.eatoni.com. In your cover letter, give us at least one
good reason why you and Eatoni are a good match. Submissions which do
not meet this criterion will hit the spam filter.

If you are interested in applying, we will need some sizable samples
of code (preferably in C and Perl, but any language will do)
for analysis. There is really no substitute for this.

If possible, send samples of your finest work.	However, we recognize
that code is written under varying constraints and for very differen
 reasons and at different stages in one's career. Therefore, if there is
anything you wish to tell us about your code, please include this. For
example, if the code was produced under time pressure, if there are things
you would now do differently (and why), if your coding style has changed,
if looking at your code you see other shortcomings or even bugs etc.
____About Eatoni___

Text entry for mobile devices is the "tipping point" technology for the
mobile internet. You need to be able to enter text quickly and easily
using a very small device. It needs to work in any language. It needs
to be reliable.

Eatoni has been working for almost 6 years to make such technology
available. We've developed a good customer base and are profitable.

We are looking for someone to run and extend our core
integration software, and help us build new versions thereof.
You will deal directly with customers to deliver
software built to their specifications. You will also be involved in
research and development efforts to increase the reliability, security,
and efficiency of our text entry methods.  We are constantly making
improvements and expanding our linguistic repertoire.

This is a dream job for people who

*care about the mobile internet
*care about linguistics
*think clean and powerful code is beautiful
*like New York City
*thrive in a small-company environment
