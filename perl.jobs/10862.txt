Job title: Perl Web Programmer

Company name: JST Software, Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Santa Monica

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
A new startup based in downtown Santa Monica, CA is looking for a great
Perl web programmer. Someone deeply familiar with web programming from the
front-end to the back-end. The more experience with Linux and the
server-side of things the better, but it's not required.

For the time being we're hiring on a contract basis, with potential for a
full-time position that includes salary and equity.

Candidates in Santa Monica or Los Angeles are preferred, but working
remotely is also possible for the right programmer.

Please do not send your resume without code samples. We're looking for Perl
programmers, not PERL programmers and we need a way to filter. We think
code is the best filter.

Thanks.

Required skills:
Expert knowledge of Perl, HTTP, DNS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the DOM, RDBMS.

Desired skills:
Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Linux, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached
