Job title: contact Job for Perl/email systems developer 

Company name: Tyche International Inc.

Internal ID: TY-A-01

Location: United States, CA, Fremont

Pay rate: US$ 55/hr.

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 6-12 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Please	find the job description below,
***********************************************
Position:		  UI/Perl/DB/C++/Email Consultant
Type:			   Contract
Duration:	       +6 Months & Extendable
Exp:			8-10 yrs.
Location:		San Francisco Bay area
Rate:			$55/hr.

Description:
We need Perl skills for Admin Console and user management. This is not very
much UI at all and is mostly maintenance so there is actually very little
UI development, and our UI is very simple HTML with nothing fancy (no
client side JavaScript coding). It will be primarily Perl and working with
existing features that include user management, user sync between systems
including some SSO, security related changes, reporting, bug fixes, etc. A
mix of the usual tasks of these types of systems.

I wouldn't require significant HTML or UI experience, it's mostly Perl and
the ability to jump into existing code and make enhancements, fix bugs and
add some features. 
For a talented individual they could work on a more substantial new
feature.

They must also have some experience on email (like yahoo, etc) development
as well.

Grit and determination are just as important for this position, I just need
someone willing to take on a variety of things and get them accomplished
quickly.

A position for C++/email is probably separate, but if someone has these
additional skills that would allow more flexibility.
