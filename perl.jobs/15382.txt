Job description
The Web and Big Data Developer is a junior to mid-level
position responsible for architecting, coding, and operating a new
Advertising and Marketing platform, tightly integrated with hosted
telephony IVR and SMS systems.

You will be responsible for the
design/architecture, coding, and operation of the full stack of the new
platform built on scalable IaaS and PaaS services (AWS or Google Cloud
services).

Desired skills:
Key Responsibilities: 
•  Minimum of 3 years of Perl coding skills	
• 
Traditional RDBMS (MySQL/Postgres)
•	NoSQL (DynamoDB, Datastore,
Mongo, Couch, ElasticSearch, etc)
•	Scalable data logging (Kafka, AWS
Kinesis, etc)
•	Streaming and ETL data analytics (Storm, Spark, etc)
•	Messaging (Google Pub/Sub, SNS, etc)
•	Data warehousing (S3,
Google Storage, etc)
•	Telephony IVR and SMS integration via API
(Five9, Trumpia)
•	Linux VMs or containers (EC2, GCE, etc) for
components that may not have suitable hosted solutions.

Initial
development will involve heavy back-end coding. High-level, the platform
will:
•	Customize IVR flows in a hosted enterprise phone system
(Five9) via API
•	Integrate with a hosted SMS platform (Trumpia SMS)
APIs
•	Stream IVR and SMS result data into a log for flexible real
time processing
•	Process the IVR/SMS data into RDBMS and warehousing
data store
•	Develop analytic streams from collected data and 3rd
party sources to align marketing campaigns according to data analysis.
•   
   Customize fluid IVR flows based on previous response data.
•      
Provide a functional UI interface for administration, campaign management,
reporting. A full featured UI will be implemented after the initial
back-end development is complete (front-end does not have to be your
strength).
