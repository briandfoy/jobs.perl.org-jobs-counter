Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are Best Practical Solutions, the people behind Request Tracker (RT),
one of the most popular ticketing systems in the world. RT, and its
companion application, Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR), are
used by organizations large and small, across all industries including:
private and public companies, security teams, academic institutions,
government agencies, and non-profits. We've been around since 2001 and are
entirely self-funded. We are both contributors to, and beneficiaries of,
the free software ecosystem; you can find all of our code on GitHub.

We're
looking for a senior software engineer to join our growing team and keep
adding to and improving RT.

This role involves all aspects of software
engineering: implementing new features, testing and reviewing branches
created by co-workers and even community contributors, building customer
sponsored features, documentation, and responsibly addressing security
vulnerabilities. RT is a mature codebase that sits right in the middle of
the technologies underlying the internet (web, email, databases,
encryption, etc). As such, our work gives you a deep understanding of the
guts of how the internet actually works.

For the senior software
engineering role, we're specifically looking for someone who can help
mentor the team and move projects to completion. Key to this are activities
like code review, testing and guiding others in testing best practices, and
reviewing completed work against specifications.

Desired skills:
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (or related field) or 5+ years of
practical experience

* Good understanding of web technologies, ideally
Perl, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL

* Experience working in a remote team

* Some Linux system administration, at least enough to be able to install
RT=20=20=20=20

* Comfortable diagnosing & solving technical problems with
customers over email for both projects & support

* Strong knowledge of
git, version control concepts, automated testing

* Experience with
ticketing systems, workflow, or related software products, even as an
active and interested user
