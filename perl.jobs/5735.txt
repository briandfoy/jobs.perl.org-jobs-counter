Job title:
Perl/mod_perl expert, short-term contract

Company name: Yahoo!

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Two months or less

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
The Yahoo! Media Infrastructure group needs an experienced Perl/mod_perl
developer for a short contract (up to 2 months).

You would implement a set of reliable, high-availability, web services
wrapping and extending an existing 3rd-party application (a standalone
server with a Perl API), using an in-house toolkit for REST-style
development. Performance analysis and tuning are likely to be required. 

We'd prefer someone local (San Francisco Bay Area), but telecommuting would
be fine if we could bring you in house for the first week or so.

NOTE: We might be getting an opening for a full-time, *onsite* position,
soon, so let us know if you'd be interested in that, too.


Required skills:
Perl, mod_perl (not mod_perl 2, sadly), Apache configuration and tuning,
XML. Experience with high-volume services.

Desired skills:
Object::InsideOut, network programming experience, DBI and MySQL.
