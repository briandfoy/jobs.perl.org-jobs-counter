Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Adestra Limited

Location: United Kingdom, Oxford

Pay rate: £45,000 + bonus + benefits

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Adestra was formed in 2004 as an email marketing service provider, with a
focus on responsible and sustainable email marketing practices. Since then
we have been successful in developing and deploying our web based email
marketing platform, MessageFocus. We have recently released MessageFocus
v2, a Catalyst/Moose/DBIC-based replacement for MessageFocus v1.

We are looking for an experienced, enthusiastic Perl developer to join our
Oxford-based team to assist in the ongoing development of our MessageFocus
email marketing platform.

Day to day duties are centred on designing and implementing features for
our MessageFocus platform, as well as assisting with its ongoing
maintenance. As a member of a small development team, you will be expected
to take ownership of complete features (from initial concepts,
specification and design through to implementation and deployment), and
have the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the system from
user interface design to scaling high-throughput, high-availability
systems.


Required skills:
A strong understanding of Perl, and experience with modern Perl programming
and development practices is essential, along with some experience of web
interfaces and working with databases.

Desired skills:
Experience with any of the following would be advantageous:

 * PostgreSQL or other modern relational database systems
 * Catalyst or other MVC web frameworks
 * DBIx::Class or ORM systems in general
 * Moose
 * JavaScript
 * User interface design
 * "NoSQL" databases
 * Scaling and optimising web-based applications
 * Designing high-availablity systems

Previous experience with a Catalyst/DBIC/Moose development environment
would be considered a significant advantage.
