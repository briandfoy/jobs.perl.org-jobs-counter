Job title: RSS feed aggregator / parser

Company name: Tritech

Location: CA, LA

Pay rate: US $50.00

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: less than 1 hour if ur good

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
A Contest

$50 prize if you can provide this:

a script (preferably perl or something present on most linux servers) that
aggregates and parses RSS feeds, and provides its output as a new RSS feed.


for example:

1) it opens and reads the Science News RSS feeds from the New York Times,
Reuters, AP, USA Today, etc.
2) it parses all of the feeds from #1 (ie [+yeast OR +saccharomyces] AND
-foot AND -vaginal) would return only stories that mention the term yeast
OR the term saccharomyces AND not the term foot AND not the term vaginal)
3) it returns the result in the form of a RSS feed named MyYeastFeed
4) the aggregate from #1 can be parsed several times, each with different
criteria and output into several different RSS feeds (+web AND +development
AND -spider AND -arachnid returns stories about web development except not
ones about spider webs to a RSS feed called MyWebDevFeed in addition to the
MyYeastFeed provided by the 1st search string).

I believe there are already opensource perl things that do this, and you
can use them to get the $50 prize, but I need to be provided with something
that totally works.  For example if it requires 2 or 3 different scripts
integrated together, you do that part, and provide instructions how we can
install it on a linux machine and get it working. 

Required skills:
willingness to do the above for US$50 total and the ability to start and
finish before December 31, 2008
