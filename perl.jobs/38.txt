Subject: seeking full time perl related employment - North Eastern US/flexible
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: rspier+pja@seas.upenn.edu ((Robert Spier))

 
I'm seeking full time employment, preferably of a Perl nature, at an
interesting and exciting company.  If possible, I'd like to avoid web
work.

I need to be doing serious development and keeping my hands dirty.
Beyond Perl, I'm skilled at several other programming languages
(C,C++,Bourne Shell), and I learn quickly.  If I don't know what you
need, give me a few days.

Past projects I've worked on have included GUI's, web development,
databases, legacy systems, and system and network administration.

Preferred locations include major cities and their neighborhood, on the
east coast, including New York, but I'm open to almost anywhere.

My resume is available at
    http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rspier/resume/

The best way to find me is via email at the address below.
