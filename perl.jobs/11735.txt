Job title:
Web Software Developer for Scotland's leading digital media company

Company name: s1

Internal ID: JJx4

Location: Glasgow, United Kingdom

Pay rate: £depends on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have a great opportunity on s1's in-house technical team for a talented
web applications developer. The role includes server-side web application
programming, mobile applications development, content management systems,
databases, email and SQL for some of Scotland's most successful websites
and online services.

s1 is Scotland's leading internet publisher responsible for the highly
successful s1 series of sites: s1jobs, s1homes, s1cars, s1community and
s1play. We're part of the Herald & Times Group and work closely with our
colleagues on The Herald, Evening Times and Sunday Herald newspapers, and
on their websites such as heraldscotland.com and eveningtimes.co.uk. Our
staff enjoy the benefits of working within a small friendly unit whilst
also being part of a major media company. 

To be considered for this role you must have experience implementing
SQL-based database-driven websites which are available to the general
public, using Perl, PHP, Python or a similar language, preferably using
MySQL databases. Exposure to any of Apache, mod_perl, Linux, SSH, FTP,
memcached, e-commerce, mobile development, MVC, query optimisation or
multiple-server environments would be beneficial. You should also be
comfortable with Javascript and very used to writing and maintaining
Javascript-enabled pages, including Ajax, the DOM, and third party
libraries such as Jquery.

You should have working knowledge of other client-side technologies such as
HTML and CSS, and you combine them with your server programming and
database skills to produce and maintain world-class sites and services.
Essential to this role is a cooperative and professional attitude and
approach. You must be able to work effectively in teams with technical and
non-technical colleagues.

You should be dedicated to elegant solutions and aware how different
technical implementations can bring different benefits to an organisation.
You should be resourceful with web resources, attentive to detail, and have
the initiative to advance your own technical knowledge and skills when
required. If you are comfortable working on both high-level architectures
and low-level algorithm optimisation, and you know which things work well
on s1 websites (see s1thecompany.com for some examples) and how to make
other things work better, then please forward your CV and covering letter
to us through our online application system. In order for your application
to be considered you must detail your experience with the technologies
listed above, including URLs and other information about sites you have
worked on recently which are available to the general public.
