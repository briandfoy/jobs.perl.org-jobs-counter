Description:
Hello,

I have a very small project (probably 4-8 hours) for which I need someone
who knows Perl and JavaScript.

I have some content and I would like to allow other website be able to
publish it on their website.  Here is the issue, the content will always
reside on my server, but I would like the other sites to be able to
maintain their own look and feel, instead of my sites.

What I would like to do is give them a very small code to embed on their
HTML page, which will get content from my server and “publish” it on
theirs.  The code I would like to use is:

	<script src=http://www.site.com/article.js></script>

While the above works well with a single page article, my articles are
multi pages and when users clicks on a link, they are presented with my
site (not the original web site where they got the link from).

So what I need is a script that will do the URL substitution such that when
a link is clicked the CGI will get the new page and deliver it to the
publishing web site.  Also, this script should work with various formats,
including text, html, audio, video and most importantly other CGI programs.


I have some examples that I can provide for you, as I have seen this work
for other sites.

If you can do this, please let me know the time frame and the quote.

Regards,

Ray Masa
