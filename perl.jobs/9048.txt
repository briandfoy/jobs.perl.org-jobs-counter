Job title: Junior Perl Programmer

Company name: Lemcon Networks

Location: Brazil, Barra da Tijuca, Rio De Janeiro

Pay rate: To be discussed

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Long term

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for 2 young trainees who have fairly good perl skills who
are also looking to learn new technologies, in this particular case; 2g and
3g telecommunication technologies. 

To be more specific on the required Perl skills you require is not possible
as it is quite a new venture for us using people with Perl skills. We have
one person at the moment in the USA who knows the 2g and 3g technologies
very well and is also very good with Perl, he is now able to combine those
skills and provide some very useful, time saving and secure programs for
us.

It is now obvious to us that having an engineer with 2g, 3g and Perl skills
is a very good combination of skills to have. However, to find people with
that mixture of skills is highly unlikely so we know we have to train them.
The job involves shift work, it is mostly day work but sometimes afternoons
and sometimes nights.

2g and 3g technologies develop almost on a daily basis and when it does
change we are the ones learning it, configuring it, implementing it and
finding ways to improve it.

Required skills: Perl

Desired skills:
Perl
Unix Basic
XML Basic
Visual Basic for applications Basic
