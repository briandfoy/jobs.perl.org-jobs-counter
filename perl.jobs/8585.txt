Job title:
Experienced Lead Perl developer for SF startup

Company name: SingleFeed

Internal ID: perldev

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
SingleFeed is seeking a senior lead developer with strong previous
experience developing web and/or other applications in Perl. Come join our
small but growing team of developers and help improve and grow SingleFeed's
system as a major contributor. You'll be joining at a time when everyone's
able to make a real difference.

SingleFeed is a web service which enables merchants to effectively market
their goods through shopping search engines such as Google Product Search,
Yahoo! Shopping, Shopzilla, and PriceGrabber by managing and submitting
high quality product data feeds. Each shopping engine has a different
specification for how they want product data feeds to be delivered. Each
shopping engine also has a different algorithm for how they rank products.
SingleFeed provides merchants with a single system in which to manage and
optimize their data feeds.

We have some terrific technical challenges ahead, including large-scale
datasets, complex data feed parsing, auto-scaling components across virtual
servers, architecting a dynamic queueing system, populating a large data
warehouse reporting system, and more.

SingleFeed is a venture-backed start up with real customers and real
revenue. Our office is located in downtown San Francisco. You'll work with
a small team of very smart people who'll talk about the latest tech stuff
one moment and obscure independent music and movies the next.

What we're looking for:

- Experience developing significant software for at least 8 years; you know
about design patterns and anti-patterns, common algorithms, web application
system architecture, and good development practices.
- Many years spent coding substantial applications in Perl. You know all
about Perl subroutines and objects, code re-use, how to debug and profile
apps, and how to make code efficient yet readable and maintainable.
- You've spent a lot of time with CPAN and know a lot of the best packages
so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
- You're perfectly at home in a Linux environment, and you might even have
reasonable experience as a sysadmin.
- Experience working with SQL databases such as MySQL. You can do
multi-table joins in your head and know the difference between inner and
outer joins.
- Experience in other languages like Java and C/C++.
- Your previous team members know that you can take a project and it'll be
done when you said it would be. And not only that but you've tested it
inside and out already. The QA team really likes you.
- You believe strongly in unit testing, good documentation, code reviews,
and working closely with other developers, who like working with you for
those reasons.
- You've worked at startups before, and look forward to working at another
one even though things can be chaotic at times.
- If you're into front-end web development, you might have experience with
Javascript, AJAX, DHTML, and CSS.


If this sounds like you, send a resume and cover letter telling us some
