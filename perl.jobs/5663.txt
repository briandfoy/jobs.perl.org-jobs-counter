Job title:
Senior Perl Web App Developer for web2.0 Startup

Company name: Magnify.net

Location: United States, NY, New York/Telecommute

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3 months to permanent

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Magnify.net is seeking an experienced Perl developer to join our  
web application team.

You will work closely with Magnify's core team to define new features and
identify defects, develop solutions, and deploy them to our live service.

An enthusiastic team, flexible working conditions, and the chance to  
build something unique in a rapidly growing new field combine to make  
this a fantastic opportunity for Perl developers with the requisite  
skills.

Terms: This permanant, full-time position will initially be filled on  
an independent contractor basis, with a reasonable hourly fee or  
weekly retainer. After a few months of contracting, successful hires  
will be given an opportunity to move to a salary basis with benefits  
and options.

Setting: Most of the work we'll require over the next few months can  
be done off-site and on a flexible schedule. (We would be willing to  
consider a pure telecommute arrangement for a stellar candidate, but  
if you're in the New York City area and can periodically meet for  
face-to-face discussions with the rest of the team at our 27th Street  
office, that would be a big plus.)

Required skills:
* Significant knowledge of and experience in Perl programming.	
(Exposure to standard Perl idioms, the ability to create your own  
class hierarchies, and familiarity with CPAN are required.)

* Prior experience in server-side web application development. (You  
should have worked with multiple page templating systems, session  
data storage, relational databases, caching, and inter-process	
communication.)

* Understanding of professional software development processes.  
(Including familiarity with the cycles of requirements definition,  
issue tracking, version control, automated testing, deployment and  
maintenance.)

* Clear and articulate communication, both written and spoken. (Our  
team collaborates extensively by email, IM, and phone, and you will  
need to be able to read specs and write documentation.)

Desired skills:
Prior experience with any or all of the following technologies would  
be a plus:

* Web service operation, scaling, and fault-tolerance using Linux,  
Apache, MySQL, and Perl.

* Our server-side tools include mod_perl, HTML::Mason,	
DBIx::SQLEngine, Cache::Memcached, and other modules from CPAN.

* User interfaces are constructed in HTML with CSS and JavaScript  
(using Prototype and Scriptaculous for Ajax and client-side effects),  
RSS feeds, XML APIs, and client-side Flash widgets.

* Project support tools including RT, SVN, and automated web testing.
