Job title:
Software Engineer - Perl, C, cluster applications.

Company name: Discovery Mining Inc

Location: United States, California, San Francisco

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Discovery Mining is a web-based document management and litigation support
software company. The Discovery Mining IO (input/output) team needs a
talented software engineer driven by the challenges of large-scale projects
and interested in creating cutting-edge, industry-changing applications.

The IO team is responsible for our "back end" processing system which takes
incoming client data and transforms it into a format suitable for our web
site. This process involves file type identification, filtering, text and
metadata extraction as well as the conversion of documents to various image
formats (e.g., TIFF and PDF). The heart of this document processing system
is a high-performance cluster-based application written in Perl, C, and
Java (MySQL is integral to this application). Additional tools are coded in
PHP. Furthermore, the IO team prepares the data to be sent back to our
clients at the end of the case lifecycle and maintains a web interface to
the cluster application that gives our
non-technical project management team the ability to access the system.

As a member of the IO team, you will be asked to work on all aspects of our
back-end systems. The most important language for this position is Perl,
followed by C, Java, and, lastly, PHP.

We offer a desirable benefits package, stock options, and a generous
vacation plan.

Required skills:
* At least 3 years experience as a software engineer writing code in PERL
and C.
* SQL and scripting skills for automation.
* Proficient in working and programming in a UNIX/Linux environment.
* Excellent problem solving abilities with emphasis on performance tuning
and automation of tasks.
* Ability to communicate and interface extensively with the rest of the
team.
* Strong sense of responsibility and ownership of your code.
* Ability to quickly grasp new technologies.

Desired skills:
* JAVA.
* PHP.
