Job title:
ANT/Perl scripter, config manager - Pasadena CA ON-SITE

Company name: CambridgeWebmaster.com

Location: Pasadena, CA

Pay rate: Please tell us your hourly rate

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 3-6 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Please let us know your availability, hourly rates, discount hourly for an
extended project like this that is 3-6 months, and send resume.

If you have friends who are qualified, please have them submit as well. 

Developers must be US based and able to commute to Pasadena, CA.

Client preference is to have 2-4 people in their Pasadena office 9-5
mon-fri for 3-6months, starting next week.  We have a system architect who
will be there managing it, so 2 Junior levels and 2 Seniors are fine.

It may be possible if the person is only there 3 or 4 days a week, and the
people overlap the days they are there.. TBA from client.  The ideal is 9-5
full time on site mon-fri.

We are trying to see if client will let this work remotely with only 1 day
in Pasadena a week... TBA from client, 15% chance. Client's ideal is
full-time on site.

This is a new project, it was just green-lit and contracted. Ideally they'd
love to begin in about a week, if that is possible.

Start: asap, in about a week (if possible). (I am sure that they understand
Holidays put a break in things in 3 weeks).
Duration: 3-6 months
Time: 5 days per week, ideally 9-5 (flexible based on traffic ease)
Location: Pasadena, CA.  On-site mostly, I believe some tele-commuting is
fine.

Skills needed & details of project: ANT/Perl scripting, and configuration
/configuration management.  Will be working on highly secure servers and so
need to know how to do high security stuff.

This is large enterprise software that needs automation.  An example of a
script the architect might ask the developer to do might be, "create a
port, open the port, detect the items, copy what is there, move the items,
rename the items, put items in folder, make 2 copies, push to an ip
address, make sure they got there, have an error system if any issues, and
report back in the end."  It is taking the current 30 hours of manual labor
and simplifying it into a 5 minute script-run process.

This deals with sensitive data, it must be highly secure.  Since it is not
on a cloud server and no VPN access, at least some or all work will be done
On Site.

Required skills: ANT/Perl scripting, configuration management
