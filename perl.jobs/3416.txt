Job title: Intelligent Life Wanted

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, Watertown

Pay rate: depends on experience

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
-question-
A concert has just ended, and the nearby 5-floor parking garage is now
packed with cars trying to leave. Assuming there is no traffic on the
street outside, if you're in a car on the 4th floor, what is your
approximate rate of progress relative to the cars on the first floor?
Relative to cars on the second floor? Why?
-end question-

We're looking for some top-notch folks. Linux hackers, statisticians,
mathematicians-- whatever your persuasion, if you're a smart person with
perl chops, we have a home for you.

You're the kind of person who has always excelled at whatever it is you do,
and can pick up new skills at the drop of a hat. You find it difficult to
turn down a good challenge, and have secretly harbored dreams of either
galactic peace or galactic domination. 

You love working with other excellent people, but are equally comfortable
sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper and molding reality. You know
that you can do the impossible if only you would be given a little bit more
time, but you also know you can accomplish a whole lot more if you work
with trusted colleagues. 

Doing something socially worthwhile is important to you. You may not know a
lot about healthcare now, but you know that it's badly broken; that it's
some insane percentage of our GDP and growing rapidly; and that it's a
problem that you can get passionate about. 

About athenahealth-- we've been around for about 7 years now, and are
located in Watertown, MA (just outside Boston). We've been backed with $40
million in venture capital from A-list VCs-- VCs who provided some of the
original money behind Apple, Home Depot, Intel, Office Depot, Whole Foods,
etc-- but the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise
any more capital. We expect an IPO sometime in the next couple of years,
but for us, it'll just be another milestone, not the seminal event in the
life of the company. 

Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to you. The working
environment is friendly and open. The folks you'll be working with are top
notch, and will probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've
ever worked with regardless of where you're coming from--
Harvard/MIT/Wharton grads, Rand statisticians, former professors, and just
plain smart people who took the road less traveled.

In terms of the work-- we have multiple openings at all levels, from
Performance Engineer to Business Intelligence Analyst to straight-up
Application Developer. In all cases, you'll be working with lots of
open-source technologies and will get exposure to what it's like to build
and run a mission-critical web application on a farm of Linux boxen. You'll
also gain a deep appreciation for what it's like to build, sell, and
operate a world-class business-to-business service. 

If you're interested, we'd love to hear from you. Please send your resume
and an answer to the above question to puzzles@athenahealth.com, and we can
start talking.
