Job title: Web developer/database applications

Location: United States, DC, Washington

Pay rate: $55,000 per year

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This job is at the data collection arm of a publisher for the financial
services industry. We conduct quarterly surveys of mortgage lenders.
Currently the surveys are by fax and phone with the data going into an
Access database. Your assignment, if you choose to implement is to
co-design, implement and manage the transition from this early-1990s
technology to a web/email based, highly automated system.

Informal training will be provided as needed, although sometimes you will
be required to RTFM. 

We are a remote and godforsaken office of a large New York corporation, so
we get away with a lot here. The atmosphere is laid-back, you can dress
casually and you'll have an office of your own. The benefits are good:
medical, dental, vision and life insurance, 401(k), three weeks of paid
vacation and tuition reimbursement, free coffee, free popcorn and
subsidized sodas.

The office is near Metro Center.

Required skills:
Perl, CGI, HTML, CSS, ability to correctly spell the word 'mortgage'

Desired skills:
Microsoft Access, XML, database management
