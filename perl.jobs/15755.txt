Description:
Software Engineer (Perl Programmer)

Do you want to watch clinical
technology change, or do you want to be the one to shape it?
Because we’re
hoping you’re here for the latter.
 

Who are we?

We are 12,000+ employees
strong, operating in more than 85 countries.  We are committed to saving
lives and we are constantly striving to be the best at what we do.  Our
impact is real and we see it every single day.	We help get life-saving
drugs into the hands of those who need them most.
 

Who are you?

You are
a forward thinker.  You are an innovator that refuses to settle.  The idea
of using your coding skills to build applications that will be used towards
improving the lives of others excites you.  You want to push the boundaries
and change not just what it means to be a Software Engineer; you want to
change the future.  You want to learn from the best, grow your knowledge
and your skill set, and you want to build your career.	You want to use the
latest technology and tools in the industry to push the momentum of an
already growing company forward.  You want to find a balance that still
lets you be, well, you.  Most of all, you want to do it in a place where
you’re more than an employee number…a place you love working.
 
Still here?
 Good.	If this is you, we’d really like to meet you.  Let’s build things.


What will you be doing?

Working in a global team environment to build and
optimize complex, custom software applications.  We’re taking a fresh
approach at ways that technology and analytics can empower those working in
the clinical life-cycle and shape the future of clinical development.


What do you need to have?

At least 2 years of experience with
object-oriented Perl; working as a professional developer in a
collaborative team environment.
Demonstrated experience working with
object-oriented design and development.
Experience building multi-tiered
web applications.
Extensive experience with LAMP/ Linux environment and
tools.
Experience developing database-driven applications.
Excellent verbal
and written communication skills.
BS in Computer Science or equivalent or
working towards a BS degree.
