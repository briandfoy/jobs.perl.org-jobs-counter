The University of Wisconsin, Madison is looking for another programmer
for the Network Services Application Programming Group. We mostly do
system automation to scrape router configs and show output, simple web

departments manage their switches, and backend stuff on a LAMP stack.
We are mostly Perl with some bash, MySQL, RHEL/CentOS Linux, and
python.

Required skills:
DoIT Network Applications develops, maintains and operates the software
used by Network Services and campus Authorized Agents to automate,
configure, maintain and monitor the network. The software is mostly Perl,
MySQL and CGI, but we will consider developers with experience in other
languages. This is a senior position, and you must have experience creating
and maintaining multiple medium to large systems in the above environment.
The work hours are mostly flexible daytime, but some off hour support might
be required as noted in the job posting.

Strong skills in Perl, moderate to strong skills in Linux, Apache, MySQL,

large systems relied on by many users.
