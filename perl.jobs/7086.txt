Job title:
Quality Assurance Engineer for Wireless Management Software

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, California, San Mateo

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
AirWave Wireless, Inc., wants to add a QA Engineer to its growing quality
assurance team. AirWave makes software that manages large wireless networks
and is used by Fortune 500 companies, universities and major healthcare
organizations. You can learn more about our product at
http://www.airwave.com.

We practice agile development, which means that QA has a lot of
opportunities to be involved in product development, planning and design.
Experience with agile development (or extreme programming) would be nice,
but we’re willing to work with the right new hire to get him or her up to
speed. We’re pushing to add more automation to our process, so experience
in that area is a plus, especially with Perl (we are an all-Perl shop). 
And if you enjoy doing hands-on work with hardware devices you'll be a
great fit in our QA team.

We're looking for someone who is detail-oriented, an advocate for the
customer and eager to jump in and learn our product. We're also looking for
someone who has solid experience writing test plans and documenting bugs,
and can provide us with examples of their past work. If you think you’re
the right person, please send your resume and a cover letter that lets us
know why you’re a good fit.

Required skills:
Perl scripting
Linux/Unix
Solid ability to document bugs and write test plans


Desired skills:
Experience with wireless devices
Ability to automate testing
Experience in an agile development environment
