Job title: perl XS module developer

Company name: Plixer International

Location: United States, ME, Sanford

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
Do you know perlguts?  We are looking for someone to help speed up a perl
application.  The application runs as a service/daemon and processes large
volumes of structured binary data.

Project overview:
  Initial:
    * Develop set of utility functions coded in C (spec provided)
    * bundle functions as a module
    * must run on Win32, Win64 and Linux (32 and 64)
    * module must also have option to install pure perl versions of the
functions
      * perl versions provided

  Future:
    This project has the potential to expand depending on what we learn
from this.  Possible additional work include
      * Help profiling
      * [re]design consulting (on site preferred)
	* add parallel processing  (threads? processes?) 
      * XS implementations of modules on CPAN (POE-XS-Loop-Select? or
other)
      * extensions to core perl functions (unpack needs more features...)

Software:
ActiveState perl 5.10 (or newer if required)
C compiler
* Windows MSVC 6
* Linux gcc

Windows and/or Linux logins can be provided if needed.

Confidential:
Details are available on this project once we have a signed NDA with
interested contractors.

perlguts expertise
perl XS

MySQL
