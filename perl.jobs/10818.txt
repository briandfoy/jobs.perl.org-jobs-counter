Job title: Perl consultant / tutor

Company name: None yet

Location: United States, California, Palo Alto

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: To be determined

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
I am looking for someone to help me understand what Perl can do and decide
if it's the right tool for a number of tasks I need to complete. Then, if
it is the right tool, help me get started using it for a few scripting and
simulation chores.

The immediate tasks are desktop scripts for Win XP for (a) handle routine
chores such as file management and (b) general simulation tasks.

I have used Rexx for 20 years for these tasks, but it does not have good
GUI tools. I am looking for a language that is easy to use, like Rexx, but
has (a) better tools for creating GUI user forms and (b) good tools for
interfacing with a database.

Required skills:
Broad general knowledge of Perl as a macro language and for scripting and
simulation tasks.

Good English, good commuication skills, ability to explain things clearly
and succinctly.

Desired skills:
Experience with Rexx.

Experience as tutor / teacher.
