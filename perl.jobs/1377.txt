Job title:
Web Developer (Perl/XML/JavaScript) - CONTRACT POSITION

Company name: Effective Educational Technologies

Location: United States, MA, Cambridge

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
EET is a small but growing educational technology company delivering
web-based learning and assessment products to college-level students and
instructors in the sciences. We are currently seeking a skilled and
adaptive contract programmer for 2 or 3 short-term projects with the
possibility of a longer-term engagement in the future. We offer a friendly,
informal environment, reasonably competitive rates, and an early-stage
opportunity to become a part of a leading organization in a rapidly
expanding industry. 

The ideal candidate will be highly adept in Perl and should have a strong
background in XML and in the practical application of XML-related
technologies. Prior experience with Altova Authentic (esp. the Browser
Edition) is a plus. Also very valuable are advanced JavaScript skills as
well as a solid knowledge of HTML and SQL. A high level of comfort with
Linux -- and open source platforms/tools in general -- is also desired. 

You must be able to write well-organized, well-commented, maintainable code
under the direction/review of one or more lead developers. You must be able
to identify, locate, and resolve code issues efficiently and be able to
work independently while adhering to specific guidelines. Special
consideration may be given to applicants with a background in advanced
mathematics, physics, or other sciences, however this is not a requirement.


You will be expected to work between 30 and 40 hours per week, most of it
on-site at our Central Square office in Cambridge, MA.	We are just steps
from the Red Line and several bus routes.  The hourly rate will be
commensurate with your experience/aptitude in the core requirements of the
job.

Required skills: Perl, XML, SQL

Desired skills: JavaScript, HTML, Altova Authentic
