Description:
We are doing a research project and wish to find a developer who can help
us map out IP addresses that are being used as proxies. Companies who have
open proxies are leaving themselves open to abuse, we wish to figure out
with perl how many open proxies are out there and how large the problem is.
Email me for the specifics. Writing the script that finds open proxies pays
