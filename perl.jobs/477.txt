Job title:
OO Perl / mod_perl programmer for Web CMS

Company name: Webarchitects

Location: United Kingdom, Sheffield

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hi,

  I'm currently looking for a Perl / mod_perl programmer to help developing
our application MKDoc.

  The application was originally a CGI script which has been made
Apache::Registry friendly later on. We are currently gradually porting the
software under proper mod_perl handlers.

  Given the fact that the codebase is now more than 2 years old, and that
the application is doing a lot more that it was ever meant to do, being
able to work with existing code and write test script suites is important.
Refactoring to the rescue!

  Our company aims at making the CMS which produces the best websites in
terms of usability, accessibility and standards compliance. And lately,
unicode support, including right to left languages. So if you like these
words and if you love Object Oriented Perl, this job is for you!

Send me resumes and code snippets!

Required skills:
OO Perl, mod_perl, DBI


Desired skills: XS
