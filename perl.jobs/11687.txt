Job title: Web Developer (Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Internal ID: Perl360

Location: USA

Pay rate: $50/hour USD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
A few successful entrepreneurs want you to build web applications.  We've
got a start on things, but we need more help!

This is a very casual work arrangement.  Work at home, keep the hours that
work best for you.  No travel necessary.  Payments are made quickly and via
wire transfer to your bank.

This group is stable and already has stable income.  Help us build the next
big thing and use some cutting-edge technology in the process.

Required skills:
We use Ubuntu Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl.

You should be able to login via ssh, connect to the database and restart
apache.

Some past experience programming with Perl, PHP, Python or Ruby.

You should be competent using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Nothing fancy, but
we do layout with divs and css, not tables.  We use jQuery but aren't
overly-fanatical about it.

Desired skills:
We use the Amazon Cloud (AWS) so if you have checked it out that would be
great.	Otherwise we'll bring you up to speed.
