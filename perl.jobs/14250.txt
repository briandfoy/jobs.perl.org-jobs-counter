Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Capital One (SparkPay)

Location: San Francisco, CA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
About The Job: Looking for three junior software engineers to develop
internal applications. You'll be working on the full-stack for web apps and
infrastructure (ETL stuff). There's also some medium to large-scale data
science problems to chew on. We have legacy systems in Perl and R, so
you'll be using those and whatever other languages you find useful. You
will come to work excited and go home exhausted. 

About The Team: We are a mobile payments startup that has been acquired by
a large national bank (Capital One). Blending the two cultures has been
exhilarating and, at times, frustrating. As banks go, Capital One is
arguably the most progressive one in the market. The organization is
constantly evolving, which creates endless career opportunities if you step
up and seize them. 

About Me: I've been developing software for a long time, including some
notable projects in the Perl community. And I still write a lot of open
source code. I'll be your partner and coach as you learn the ropes. I plow
the road so you can keep moving forward. We'll be pairing, scrumming, and
whatever else it takes to get the job done. 

About You: Be curious, be humble, be lazy (in the good way), and be
scrappy. Above all, you must play well with others. Be mindful of what you
don't know. Have some FOSS work to show us. If you don't have any FOSS of
your own, then show us some that you like and tell us why you like it. Be
ready to ask questions, get dirty, and make mistakes. 

Must be present to win. Remote work is not an option.
