Job title: Dynamic Voter Driven Search Engine

Company name: Vision Impact LLC

Location: United States, UT, Saint George 

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Big vision to start with a single county in the state of Utah (USA). The
vision will allow online users to first search for any service, business
etc. within their county or local area (zip code, voting precinct or the
like), and add a written comment about the business with a simple thumbs up
and a thumbs down tool. Users can then find the better quality business or
service as defined by user themselves and not paid listings. At the top of
the found search listing is the business placed their by voters. There is
more vision to come in stages and must be willing to sign a non disclosure
agreement. This is eventually a large project that will eventually
manipulate huge amounts of text (great for Perl). Once one county is up and
running with written content with up or down votes, all deciding the
ranking of things, we will move to a five county area and beyond. It gets
very big after this. 

Required skills:
Perl, as I understand, is the best for manipulating huge blocks of text.
Other programing languages a plus. I am a former college English teacher
turned into an entrepreneur. I am not a programer. 

Desired skills:
Webdevelopment, graphic design (nothing busy), and love for the job and its
vision.
