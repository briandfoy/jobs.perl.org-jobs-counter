Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Bluehost

Location: Orem, UT

Pay rate: BOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Bluehost Perl Developer will be part of our billing/payments
development team building the next generation billing system. The team has
high visibility in the company and is important for our ongoing success.
All billing systems within our parent company will be migrated to this
system. You will be one of the core developers who will help deliver on the
product vision.

Required skills:
Talented Perl programmer -- You have been around the block a few times and
are comfortable using Perl to make web apps work.

Object Oriented Perl -- You think Perl is more than "just a scripting
language" and know how to make it do things others can't. Plus you
understand how Perl's object orientation differs from other languages such
as C# and Java. That said, we are open to talking to you even if you don't
have Perl in your background, but have deep experience with object oriented
development.

SQL Database Expertise -- Our billing system is built on PostgreSQL. A SQL
background is extremely valuable to the success of this project.

Web Experience -- You are familiar with how the web works, and can hit the
ground running writing web applications and tools.

Open source world -- You have lived in open source code for most or a good
part of your career and are not a fan of the commercial software world. For
example, you have no problem using Vim or Emacs as your "IDE" for Perl.

Team Player -- You work well as part of a team, and are willing to take
direction, but can be trusted to get things done on your own.

Hard Working -- Once you get your bearings, you are heads-down and
tenacious in completing assigned projects.

Must be qualified to work in the United States. We have no Visas for you. 

Position is located in Orem, UT. Must be willing to relocate.

Desired skills:
At least 5 years experience as an object oriented Perl developer

Must be competent developing Web applications and system utilities

Must be competent with SQL

Must have experience with internet payments; billing systems is even better
!!!

Must be knowledgeable with Linux and basic system administration

Ability to stay on task, solve problems, and accomplish tasks in a timely
manner

Able to work well with other team members
