Job title:
QA Engineer for Wireless Management Software

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, California, San Mateo

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:

AirWave Wireless, Inc., in San Mateo, California is looking for a QA
Engineer to join our growing team. AirWave builds software that manages
wireless networks, and the QA group is responsible for testing, validating
and improving our product. We practice agile development, which means that
QA works closely with software engineers during short, two-week coding
cycles. Rather than extensive written documentation, we rely on
conversations and collaboration with engineers and product managers to
determine testing framework.

A typical day in QA might find you writing framework for automation tests,
fresh-installing a server with Red Hat Linux and telneting into a wireless
access point in our test lab, as well as writing test plans and doing
manual and regression testing. An ideal candidate would be naturally
inquisitive, willing to dive in and learn our product, and a strong
troubleshooter who is comfortable working independently. 

You can learn more about our company and our product at
http://www.airwave.com. Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task,
but our products help to ease that burden. We build network management
software that is used by many of the leading IT organizations at Fortune
500 companies, major universities, hospitals, and other prominent
institutions. Our industry-leading software helps plan, configure, manage,
and monitor some of the largest wireless networks on the planet.

If you’re interested, please send a resume and a cover letter the the
linked email - make sure to tell us why you're interested in the position,
and why you think you're a good fit. We are looking forward to hearing from
you! 

Required skills:
A background in Perl (we are an all-Perl development shop), SQL, Linux or
networking protocols like SNMP or TFTP would be a plus, as is experience
writing automation tests. A keen eye for detail and a meticulous approach
to your job is essential.
