Job title:
Perl/Catalyst full-time junior web developer

Company name: Cosbit Technologies

Location: Canada, Alberta, Calgary

Pay rate:
$18-22/hr plus revenue share program after initial assessment period

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
- Are you becoming lost, feeling like just another number working at a
large company?
- Are you looking to get back to having some fun at work?
- Are you intrigued by the opportunity to "live & learn" in an
entrepreneurial environment, producing and delivering excellent product for
interesting clients?

Cosbit Technologies is a rapidly growing web application development firm
with head office in Calgary, Alberta, and an office opening Fall 2008 in
Ottawa, Ontario.

This opening is for a Calgary resident (no telecommuters, please) looking
to become an expert broad-spectrum web application developer. While the
initial commitment is for a 90-day assessment period, we are looking to
foster a long-term relationship. Employment can be immediate.

Your workstation will include dual 20" LCD screens, since two heads are
better than one. We develop in Perl using the Komodo IDE, and knowledge of
Subversion and bits of SQL will certainly come in handy. Modules we use
frequently include HTML::Mason, Catalyst, Moose, DBIx::Class,
Image::Magick, Perl::Critic, Perl::Tidy, jQuery, and Taconite.

Working with us you will learn standards-based, best-practice coding
techniques for web application development. Our trade is our craft and our
work is done right -- no cutting corners. Pay is based on merit. Starting
wage for this position is $18-$22/hr. Pay review occurs every 6 months. We
have a very competitive revenue-sharing program for full-time positions
(after the assessment period).

As we grow, if you work hard with us along the way, you will have the
opportunity to produce more, get more money, and increase your
responsibility to being a team leader.

Our office environment is relatively informal, though clients will stop by
from time to time (shorts, t-shirt & sandals are okay, good personal
hygiene is requisite). Hours are flexible, though we expect the majority of
your time to be spent between Monday to Friday, during normal office hours.
Full-time means you are expected to commit 35-40 hours a week.


Required skills:
Since we're small, you should be willing to extend yourself as a "Jack of
all trades". Ideally you have, or are working towards, a B.Sc. or
equivalent. Any experience in web application development, or software
development in general, is an asset. You should be willing to become an
expert at HTML and CSS, DOM manipulation, AJAX development including
XSS+CSRF defenses, and object-oriented Javascript. You should be
comfortable with Photoshop basics (or being willing to learn quickly).
While web application development will be your primary focus, your daily
tasks will occasionally involve network, hardware, and systems
administration, if that's what needs to get done.


Desired skills:
Our infrastructure includes many open-source tools such as Perl, Linux
(Ubuntu and CentOS), Apache, FastCGI, BIND, SSH, Subversion, Pure-FTPd,
Postfix, and PostgreSQL. Familiarity with these back-end tools as well as
various client platforms and browsers, including Windows and Mac OS X,
Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Opera, is a definite asset.
