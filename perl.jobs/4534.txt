Description:
Looking for just another mod_perl hacker.  Given your choice of anything to
do, you would choose hacking mod_perl.	It's fun after all, lets you do
what you want and stays out of your way.

Your testing package of choice is Apache::Test.  You know how to send your
own headers with responses.  You have contributed to mod_perl in some way,
shape, or form.  You know what to do with each phase of the HTTP request
cycle.	

This is a contractor position with a company of smart people going beta
soon with a disruptive product.  We offer competitive pay and the chance to
work on a cool mod_perl based service.	We also give back to the mod_perl,
Perl, and ASF communities.

Look forward to hearing from you!
