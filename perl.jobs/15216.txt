Job title: Head of IT / CTO

Company name: Eligo Recruitment

Location: Manchester, UK

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Head of IT / CTO (Perl Focused) 
Area – Manchester  
Salary – Negotiable 

Whose Hiring 

A data driven business who are play a vital role in
developing start-up’s and SME’s to achieve a greater market share in
whatever business area they are in. I’ve never seen a company invest in
their staff in the way this company does. There are over 300 people (Not
all tech) but the CEO knows everyone by name and their background. As you
will be seated at your desk a large proposition of the day, the company
have spent £400 per chair, unless you are the CEO and you make do! For all
those Coffee drinkers out there – The Company have installed the best
coffee machines money can buy!	If you like the sound of this staff focused
company then read on 

Tech Culture 

The technology stack is completely
Perl and although as you can imagine the majority of the Perl code is
legacy they have no plans to switch platforms and are keen to be a real
influence within the Perl community over the next few years. They have
recently switched from using catalyst to Mojolicious. The tech culture if
the technology exist there is no need to reinvent the wheel and lets buy or
using it. As with what I have already mentioned the company invest heavily
in the machines they use, everything it top of the line. They want to be
the leading players in the world in their tech space, The App for their
product is pushing the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence and feel they
can really add something to the tech space. It’s hard to explain how
advanced they are without using the cliché “ahead of the game”. The CEO has
stated we will have a base in Silicon Valley competing with the larger tech
company in 3 years – You will be the driving force behind this! And it will
be all run from the newly built £14 Million pound office in Manchester!  

What type of Person 

When I spoke with the CEO about What type of Person,
The answer I got was I want the best! I want someone who has ideas, who has
passion for technology. I want someone who isn’t going to settle for second
best. I want someone who wants in a couple of years to be driving a £100k
car and commanding a £250k plus salary. The role won’t start there but If
the person is right it will get there. He continued and said I want someone
who Eats, Sleeps and breathes new technology. If there is a fantastic
product out there and he can enhance our business then I want to use it and
I need this person to know about it.  They need to have a Perl Development
background, need ideally to have managed people before although team is
only 5 in size at moment, They are hiring for 2 x Senior Perl Developers, 
2 2 x Jnr/Mid-level Perl Developers, and 2 x Linux System Admins, so its
helpful if you have managed/lead teams before. However the CEO said if they
are a talented Senior Perl developer and they can command respect for
people then that’s perfect. It’s about being confident sat in front of a
multi-million area Hedge fund owner and saying “I know it’s always been
done this way, but it should be done this way because……” The CEO said Can I
put this person in front of the biggest players in Silicon Valley and have
them command respect?, So in short I need an experienced Perl Developer
(Ideally 5 years plus), who can lead the charge in working with an
internally renowned owner who want to grow aggressively, They need the
vision and the passion to carry the responsibility. The role isn’t for the
faint hearted most will fail but the cream always rises to the top , the
best will succeed and enjoy a long, profitable and tech focused career.
