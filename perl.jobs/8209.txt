Job title: Perl Developer, Team Lead (software)

Company name: Solomon Page Technology Partners

Location: United States, NY, New York

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our client is the leading developer of database management automation
software. The server side of their flagship product is heavy on
object-oriented Perl; 5.8.7 is supported (although we might migrate to 5.10
on all supported platforms once it is burned in).  As far as coding
conventions, we use PBP and peer review (use strict; and use warnings; are
mandatory). Warnings are fatal (causing a die to occur). All code must
compile on all supported platforms prior to commit (Linux, Solaris, Win32,
HP-UX, etc.).

Required skills:
Obviously you have an unbridled love of Perl. Additionally, you’ll offer:
 
•	Significantly skilled with Perl (C++, PHP receive bonus points) 
•	Solid experience in TCP/IP network and/or distributed systems
programming 
•	Working with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL 
•	Fluency in Linux and/or flavors of UNIX 
•	Team lead experience would be very nice to have
