Description:
As we continue to create better ways to provide value to our customers, we
have a rare opportunity for you to join a small team within one of our
fastest-growing divisions. Translation: start-up feel without the start-up

In this role, you’ll be a part of a team that architects, develops and
maintains customer-facing applications. You’ll be tasked to migrate legacy
Perl code to more cutting-edge frameworks such as Plack (similar to Ruby’s
Rack), Mason and Mouse. You’ll also be developing Javascript-based widget
application frameworks using jQuery and backbone. We are looking for
candidates capable of taking a technological idea from inception to
production. We're passionate about web performance development and we
strive to stand out among the best of the best. Join the team and we’ll
expect nothing less from you.


Required skills:
In your toolkit will be: 
• PERL: OO Perl, plus Plack, Mason and Moose
• javaScript: Modern libraries such as JQuery, underscore.js, backbone.js 
• SQL for MySQL/Oracle backend database storage/access 


Desired skills:
• HTML5, AJAX, DOM, JSON, CSS
• Understanding of data driven API’s
• Linux including Apache web server
• MVC – Model View Controller based architecture 
• Module Based Architecture
