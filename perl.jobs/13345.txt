Location: Gatwick, UK

Pay rate: £40-60k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
Thermeon are looking for an experienced system administrator to join its
team.
As a market leading technology company providing software and services
globally to the car rental industry, we take pride in our long history of
innovation and excellent customer service.
Thermeon has offices in the UK, Australia and USA, with sales and support
staff, developers and system administrators around the world. In support of
our systems we run a global network of servers and infrastructure. A wide
range of services and solutions means candidates must be adaptable, quick
learners, and able to handle diverse and complex infrastructures. You'll be
working with other system adminstrators globally to maintain and grow our
systems, and develop new solutions to scale our services to meet new
challenges and growth.
The successful candidate should have at least 4 years experience managing
networks of linux servers. A strong understanding of virtualisation,
replication and redundancy is important.
You should enjoy learning and exploring new technologies and applying them
to real world problems. Candidates must be able to plan, document, test and
implement solutions either in isolation or as part of a team. Clear
communication and a helpful attitude are important for candidates to work
with the rest of the company. You must take pride in the systems you
manage, and the solutions you deliver.
You should be used to working to deadlines, manage your time, and report
project statuses to interested parties.
Candidates should be experienced with working in conjunction with a
development team to help deploy, manage and scale web applications, and the
databases, caches and related services which support them. You should have
experience writing scripts and programs to help with all your
responsibilities.

This role is based in our UK Gatwick office, but telecommuting is an option
for candidates in the UK with a track record of successfully working
remotely in the past, have a suitable environment free from distractions,
and are available to travel to the Gatwick based UK office when necessary.

Required skills:
Linux administration (Both Debian and Redhat)
Network and VPN administration
