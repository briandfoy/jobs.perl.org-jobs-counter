Job title:
Perl Programmer for leading book distributor

Company name: Follett Library Resources

Location: United States, IL, McHenry

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Follett Library Resources, the leading distributor of books and other media
to schools around the world, has an immediate IT opening for a Senior
Programmer. As our tremendous success continues, driven by our innovative
website, we are seeking a smart, curious, positive professional to do great
things in our web-programming department.

As a Senior Programmer, you'll be involved at all project phases:
requirements, design, estimation, construction, and rollout. Seniors not
only write great code, but also work with project analysts to define
requirements, lead project teams, help to guide the other programmers, and
participate in setting the technical direction of the department. No
wizards who like to code in a closet need apply!

We use Perl (the most fun you can have writing code), with a touch of PHP,
for a 3-tier web application running on Apache, with Oracle as the backend,
all hosted on Linux. We take life-long learning seriously and always look
for new technologies to add to our bag of tricks. Our rapid growth
guarantees you will not be bored. We are agile, productive, and do our
magic through short project cycles. We’re a tightly knit team, we think
programming is fun, take great pride in our accomplishments, and we don’t
work sweatshop hours.


Required skills:
&#61623; At least five years applications programming experience.
&#61623; Minimum one year of web application development. 
&#61623; Fluency in Perl, including object-oriented-ness.
&#61623; Familiarity with at least one other high-level object-oriented
language (Java, C++, Python, Ruby, etc). 
&#61623; HTML, SQL, and basic database design. Experience with automated
testing and source code control.
&#61623; Excellent written and verbal communication skills. 

Business acumen, RDBMS administration, and leading teams are all big
pluses!
