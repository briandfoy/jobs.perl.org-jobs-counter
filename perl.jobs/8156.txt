Job title:
Rewrite of the asterisk plugin for munin graphing

Company name: Jan Prunk

Location: Slovenia, Ljubljana

Pay rate: 20 EUR

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 2 hours

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hello !

I would like to hire someone to do a quick fix of the asterisk perl script,
which is used on munin http://munin.sourceforge.net graphing system. The
script is expected to work with older asterisk release 1.2, and I allready
have asterisk 1.4. which makes the script unusable. I think that the fix
itself can be done in less than 2 hours by an experienced perl programmer.
I will provide you with the asterisk plugins.

Required skills: perl coding

Desired skills:
knowledge of asterisk and munin are a bonus
