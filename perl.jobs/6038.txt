Job title: Telecommute Perl Developer/Golfer

Company name: name withheld

Location: United States, Remotely, Work

Pay rate: $35-60 / hr, DOQ

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
This is an hourly contract position with an initial anticipated duration of
90 days.  The number of hours per week will be at least 20, but if your
qualifications/availability/productivity warrant, we will approve you to
work up to 60 hours/week.  Which hours you work are extremely flexible, but
your manager must know your anticipated schedule with some accuracy 48
hours prior.  Payment terms will be weekly by hours invoiced, or
prenegotiated/estimated by milestone/subproject if you demonstrate high
reliability.  Contract can be terminated at-will by either party at any
time, but we plan to keep you by offering you high incentives to stay if
you're good enough.

This is primarily a re-implementation project of an existing architecture,
but you will have wide latitude in design choices in many areas. 
Development tasks will include:
1. replacing existing mysql schemas with sqlite, with emphasis on optimal
efficiency, somewhat duplicating current functionality but with many
changes.
2. replacing existing CGI.pm scripts with a markup emitter of your choice:
Jifty, Catalyst, or your own pet framework that's gpl2 compatible and meets
our resource usage requirements.  Rewrite reports and other interfaces to
match your new model/schema.
3. refactoring existing qpsmtpd plugins for a more flexible adaptive
weighting system and add some more amavisd-new-ish functionality via some
new plugins.
4. browser markup/style design, if you want.  entirely optional.

Development standards will include:
1. use whatever development methodology (test-driven, extreme, JFDI) suits
you.  You'd better be able to explain it, at least concisely.
2. use our SVN repository early and often.  Use SVK/darcs/git or whatever
at your end if you like.
3. use as many existing modules/packages as is beneficial.  Publish your
work as new modules if your work can be abstracted as such.  Report/fix
bugs in existing public modules as you discover them.
4. Use whatever tools/languages/libraries help you get the job done the
fastest with the product being the most efficient, as long as it's free and
open-source and we can get or build packages for the various distributions
we support.
5. Report daily on your activities/accomplishments for the past day, your
activities/goals for the next day, and an updated weekly milestone roadmap
if needed.  No BS such as "trying to install perl module X" or "figuring
out some new editor macro system".

Required skills:
Perl, SQL, XHTML, software engineering, personal time management, project
task prioritization by dependency, excellent communication skills,
compiling/packaging.

Desired skills:
Async I/O (event loop, non-blocking), HTML/CSS design skills highly
optional, extreme brilliance.
