Job title:
Senior Web Developer, interesting projects, pleasant environment

Company name: TigerLead Solutions

Location: United States, MI, Ann Arbor

Pay rate: competitive salary or hourly equivalent

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
TigerLead Solutions is a leading provider of internet marketing services
and proprietary lead management software to successful Realtors throughout
North America. Our work involves manipulating and warehousing external data
feeds and developing web interfaces to create home search tools for
prospective buyers and lead management tools for real estate agents.

The environment here and in our company headquarters in Los Angeles is
casual with no bureaucracy. The Ann Arbor office is located in a new
building one block from the University of Michigan central campus. The
office environment is extremely comfortable and dedicated to our
engineering team only. The company is in its fourth year, growing steadily,
and able to offer both stability as well as the opportunity for the right
person to make an immediate impact on new projects. 

We would prefer a full-time commitment but would also consider a part-time
or contractor.	Telecommuting would be a possibility after significant time
in Ann Arbor getting integrated into the team.

Compensation is competitive and commensurate with skill set and experience.
Benefits for full-time employees include medical coverage, paid holidays
and personal days, paid monthly parking if needed, paid professional
development opportunities, and a casual work environment including dual
monitors and a fast computer at your desk, no dress code, and an extremely
nice group of folks as your co-workers. 


Required skills:

We're looking for a skilled coder to join our small team of talented
engineers in Ann Arbor. We hope to find an experienced programmer who is a
good fit with our team, well-versed in multiple languages, able to learn
quickly and work independently. We work in a Linux environment, and tools
and languages we use include Perl, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and GIT. Perl
experience is a significant plus, but your current comfort level with any
of these specific tools is less important than overall technical aptitude
and ability to learn quickly and fit in well with the current team.
