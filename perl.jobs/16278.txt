Job title: Backend / Infrastructure Developer

Company name: ReCollect

Location: Internet, must reside in Canada

Pay rate: $60k-$80k CAD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Apply To Position
Apply Using LinkedIn

We'd like you to join our
development team and help us build delightful civic technologies for
hundreds of cities across North America.

As an intermediate-level
developer on our Platform Team, you'll help evolve and scale our API
platforms, automated builds and other microservices. You'll use some of the
latest technologies, you'll share your experiences and wisdom building
usable services, and you'll get your hands dirty as we maintain existing
services and build new ones.

You'll have great peers to work with - folks
who will understand the challenges we face and will help you grow and get
where we need to be. Our development team is geographically distributed,
and has many, many years of telecommute experience and working on
drama-free, highly productive teams.

This listing is for a full-time
position, based anywhere in Canada. We are looking for Intermediate level
candidates who have some experience but are looking to grow and make an
impact.

Full position description can be found here:
https://recollect.breezy.hr/p/0fbd75b8e64d-infrastructure-developer

Desired skills:
What We Are Looking For
The right person for this job will have a few years
experience in building and maintaining secure, modern web services. You'll
have hard won lessons and experience scaling and evolving systems and you
can jump into different code bases easily.

You'll be a polyglot - someone
comfortable in several languages - who is comfortable fixing backend APIs,
updating terraform configs, or updating our build systems. You won't be
scared off by the need to explore a large code base to fix bugs and learn
how things work.

Ideally, you'll have experience working on an entirely
distributed team. You'll understand how to keep yourself productive, happy
and healthy while working from your home-office or co-working space. When
we get together a couple times a year for all-hands face-to-face, you'll
value the time with your awesome peers!

You'll have a lot to share and
teach, and also a desire to learn and grow. We are all about learning and
getting smarter as we build ReCollect! By the end of your (hopefully long)
career at ReCollect, you will be happy, healthy and have lots of new
lessons and learnings to share.

You must be prepared for hard work with
our small team, as we continue to explore new markets and customer
segments. You will need to be comfortable helping us grow and modify our
processes and making decisions to keep our future options as open as
possible. You should also be prepared to occasionally carry the weight for
others and take on tasks outside of your typical responsibilities when
needed.

We will support you with:

A stable and friendly development
process and team. (Regular blame-free retrospectives, little-a agile,
kanban)
A clear vision of where we want and need to get to. (Stable
strategic priorities, no giant swings in the idea du jour)
A delightful
coding environment and tools.
Documentation on how existing systems work.
(Confluence, Google Docs, code commenting. Not perfect but always
improving)
A reliable test automation system. (Unit & integration testing,
Selenium & Cypress.io, Jenkins)
Excellent communication & dev tools.
(Slack, Github, Pivotal Tracker, Join.me, Hangouts, tmux, Sauce Labs, ...)
Peers with many years of development experience.
You will have experience
with these technologies:

RESTful HTTP APIs
Amazon Web Services
Open Source
technologies: (nginx, haproxy, memcached, ...)
Dynamic languages (Perl,
Node, Ruby, Bash)
Static languages (eg: golang)
You know your UTF8 from
your L18N and your L10N
Serverless architectures


And ideally will have:

Strong written communication skills
Strong command line skills
Experience
working on build and automation systems
Experience with mobile app
architectures
Experience in a Civic Tech project or community group
Our
customers are mostly local government organizations, and you'll get to
interact with them and help provide the legendary customer service that we
have become known for.

Most importantly, we want you to be bright and fun.
We also want you to care about a greener planet, happy citizens, and more
efficient governments.
