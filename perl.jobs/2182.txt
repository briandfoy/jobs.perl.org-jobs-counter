Job title:
mod_perl/MySQL/Linux/Apache contractors needed

Company name: Incentive Logic, Inc

Location: United States, Arizona, Scottsdale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 to 6 months minimum

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hello fellow Perlers,

I am posting this listing on behalf of my employer, not as a recruiter.  

We currently need two or three contractors to assist our development team
with various client-facing projects.  Duration is 3 to 6 months, to start
ASAP.	There's a good possibility that there could be a full time position
at the end of the contract.

The positions involve creating customized functionality to our existing
web-based application system, for specific clients. The environment is
Linux, Apache, mod_perl, and MySQL.

We need strong Perl coders, with heavy web-based application experience (as
opposed to mainly system administration experience) in a team environment.
Some mod_perl experience is a major plus.

Position is based in Scottsdale Arizona (Phoenix area) and candidates must
be local or willing to relocate (we can not pay for relocation costs) for
the duration of the contract. 

** No telecommuters, unfortunately (on-site only).  

If you are interested, please send a resume AND code sample to me at
mbadolato@gmail.com. You may also contact me with any questions etc. 

The code sample doesn't have to be a full application; just enough to get a
feel for your style, experience, knowledge, etc. 

Note: for those of you that saw a similar posting from me two months ago,
this is not a re-post!	The three people brought onboard at that time are
still here, and we need even more resources, as more projects are in the
pipeline :)

Thanks,
--Mark Badolato
