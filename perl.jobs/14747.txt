Job title: Experienced Perl developer/educator.

Company name: Edument AB

Location: Malmö, Sweden

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
We know what people say about Perl. In all likelihood, you've heard it too.
We believe Perl has a kind of freedom and flexibility that's relatively
unmatched in other languages. We think that such freedom and flexibility
can lead to messy code, but in the right hands it can also lead to awesome
code. If that sounds like your hands, we're looking for you.

Edument is a high-quality consulting, mentoring and training company based
in the south of Sweden. We focus on solving the deep and challenging
problems that our clients face, often drawing on ideas and experiences from
agile, Test-driven development, Domain-driven design, CQRS, and languages
other than Perl. Many of us are active in development communities,
participating in open source projects and speaking at workshops, user
groups and conferences.

If you want to work on exciting problems with interesting people, Edument
would like to hear from you.

Required skills:
* Modern Perl
* Familiarity with CPAN

Desired skills:
* Moose
* Test-driven development
* Domain-driven design
