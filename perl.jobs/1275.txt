Job title: Experienced Junior Perl Programmer

Company name: ProCheckUp Ltd

Internal ID: pcnapp10

Location: United Kingdom, London, WC1

Pay rate: TBC

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 3 months, potentially longer

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have a series of irregularly-formatted legacy perl files, from which we
require data to be extracted. This is not a complicated matter, but rather
time consuming and fiddly: existing developers have a tight schedule and
are not available to undertake the work.

Due to the nature of our business – AI-guided network penetration- and
subversion-testing – this work must be executed in our offices on Russell
Square. 

There is a possibility that the right candidate may be offered a permanent
position in the Spring. 

Start-date: ASAP.


Required skills:
A full understanding of basic perl syntax, and the willingness to read
irregularly-formatted code.

Desired skills:
mod_perl and/or various network protocols and/or pen-testing experience

Contact information:
Please send questions and applications 
to Lee Goddard: perljobs@procheckup.com 020 7307 5001).

CVs should in RTF, HTML, PDF or plain text, please.
