Job title:
Senior Programmer for library book wholesaler

Company name: Follett Library Resources

Location: United States, IL, McHenry

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Follett Library Resources, the leading distributor of books and other media
to school libraries around the world, has an immediate IT opening for a
Senior Programmer. As our tremendous success continues, driven by our
innovative website, we are seeking a smart, curious, positive professional
to do great things in our web-programming department.

As a Senior Programmer, you'll help drive projects from design and
estimation through construction and completion.  You'll use your
programming chops not only to write code, but also to lead project teams
and help guide the technical direction of the department.  No wizards who
like to code in a closet need apply.

We use PHP and Perl for a 3-tier application running on Apache on Linux,
with Oracle on Solaris as the backend. We take life-long learning
seriously, and always look for new technologies to play with. Our rapid
growth guarantees you will not be bored.  We are agile, productive, and
quickly do our magic through short project cycles.  We’re a tightly knit
team, we don’t work sweatshop hours, we think programming is fun, and we
take great pride in our accomplishments.

Required skills:
Applicants should have 4+ years of application programming experience, with
at least one year of web applications.	You'll be fluent in Perl or PHP,
plus at least one other high-level object-oriented language.  You'll
understand basic database design and source code control.  Excellent
written and verbal communication is a must.

Desired skills:
Experience administering Oracle or another RDBMS is a plus.

Contact information:
Sorry, but telecommuting is not an option, and we do not sponsor visas.

We offer a competitive salary and an excellent benefits package including
medical and dental coverage, a generous 401k plan, profit sharing, flexible
spending plans, full undergraduate tuition reimbursement, earned time off
in the first year and more. We provide a pleasant, non-smoking office
environment in our state-of-the art headquarters and distribution center in
McHenry, Illinois, a far northwestern suburb of Chicago. We prefer
candidates to fax or e-mail resume with cover letter and salary
requirements to:
