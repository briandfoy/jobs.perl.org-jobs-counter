Job title: Bricolage Integration Consultant

Company name: IT assistance Ltd.

Location: Switzerland, BS, Basel

Pay rate: tbd

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 weeks from now

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Consulting for the realization of a multi language site, where it’s content
should be managed in Bricolage. 

The site should match to real URL's using Mason's (a/d)-handler logic. Main
issues are authentication and session creation in the beginning of a
request cycle, before the real content is delivered via Bricolage. Content
types must be defined and setup. 

You should be able to help us in a supporting manner to set up Bricolage,
fitting the final needs as described above. This might be also some coding,
but it’s mainly conceptual work, just telling us how to do it without
loosing time. 

Another issue is the needed feature that content contributors can edit main
content in a HTML editor. It would be great to use MM Contribute 2 via the
FTP protocol, editing contents as files via the Bricolage FTP daemon. 

Basically it's more conceptual & knowhow support than real coding. I do not
expect more than a total of one week work. 

Required skills:
You need to have productive experience with Bricolage. Of course you use
Mason (HTML::Mason) on mod_perl every day. And of course you know Perl OO
and all the nitty-gritty aspects. 

You need to speak, read and write fluently at least in German, English or
French. 

Used to dialog remotely mainly on text basis. 

Desired skills:
Please only respond if you have an online Bricolage reference used on a
daily basis. Thanks.
