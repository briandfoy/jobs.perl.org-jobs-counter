Job title: Perl Catalyst Developer

Company name: Connect Distribution

Location: Birmingham, UK

Pay rate: Competative

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
As a backfill for a promotion, we have an opportunity for a capable
developer to join our in-house team of open source developers.

We have
developed scores of eCommerce websites generating tens of millions of
pounds in income, and are currently in the process of re-developing the
data structure and publishing tools that these sites are based on, as well
as integrating them to a MS Dynamics AX ERP system and are re-building the
front ends to become responsive and device agnostic.

Whilst ideally we are
looking for someone with a Perl / Catalyst background, really what we want
is a good developer.  We have previously successfully cross-trained
developers with skills in languages such as PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript,
etc., and we’re prepared to invest in your training too, so the successful
candidate’s actual language experience is less important that the fact that
they can genuinely write good code.  

All the sites are hosted on Linux
with a MySQL back end, so exposure to this, or other Unix platforms, would
be useful, as would familiarity with version control systems such as
Subversion, Git, or Mercurial, etc

This role is based in Birmingham in the
UK and we are unable to assist in Visa applications.  Any non-UK applicants
must be prepared to relocate to the Birmingham area and be already
authorised to work in the UK.

The company is a family run business that
has been trading for over 45 years.  It currently employs c.600 staff and
has an annual turnover of c.£100m.

Desired skills:
The core technology these sites are based on is Perl, using the catalyst
framework, although we are increasing using AngularJS, and other
technologies used include MySQL, Couchbase, RabbitMQ, Redis, Solr,
ElasticSearch, and Puppet, to name a few.
