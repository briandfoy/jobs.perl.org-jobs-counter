Job title: Perl Developer - IMDb

Company name: Amazon.com

Internal ID: 24067

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: $100,000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Full Time Regular

Hours: Full time

Description:
If you're a top notch programmer and a fan of movies and TV, we've got the
ideal job for you.

There are many good reasons to work at IMDb, and here are three of them: 

* You can make a huge difference at IMDb. We've already developed a
successful business model and a stable production environment, so our
programmers spend their time developing and launching cool projects with
little red tape and lots of autonomy. 
* We offer flexibility both in terms of your day-to-day work schedule and
also in terms of work assignments. 
Our software developers provide lots of creative input into projects and
get to work on many different types of projects that allow them to think
creatively and to handle interesting computer science challenges.
* We have a great environment of talented people who work hard to make IMDb
the most credible media source on the planet. 

IMDb is owned by Amazon.com, but we operate separately and have our own
technology systems. When you join IMDb, you become a full-fledged
Amazon.com employee - which means you enjoy the cohesive work environment
of a small company while also gaining the bigger benefits of working for a
Fortune 500 company. It's the best of both worlds.


Required skills:
* All software positions require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in
computer science with three plus years of industry programming experience.
Our primary development language is Perl in the Linux/Unix environment, so
a solid base of skills in OO Perl and working knowledge of database
integration (MySQL or Postgres) are the core skills required for all
positions.

* This team is a client of the data team, and creates, maintains and
enhances our customer facing websites. In addition to the critical core
Perl/Db skills, a primary competency in client side development toolkit(s)
such as Javascript, DHTML, AJAX, Mason or Flash is required. 

* Our staff is distributed across the planet so we need employees who can
function independently while also interacting efficiently with other team
members.


Desired skills:
* We'd like to see a secondary optional advanced competency in one or more
areas such as web services, windows client development, expert systems,
natural language processing. We would be able to customize where we take
this role depending on the advanced competency you have to offer, so if you
meet the core requirements and have a skill that that you think we could
leverage, please let us know.
