Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: OpusVL

Location: Rugby, United Kingdom

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
At OpusVL we develop innovative software for clients ranging from SMEs to
big high street names.

We live and breathe Perl and open source. We contribute code to CPAN,
sponsor events and user groups, and several of our developers speak at Perl
Mongers technical meetings and conferences.

We’re now looking for a new Perl developer to join our team.

The typical work that we do is the development of bespoke “back-end”
systems for businesses. Our customers come from a number of industry
sectors so there’s always lots of variety and different projects to get
involved in. We are looking for developers with excellent technical and
problem solving abilities who share our passion for bringing open source
technologies to areas dominated by proprietary systems. 

You will have very strong Perl knowledge, especially around modern tools
and techniques. Devs who still write 1990s style Perl 4 code need not
apply. Experience of object oriented programming is required, as is an
understanding of the MVC design pattern.

Our deployment processes are built around the CPAN toolchain. We write all
of our customer code as modules, and upload to our local CPAN mirror for
installation. So it will be very beneficial if you have written CPAN
modules yourself, or otherwise understand how the CPAN build process works.


We offer a friendly and flexible working environment. We’re not a massive
company so there’s no corporate politics here, just a great team of people
who believe in open source and enjoy what they do.

Required skills:
Fluency in Perl (obviously)
Object oriented programming
Database programming / SQL
Understand the MVC model

Desired skills:
Moose
Catalyst (or other MVC framework)
DBIx::Class (or other ORM)
Template::Toolkit
Test::More (or other Perl testing modules)
JavaScript / jQuery / AJAX
REST 
CouchDB (or other NoSQL database)

We do not require that you have any formal qualifications or further
education.
