Job title: Software Dev Eng, Sr

Company name: Yahoo

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale (or WFH)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you aren't in the SF bay area, telecommuting or working in another
Yahoo! office in the USA would probably work.

Think about impacting 1 out of every 2 people online--in innovative and
imaginative ways that are uniquely Yahoo!. We do just that each and every
day, and you could too. After all, it's big thinkers like you who will
create the next generation of Internet experiences for consumers and
advertisers across the globe. Now's the time to show the world what you've
got. Put your ideas to work for over half a billion people.

The Unix Systems Infrastructure team at Yahoo! is looking for mid level to
senior level Perl developer. Bachelor's degree in computer science or
related field, or equivalent combination of education and experience.
Understanding of abstract data types, algorithms and analysis.
Understanding of object-oriented design and programming. Ability to write
high quality, well-documented, self-documenting, maintainable, unit tested,
per formant code.

Have a sample? Even better Perl, or other language, with a willingness to
learn Perl. Understanding of common testing practices and methodologies. A
willingness to learn and try new stuff, every day. Things change fast
around here, and if you don't like change, you won't like this job any more
than it likes you. Relentless customer focus. Good verbal and written
communication skills.

Yahoo! Inc. is an equal opportunity employer. For more information or to
