Company name: Golden Guru

Location: Seattle, WA, United States

Pay rate: TBD (US$)

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're looking for a qualified senior Perl developer and architect to join
our team to build and maintain complex web applications and back-end
services across a series of different environments and for a variety of
clients. The person will be part of a very senior team of software
engineers. (See http://goldenguru.com/team for details.) The person will
also be called on to research and design new software and systems
architectures.

Required skills:
We need someone with very strong with Perl and OOP, someone with strong
software architecture wisdom, and someone who can fit into a team of
equally senior engineers. We're looking for someone sufficiently senior
enough to work on projects solo as needed without the need for oversight
and yet who will follow our strict style guide and best practices in all
cases. Viable candidates will have a track-record of self-motivation, high
attention to detail, and ability to work very independently.

Desired skills:
Desired skills for the position include experience with some mixture of
some of the following: Debian system administration and networking,
Mojolicious, nginx, Couch, Solr, Postgres, Git, jQuery, XHTML/CSS, and
Template Toolkit. PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile experience is a bonus.
