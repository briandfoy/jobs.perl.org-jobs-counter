Hi all,

I've recently been laid off from my dot-com and am looking for a new 
full-time job. I have several years of perl, as well as mod_perl, 
programming experience. I also have experience with mod_perl handlers, 
Apache, SQL/MySQL, and XML. My resume and more details are available at 
http://www.drewtaylor.com/

Details:
I live in Lexington, MA and am willing to work anywhere in the greater 
Boston area. Telecommuting would be fine, as well as on-site jobs.

Thanks.

Drew Taylor
