Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Description:
Is your software being used by people around the world?
Is your software able to communicate with a vehicle thousands of miles
away?

Ours does. We are O'Neil & Associates, an ESOP company located near low
cost of living Dayton, Ohio.

We believe in using open standards and technologies; it's how we build apps
and solutions.

We think internet technologies make a great platform.

We have small and large projects (and customers).

We have team-oriented and solo projects.

For the curious, here are some of the tools we use: Perl, CGI, XML,
[X]HTML, XSLT, CSS, AJAX, Browser DOM, 
Javascript, SQL, cygwin, Apache, Tomcat, SQLServer, Oracle, CVS, subversion


At O'Neil, our core business is the development of electronic publishing
systems, Content Management Systems (CMS), Learning Management Systems
(LMS), Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs), data conversion,
illustrations, markup languages, intrusive diagnostics,
adaptive troubleshooting. 

We continue to grow and are looking to add to our talented staff. If you
are a talented developer, understand OO, can readily pick up new
technologies, and are ready for something new and exciting, visit us at
http://www.oneil.com/cfm/openings.cfm

Mostly we want talent, not buzzword matching.

Required skills:
OO Perl 
Programming talent - good solution design
Continuous learning drive

Desired skills:
The more internet and open standards & technology familiarity, the more we
want you.

Nevertheless, if you are good, you are good, regardless of background.
