powerful and easy to use story and media editing environment for magazine

the data entered in the story editor, and add code to drive the templates
to build output.The right candidate must thrive working in a team-based,

a project from end to end, delegate/coordinate tasks to on-site and
outsourced resources as necessary. A successful candidate will be a

development prowess

•	Proven ability to work with business analysts, network engineers
and graphic designers to build and maintain cutting-edge sites, integrating
video content, e-commerce and social networking elements.
•	Expert-level understanding of Web standards and limitations,
browser and platform compatibility, and best practices for coding and
workflow. 
•	Ability to lead a project from inception through deployment, as
well as ability to multitask and work on numerous complex assignments that
come together under one deadline.
•	Ability to develop code in a clean and consistent manner while
working within a site hierarchy that is reusable and expandable. 
•	Excellent oral and written communication skills.
