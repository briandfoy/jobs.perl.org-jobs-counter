Job title:
Deployment Automation Developer for financial Institution

Company name: JPMorgan Chase

Internal ID: 090013391

Location: India, Mumbai

Description:
Automation of application deployment and operations is a growing industry
trend, as technology groups in corporations around the world turn their
automation skills to their own processes and data centres. It is a key
process for the stability and efficiency of environments in an
ever-changing business world.
 
The architecture function for a major business group within the Investment
Bank had a dedicated team who develop and implement a framework for
automation of deployments and environments across multiple applications. As
a key member of that team, you will be part of a transformative change, and
in the process gaining wide experience of some of the firm's critical
applications.
 
The role combines application development of the tools with implementing
them for real - partnering with application teams to help them migrate
their applications and environments.  The automation tools are based on the
proven framework used by another group within the firm, and an "internal
open source" project shares the framework across both groups. Like an
Apache or Eclipse project this has a PMC to co-ordinate changes and a set
of committers who make changes - you will be one of those committers.
 
You'll already have good Perl, C++ and Unix/Linux skills. Subversion,
ClearCase, Sybase, SQL,  Apache, web/CGI, Tomcat, iterative development,
continuous integration, unit testing and networking skills are also great
to have, as is a working knowledge of the ITIL framework and terms. For the
skills you don't yet have, you'll be in an excellent environment to learn
them, with formal training courses and working alongside specialists in the
field. Your technical skills will be matched by good people skills, working
with a range of people in build, operate, test, environment management and
architect roles.
 
If you want to develop great tools and make them work in real environments,
working in a collaborative open source style, with the ability to make a
visible impact in a global corporation, this is the role you've been
waiting for.

Required skills:
Perl and Unix/Linux skills.
Subversion, ClearCase, Sybase, SQL,  Apache, web/CGI, Tomcat, iterative
development, continuous integration

Desired skills: C++ (major plus)
