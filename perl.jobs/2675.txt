Job title: unix sysadmin/perl programmer

Company name: IC Group

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IC Group needs a Unix sysadmin to manage our network of Linux machines. 
Our services are based around email for both individuals and corporate
customers.  We use Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl, and Postfix.

You would be a good fit if you
* have 3-5 years' experience administrating Unix machines in a commercial
setting
* live near Philadelphia or are willing to move here
* work efficiently without much supervision (are self-directed)
* are lazy enough to automate common tasks so that you don't have to keep
doing them over and over

Some local travel is required as necessary to deal with remotely hosted
travel; we will provide a car, but you will need a driver's license.

Required skills:
* Linux (especially Debian)
* Unix fundamentals; e.g. inodes, superblocks, swap, pipes, devices,
permissions
* Unix security basics
* configuration for Apache, mail servers, databases, and other third-party
software
* common networking protocols, e.g. smtp, http, dns, ssh
* Bourne shell
* well-organized Perl as glue between programs/machines/data sources
