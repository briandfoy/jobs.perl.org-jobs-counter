Job title: Perl / Web Engineer

Location: United States, CA, Palo Alto

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our client is the leading news community on the Web, connecting people to
the information and discussions that matter to them in every U.S. town and
city. The company links news from 50,000 sources to 360,000 lively
user-generated forums. They also works with the nation’s major media
companies to grow and engage their online audiences through forums,
classifieds, publishing platforms and RSS feeds. This is a privately held
company with investment from Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI), The McClatchy
Company (NYSE: MNI) and Tribune Company (NYSE: TRB).

Are you one of us?
You live and breathe software and the Internet. CPAN and Slashdot are only
a click away in your bookmarks toolbar, and improving code performance,
reliability and maintainability intrigues you.

Work and Fun aren't mutually exclusive. You push yourself to deliver your
best, but you're also easygoing enough to roll with the punches. Releasing
new software to the world pumps you up, and you don't think twice about
double checking and testing before a push. But you're also up for hanging
out with the crew and eating pizza on the couch.

What are we looking for?
Web/Perl Software Engineer
4+ years of commercial programming experience that is recently web focused;
strong programming skills in Perl, and knowledgeable with Linux and Apache;
great design skills and a practice of thoroughly testing code before
release.

We're working on solving interesting and challenging problems related to:

*  crawling
*  geo-localization and subject categorization of the news
*  Named entity disambiguation
*  About-vs-mention discrimination
*  Heat and tone language detection
*  Zero-configuration scalable crawling
*  All in-memory index serving
*  On-the-fly category merging, clustering, de-duplication, and
geo-spinning
*  Anti spam
*  Auto-kickstart servers
*  Reporting and tracking

We need YOU to help our users by improving our forums, news, classified and
other pages. Though we don't expect you to have expertise in solving these
kinds of problems, we encourage you to come talk to us if they sound
interesting. 

Required skills:
Perl 
Apache
Linux
4+ years of experience developing robust web based applications
