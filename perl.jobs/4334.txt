Job title:
Linux / Apache / MySQL / Perl (LAMP) Developer

Company name: WireSpring Technologies, Inc

Internal ID: WS2006-Q203

Location: United States, FL, Ft. Lauderdale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Do you love Linux / Apache / MySQL / Perl (LAMP) and have serious DHTML,
HTML and JavaScript skills? Were you writing asynchronous JavaScript and
XML applications before AJAX was even an acronym? If so, WireSpring has an
immediate opening for a LAMP Developer, and you might be the right person
for the job!

Our candidate should have experience using Perl to do everything from
hacking together system administration scripts to developing beautiful,
complex, high-level applications, to writing interactive AJAX web sites --
and must be comfortable doing it all in a Linux environment (we don't do
Windows).

Working with our close-knit and highly seasoned technical staff, our
candidate will get the opportunity to work on a number of exciting projects
for our remotely managed Linux-based operating system and web-based central
administration platform. Our candidate's job will be about 60% application
design & development, 20% system administration (or building tools for
system administration) and 20% troubleshooting. The skills that we're
looking for are:

Required skills:
# Strong knowledge of Perl (though we'll consider great PHP, Python or Java
programmers who are willing to learn). Work with object-oriented Perl is a
big plus, but not required. Ditto for mod_perl.

# Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (our web application
interfaces use a lot of DHTML, so this is a must!)

# Strong knowledge of SQL (we're using MySQL right now, but your knowledge
should be portable to other relational database systems)

# Experience using Perl to interact with XML (SOAP or XMLRPC), especially
for writing Perl back-ends for AJAX processes.

# Linux/BSD/UNIX server administration skills like configuring/optimizing
Apache and MySQL, writing cron jobs, troubleshooting system problems, etc.

# Experience designing and writing web-based applications, since that's
obviously what we're talking about here.

# Experience using CVS or some other version control system.

# Ability to learn new things -- quickly.

# Sense of humor. (Yes, it's required.)

Desired skills:
# Graphic arts abilities - Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, etc. to make our
web apps pretty

# Experience writing Apache modules in C or Perl

# Experience writing and documenting software APIs.

# Experience with lower-level system programming in C or C++

# Experience working on large projects (many developers/lots of code)

# Experience working on open-source projects (large or small)

# Experience writing user-facing applications (browser-based or traditional
client apps), especially for self-service devices like interactive kiosks.
