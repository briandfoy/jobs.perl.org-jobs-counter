Job title:
Distraction-free Workplace - Escape Standups and Scrum - Perl Developer
West London

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Strong

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Personally, I love Agile and Scrum so much I wrote a set of blog articles
detailing why I love them so much. But it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. Some
 people yearn for being given a two-week task, going away, and getting it
done well by themselves, or in consultation with highly technical and
well-read colleagues.

Client is a small development team where everyone is
expected to pull their own weight. No daily standups, no planning poker,
just you and your work, aided by some of the most experienced technical
colleagues in London. You’ll be encouraged to make sensible use of Modern
Perl tooling and grow your personal experience of best development
practices under excellent technical leadership.

Work environment is very
professional, very corporate, but technical excellence and doing things the
right way are looked upon very favourably. This would be the great role for
a journeyman (or journeywoman, but I don’t think that’s a real word) Perl
Developer who’s made a big individual contribution in their current role,
but wants to get started on their masterpiece.

One of a small number of
companies where I advise clients to interview all candidates with a spell
at this company on their CV, because I know they’ll be well-versed in best
practices, and getting stuff done.

Based in leafy South West London, on
the London Overground, and open to anyone with an existing right to work in
the UK/EU.
