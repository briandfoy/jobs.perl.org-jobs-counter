Job title: Perl developer

Company name: BookTrolls, LLC

Location: Houston, TX, USA

Pay rate: USD $110000/yr

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
BookTrolls is looking to hire top-notch developers to help fuel our rapid
expansion. This will not just be a software integration/automation
position. We write enterprise-class TCP/IP servers and large, performant
back-end applications. We write software for a wide range of business
applications for internal users; and both our culture and our development
model are pretty informal. Hours are flexible. Our software team is small,
fast, flexible, and growing; and we offer a greater degree of creative
control and project ownership than you'll find at "big" software companies.
Plus, you can ride the forklift. This position is ideal for an ambitious,
energetic self-starter with a mastery of Perl.

We offer a 401(k) with 100%
match of up to 4% of salary, with immediate vesting, plus medical and
dental. Visa sponsorship available. Partial telecommute is available after
your first 6 months and increases with seniority and performance. We offer
relocation assistance to Houston. Starting salary is $110K for the
mid-level position.

Responsibilities

- Work with warehouse managers to
gather requirements, design, implement, and enhance the software that runs
every department
- Heavy client/server programming, from simple web scripts
to massively multi-threaded custom TCP/IP servers
- Data warehousing,
revenue analysis, and reporting
- Develop secure web services to interface
with our partner businesses
- Use (and optionally contribute to) CPAN

About Our Company

We are one of the largest independent booksellers on the
Amazon and eBay marketplaces, among other online marketplaces.
Headquartered in Houston, we sell purely online and ship from four
warehouses around the world. We started in a garage in 2006 and have since
expanded to 150 employees globally. Our main competitive advantage is our
in-house software, which runs every aspect of our business and possesses
capabilities unseen in our industry. Most of our competitors run their
companies off shrink-wrapped 3rd-party vendor software -- and it shows. We
are not a software company, but software is at the core of what we do.

Please note that our main website (booktrolls.com) does not reflect the
primary business model that this position will support.

Desired skills:
- Thoroughly fluent in Perl; preferably writing more than just "glue"
scripts
- Fluent in object-oriented design
- Fluent in regular expressions
- Basic Linux command line skills (file manipulation, editors, grep, etc)
-
Multi-threading experience, including deadlocks, race conditions, etc
-
Familiarity with BerkeleyDB, HTML, JavaScript, client/server programming,
and system-level Linux skills
- Excellent code documentation skills
- There
is no minimum requirement of work experience or education. We care about
(and will heavily test) your skill, not your pedigree
