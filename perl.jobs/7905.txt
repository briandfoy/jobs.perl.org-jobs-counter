Job title: Perl MySql - Data Integration

Company name: HRN

Internal ID: MngrPerl.01

Location: United States, TX, Houston

Pay rate: $16-$19/hr USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
***MANAGER POSITION***

We are looking for a manager of multiple Perl/MySQL freelancers.  The
manager must be able to work like and manage those who...

MUST HAVE:
a) Strong MySql skills
b) Good working knowledge of PERL
c) Understand GIS/geocoding

Our company integrates data from multiple sources into a database and has
pre-defined table structures for the end-product.

The data integration must be done on a market-by-market basis. We have
implemented the solution on four markets.

We are looking to add a fifth market. All of the data sets have been
gathered.

The right candidate will work with the company DBA to understand data
structure, and with the company Business Analyst to understand how to
translate the data sources into the proper fields.

Further specifics:

a) Calculating centroid points from GIS shapefiles
b) Placing centroid points on to other data layers to gather information,
such as "zip code", or "school district"
c) Creating a process for automatically uploading the same (but updated)
dataset
d) Creating data exports

Based on our experience, estimated Hours are expected to be 50 in total, as
this is not a small job. There are 4 Main Data Sources plus several
ancillary ones (such as GIS layers).

A key skill is the ability to communicate and ask questions so that we can
quickly move through stopping points. We use Skype to chat, which is a must
for questions, although we do not like to interrupt programmers.

If you are uncomfortable on Skype/IM, then this is the wrong position for
you.

Please include:

a) Skype or other IM address
b) resume
c) Availability

We pay twice a month

Required skills:
Perl
MySql
Understand GIS
Deadline Management

Desired skills: English
