Job title:
Advanced OO perl engineer (f/m) for large scale web application

Company name: mobile.de AG

Location: Germany, Hamburg

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
mobile.de offers brokerage of vehicles through the Internet for
private customers and car dealers. 

Our software is based on a custom OO application framework in perl,
running on an Open Source Foundation of Linux/Apache/mod_perl and MySQL.
We serve around 650 million pages a month using more than 600 machines.

The job position involves refining the design and implementation
of our framework as well as planning and implementation of 
our applications. Accepting technical responsibility on a 
per-project basis is expected.

Sharing and communicating your knowledge is a big part of the job,
we seek to continuously improve our knowledge as a team.

We have done a complete rewrite of a 5 year old codebase in a living
system. We learned to design in a team-oriented way leaving room
for experiments.  You can talk to us at YAPC::Europe Belfast.

Overtime is an exception - put in if absolutely necessary but
actively avoided.

We offer payment on a competitive basis and a relaxed, friendly work
atmosphere (you may have to practice some tabletop football) in return for
your skills and commitment.

Required skills:
A few years of experience in designing and building 
large, object oriented perl applications.
Having stuff on CPAN is a big plus.

Awareness of mod_perl (or other persistent environment)
related issues (i.e. unshared memory usage).

Focus on code maintainability and documentation

Familiarity with less known corners of perl resulting 
in an extraordinary ability to find twisted bugs or think 
up elegant solutions the perl way.

A fair amount of affection for the language and exposure
of the "notoriously helpful" social interface often found
in the perl community. Strong team skills.

Ability to design software that will survive changing 
business needs while keeping a pragmatic approach.

You feel at home with Unix and perl, eyes and mind are open.

SQL, Database design

Fluency in German is a must

Desired skills:
understanding of system level issues (shared memory, httpd-tuning)

experience with mod_perl in large software systems

MySQL peculiarities (index usage, query optimization)

XML data design experience, XSchema

extended CVS experience
