Job title: Software Engineer In Test

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA

Pay rate: $100,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for a talented, experienced, and
highly motivated Software Engineer in Test to help us develop and improve
our products, websites, and customer portal. Founded in 2002, MaxMind is an
industry-leading provider of IP intelligence and online fraud detection
tools. MaxMind is privately held and based in Waltham, Massachusetts.

Transaction fraud detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is
never done. Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection,
which means we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud
detection service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP
products, which associate geographical and other data with individual IP
addresses. We screen half a billion online transactions each year and
provide IP intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

THE
POSITION:

Your job will be to work with our QA team, developers, and
product management to test changes to existing products, as well as test
new products to ensure they behave as expected. You will also liaise with
our support team so that you are aware of problems being reported by users.
You will work with developers to triage and reproduce these bugs and make
sure they are fixed in future releases.

Things that need testing at
MaxMind include our website, our web services, our downloadable databases,
client APIs, and more. Your job is to break them all and then help us
rebuild them.

We're looking for a detail-oriented person with strong
development and communication skills. Whenever possible, we expect you to
automate tests using tools like Selenium,TeamCity, virtual machines, etc.
When manual testing is needed, you will need to document your test plans
for future use. We have great unit tests, and recently developed the
infrastructure for integration tests, but we would greatly benefit from
improved functional testing.

Our development team is largely comprised of
telecommuters, so communication centers around Google Hangouts, group chat,
and agile planning tools. We invite candidates to apply from the US states
of Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon and
anywhere in Canada. Relocation to any of the above mentioned locations is
welcome. Full-time telecommuting is permitted.

The salary range for this
position starts at $100k/year and is negotiable depending on experience.
Employees additionally participate in a performance-based bonus plan.


WORKING AT MAXMIND:
MaxMind is a casual, friendly, results-focused company
of 30-some employees, about half of whom are in technical positions. We
maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but weâ€™re flexible with specific
start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life
events.

Software engineers get a $2k professional development budget and
five days of time to use for professional development annually.

In
addition to medical, dental, and vision coverage, we offer several other
benefits (in the US) including a 401k with employer contribution, FSA, and
transit reimbursement. Please inquire about benefits in Canada.

Our office
is located near downtown Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, a five minute walk
from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus lines.


OUR
DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES: 
Our backend code is largely written in Perl and Go
using PostgreSQL and Linux. We maintain high standards for our development
practices. All new code is expected to include automated tests run by
TeamCity, and all work goes through internal code review on GitHub
Enterprise.

We use free software as much as possible, and we release code
back to the community when we can do so. We're trying to improve the way we
do development, and we expect you to participate in that process.

Note: We
can only consider applications from the US states of Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon, and anywhere in Canada.
