Job title: Senior System Administrator

Company name: Kapor Enterprises

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: US $

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Looking for a job where you can use your IT skills to make the world a
better place? Kapor Enterprises, Inc. (www.kei.com) provides IT services to
a number of high-profile non-profit groups in the San Francisco area that
focus on technology and social good, including
Creative Commons, the Open Source Applications Foundation, and the Level
Playing Field Institute (www.creativecommons.org, www.osafoundation.org,
www.lpfi.org).

KEI provides excellent employee benefits, a set of diverse and challenging
projects and a genuinely pleasant place to work -- we strive to keep our
work environment free of pointy-haired bosses,absurd deadlines and
death-marches. Our SOMA offices are sunny, casual and dog-friendly, and are
easy to get to from BART, Caltrain and MUNI. We also provide reimbursement
for public transportation,
parking, home Internet connections and wellness programs.


Required skills:
We're currently looking for a senior-level sysadmin with several years of
Linux/UNIX experience, who also has substantial experience with Windows
desktop support, scripting (either Perl or Python plus shell scripting),
Apache configuration and helpdesk.

This position will be a mix of conventional sysadmin work
(configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of our 40+ servers), helpdesk
response, project management for some new projects we have coming and some
small application development. We're looking for the rare person who can
transition between these different types of tasks
with ease, with bonus points for someone with postfix, MySQL, and Mac OS X
experience.
