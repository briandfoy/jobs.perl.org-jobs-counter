Job title: Network Appliance Engineer

Company name: Lok Technology

Location: 95110, CA, San Jose

Pay rate: up to $150K / yr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are a different kind of company, mainly because we're all a little
crazy.	We are led by Dr. Simon Lok who describes himself as a megalomaniac
entrepreneur.  He is also by far the most technically astute CTO you will
ever meet. Our engineering team is a small tight knit family that shares
many common interests like owning fast cars, driving like maniacs,
snowboarding (via helicopter), finding awesome restaurants to dine at,
taking hip hop dance classes at Club One and of course working insane
hours.	

We are looking for people that are first and foremost compatible with our
culture.  We've hired people with PhD's for $150K salaries and they lasted
29 days.  We've also hired people as interns for $10 an hour, and one of
them is our Director of Engineering.  What this has taught us is that we
need to find the right kind of personality rather than the right kind of
pedigree.

Are you a little crazy?  Are you into networking or have a burning desire
to get into it?  Want to work on appliances (i.e., hardware) instead of web
sites and other typical Perl stuff?  This may be your place.  Read up about
us at http://www.lok.com.  Contact us if you are interested.

Required skills:
UNIX system administration, configuration and deployment 
OO Perl and advanced scripting techniques 
TCP/IP network deployment and configuration 

Desired skills:
CGI web applications 
XHTML, XSLT/XML/XSL, CSS web development 
Javascript, DHTML, AJAX 
Static and dynamic routing methodology 
DHCP, DNS, SMTP, IMAP, HTTP/Apache server configuration 
Firewall, NAT, router configuration 
Database design and administration 
mod_perl 
MySQL, Berkeley DB 
OpenBSD or FreeBSD familiarity 
Wireless networking technologies, implementation 
RADIUS, LDAP server configuration, deployment and implementation 
File server technologies, NetBIOS, NFS, Samba 
Sendmail 
Bandwidth management, traffic shaping and QoS technologies 
Intrusion protection system technologies, Snort 
Link control technologies 
VoIP PBX systems, specifically Asterisk
