Subject: Seeking Perl work in the Portland, Oregon metro area
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: igal+work@koshevoy.com (Igal Koshevoy)

Seeking position as project leader, architect, or senior software
engineer. Looking for something local, but will consider telecommuting.

I have 7 years of extensive Perl experience. The last two years I was
CTO and architect developing a distributed, object-oriented system.
The beast used 150,000 lines of Perl & SQL, and exchanged 6 GB of data
a day between servers across the nation. It used mod_perl, Mason,
h2xs, PlRPC, XML; Solaris, Linux; Oracle, PL/SQL, and PostgreSQL.

My broad skill set lets me rapidly build systems:
- Leadership & project management: Able to budget, plan, and manage
  the software process.
- Software engineer: Can do architecture, object design, and complex
  coding.
- DBA and data modeling: Skilled in schema design, data replication,
  backup/recovery, and tuning.
- System and network admin: Managed hundreds of UNIX and Windows
  machines, LANs, WANs, etc.
