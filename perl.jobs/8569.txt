Job title:
Perl programmer: Challenging projects, brilliant coworkers

Company name: Rentrak Corporation

Location: United States, OR, Portland

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Rentrak Corporation is always looking for talented developers to add to our
team in beautiful Portland, Oregon.

You're probably used to being the smartest developer on your team (but are
too humble to admit it), and are looking for a place where you can work
alongside talented peers building great software for interesting projects.
At Rentrak, we're a small enough company that you can make a big
difference, but we're big enough to ensure your paycheck never bounces.

Our teams are relatively small (three to six people), and we have a
development environment influenced by XP. We have a nice open work area so
our developers can share their brilliant ideas, learn from each other,
expand our extensive custom libraries and work together to solve tough
problems. We keep our source code base well factored and filled with unit
tests.

We work with a stunningly large amount of data, and everyone here does an
amazing job of turning it into something manageable. We have a very high
hiring bar, and we feel that all the people who work here could easily get
a job at any of the major tech companies. Our management understands this
and works hard to make sure our developers are happy and productive.


Required skills:
We work mostly in Perl, but we don't particularly require Perl experience.

Desired skills:
Experience with functional or dynamic object-oriented development
experience is great (e.g., Lisp, Smalltalk, Scheme, Ocaml, SML, Haskell,
Ruby, Unlambda, C++/STL/Boost, or advanced use of Python or Perl). RDBMS
experience is also helpful, especially with terabyte-plus databases.

Rentrak's developers work with their teammates on all aspects of the
development process: requirements gathering, system design, database design
and tuning and, of course, lots of unit tests and coding.
