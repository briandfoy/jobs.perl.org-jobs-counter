Hi,

I am a perl solutions engineer.  I've used perl both professionally
and personally.  I am expert in CGI solutions, including
database-driven content delivery applications, as well as utility
and tool programming.  I started using perl about six or seven
years ago.  Using perl, I've launched sites like GreaterGood.com,
HFRadio.org, and assisted a variety of others.  I've also used Perl
for data mining and internal (to corporation) use.

I am currently looking for part-time, full-time contract or
contract-to-hire work.  I will telecommute or travel, depending on
situation.  I might be interested in full-time employment in
Washington state, perhaps other locations.

I have 17+ years of experience creating software solutions,
including e-commerce and database-driven websites.  Perl and C/C++
are my strong areas, with Un*x (Linux, Sun, AIX, BSD) my choice of
OS.  I am well-versed in SQL (PostgreSQL, etc.) and database
engineering as well as HTML/XML/DHTML.

If you are interested in viewing my resume, please visit

My personal page is http://hfradio.org - completely running on perl
scripts (provides live data, databased data, and search), and
PostgreSQL.

Thanks,

Tomas
