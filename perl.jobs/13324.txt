Job title: Technical Fellow US Based

Company name: gteam

Internal ID: TFUS

Location: HOME BASED

Pay rate: 60/hr

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Performance based

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We pay $60/hour ($1500 fixed-price payment for a trial job if that trial
leads us to hire you).	We work with you through one of several approved
staffing and payment platforms which will charge a percentage fee on your
gross earnings, but you understand how those are.  For United States
citizens and permanent residents, we pay $48/hour because we have to cover
W-2 processing.
 
You would need:
Experience – more than 5 years in direct hands-on coding, which we assume
led to a prior technical team leadership role, because you’re that good at
it.
Software Engineering – you should know the current software development
practices and tools, including
Virtual environments
Source control
Remote development
Issue tracking
Build and test automation
Networking Management
General coding and scripting – you know Java, C, .Net, or maybe all three,
and you understand programming well enough to quickly learn new languages
and scripting.
Differentiated capability – meaning, what everyone else can’t do, you can.
 
If this sounds exciting, but you don’t have that much experience, or
differentiated capability just doesn’t describe you yet, how about trying
our Software Engineer position for a while, and see what happens?
 
Non-technical skills you’d need
Speak English.	Write English.	Not just barely, but capably.
Video Skype capability, webcam, and you know how to use them to talk with
us and do daily work.
40 hours per week available for this job.

Desired skills:
General coding and scripting – you know Java, C, .Net, or maybe all three,
and you understand programming well enough to quickly learn new languages
and scripting.
Differentiated capability – meaning, what everyone else can’t do, you can.
