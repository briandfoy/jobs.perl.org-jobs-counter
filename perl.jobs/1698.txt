Description:
We produce a wide variety of B2B and B2C web-based products. As a result of
our expanding development core, we are looking for a senior Perl developer
to join us as head of development. This position will involve hands-on
coding to create new products, optimize existing ones and finish off those
that are incomplete. In addition, you will be responsible for leading,
organizing and assisting other developers with their projects.

Candidates must be extremely self-motivated and thrive in the start-up
environment. A passion and dedication for what you do is imperative. Our
programming core is predominantly telecommute, so you must possess
excellent communications skills. You must be able to communicate well with
both the technologically literate (your programming team) and the
"illiterate", as you will be the liaison between the development and
administrative sides of the company.

We are looking for someone who can not only create programs based on specs,
but think creatively to help the company continue to grow.

Payment terms will be discussed with qualifying applicants. We firmly
believe in tying company success to your success, so you will also be put
on a profit sharing plan to supplement your pay check.

We operate in a dynamic, laid-back yet action-packed environment, where we
demand the best from our staff, and create products that always surpass our
expectations. If you are ready to take on such a challenge and operate in
this senior role of a thriving new company, then please forward résumés and
cover letters to the address provided below.

Required skills:
> Excellent PERL (incl. mod-perl) skills.
---- The words "It can't be done" cannot be in your vocabulary! ----
> Excellent communications skills
> Comfortable working in, operating, and managing a Linux environment 
> Strong knowledge of MySQL (both use and administration) 
> HTML /  CSS
----An eye for design is not necessary, as we have talented designers---
> JavaScript
> Ability to balance short-term tasks with long-term product vision 
> Ability to learn and adapt quickly 
> Self-motivated and able to motivate others 
> Creative thinking is a must!
> A strong team-player

MUST BE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA.

Desired skills:
Interpersonal skills:
> Self-motivated. 
> Exceptional creativity and productive energy. 
> Excellent planning and documentation skills.
> Excellent time management skills to meet demanding timelines. 
> Ability to work well in teams and independently. 
> Strong sense of ownership and urgency to deliver projects in a timely
fashion. 

Managerial Experience:
> Any previous experience leading/managing a team of developers is helpful.

> Any previous experience acting as a liaison between the development
department and other functional units within the company also helps.

Above all else, we're looking for the desire to take on this job, not
simply as an assignment, but as a project that is your own, and from which
you can expect an exciting future!
