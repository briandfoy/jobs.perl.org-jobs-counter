Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Adestra Limited

Internal ID: Dev2

Location:
United Kingdom, Oxford/London/Telecommute

Pay rate: Upto £40k + bonus

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for an experienced Senior Perl Developer to join our small
Oxford-based team and assist in the design and implementation of the second
version of our MessageFocus email marketing platform.

Adestra was formed in 2004 as an email marketing service provider, with a
focus on responsible marketing. Since then we have been successful in
developing and deploying our web based email marketing platform,
MessageFocus.

We're currently working on MessageFocus v2, a Catalyst, Moose and
DBIx::Class based replacement for MessageFocus, which is approaching Alpha
release status. We are looking for an experienced, full-time Senior Perl
Developer to help us bring this project to completion and assist in its
continued development.


Required skills:
Day to day duties are centred on designing and implementing features for
the MessageFocus web interface. Although, as part of a small team, you will
have the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the system from
user interface design to scaling high-throughput, high-availability
systems.

A strong understanding and commercial experience with modern Perl
programming and development practices is essential, along with experience
developing web interfaces and working with databases.


Desired skills:
Experience with any of the following would be advantageous:

 * PostgreSQL
 * Catalyst or other MVC web frameworks
 * DBIx::Class or ORM systems in general
 * Moose
 * JavaScript
 * "NoSQL" databases
 * Designing high-availablity systems
 * Scaling web-based applications

Previous experience with Catalyst/DBIC/Moose development would be
considered a significant advantage.
