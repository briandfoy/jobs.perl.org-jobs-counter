Job title:
Dev/Ops - Reliability Engineering  - Sr. Software Engineer

Company name: Kareo

Location: Irvine, CA

Pay rate: $80K-$140K

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are Kareo, a small but fast growing software company based in sunny
Irvine, California. We power thousands of small medical practices in the
U.S and we’re leading our industry in the shift from traditional software
to cloud computing (a.k.a. Software-as-a-Service) and taking today’s
complex healthcare system and making it easy. In short, this allows doctors
to spend less time worrying about their business and more time caring for
patients and saving lives. Technology is revolutionizing this industry and
Kareo is positioned to carry the torch for the 500,000 small medical office
physicians who represent the backbone of the American healthcare system.

We're looking for a kick a$$ engineer whose calling is to develop tools to
make life of the fellow coder easier, more reliable, and more fun. You'll
be joining a ragtag team of LEET engineers - aka the Platform team - to
help keep our features fast, architecture moving, and infrastructure
stable. We work hard to deliver early and often. Not only that, you’ll be
helping to drive the engineering culture of awesome through best practices
in testing, automation, and tooling.

What you'll do:

• Keep our development team honest with a reliable continuous deployment
process. And when they're not, riddle them with Nerf darts.
• Be the master of our development, QA, and production environments whether
it's in the cloud or in our data center.
• Help drive decisions on our architecture as we bring on more doctors to
the platform and engineers to our family.
• Read over our Puppet manifest files and tell us what we did right (or
likely what we did wrong).

Required skills:
You'll need:

• To believe that your purpose in life is to optimize the
build-measure-learn loop with kick ass software. DevOps is not just a
movement; it’s a state of mind.
• "Fu Manchu style" technology wisdom, a willingness to teach, and a dash
of irreverence.
• Experience working in high traffic, load balanced server environments.
• The uncanny ability to recognize code scalability, testability,
availability, and performance characteristics when blind folded.
• The belief in the right-tool-for-the-job, not language-as-a-religion.
Why? Because innovation isn't tied to a language.

Desired skills:
Tools we geek over:

• Team City, Jenkins, Artifactory, and Maven
• Puppet or Chef
• AppDynamics, New Relic, and Sumologic
• Redis, MongoDB, memcached
• Spring, ActiveMQ, and ServiceStack
• Mercurial or git
• C#, Java, Ruby, and JVM language projects like Scala
