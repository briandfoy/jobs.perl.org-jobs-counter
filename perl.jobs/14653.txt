Description:
The Senior Data Engineer will be responsible for harnessing data to make

You’ll work with massive, unfiltered data sets - like the contents of every

You will be responsible for architecting the data platforms and pipelines
to improve our product and empower our team, partners and users with
insights. Applications could include improving the relevance and quality of
Adzuna’s search results and building algorithms recommending relevant jobs
using content-based or collaborative filters.

You will be the first data engineer at Adzuna, which is a 'Perl shop' in
that we rely on perl for everything so far. You will work closely with Perl
developers, product manager and marketeers to identify opportunities,
prototype ideas and turn these concepts into reality. You will be
instrumental in growing Adzuna’s user base from millions of monthly users
to tens and hundreds of millions in the next few years.

We offer a fun, entrepreneurial working environment where Perl is the
development language of choice. Ours is a high-growth business where every
team member can make a huge difference.
