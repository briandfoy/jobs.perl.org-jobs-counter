Job title: Perl/Linux/Web Software Developer

Company name: TAG Online, Inc.

Location: Clifton, NJ, United States

Pay rate:
Compensation dependent on experience and qualifications.

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Technical professional in an established Internet business.

Successful candidates will be involved in the full cycle of development of
custom and customized web applications for TAG Online's clients. The
majority of our development involves a combination of Perl (typically with
mod_perl), PHP, JavaScript, HTML5 and SQL on Linux platforms. This work is
done in small teams, and involves direct contact with customers for initial
analysis and delivery of releases. Of key import is the ability to
communicate well, both with clients and coworkers.

TAG Online also maintains a data center, and candidates may participate in
the management of the networks and systems within.

A love of "puzzles" is a definite plus as clients occasionally need help
with potentially obscure problems that their local ISPs can not or will not
handle. This can involve in-depth digging through log files, testing of
local and distant networks and various other forms of research as a part of
the process, and the ability to solve these puzzles is an important part of
the job.

If you've a passion for detailed and high quality work that is an
expression of yourself, this is an excellent opportunity. We are looking
for enthusiastic people to become part of the TAG team.

Required skills:
- Minimum of 4 years of schooling in a computer-related field, or the
professional equivalent
- Solid knowledge of the Internet and the World Wide Web
- Strong background in UNIX (Linux and/or Solaris)
- Experience working as a part of a development team
- Experience trouble-shooting

Ability to program in:
  - HTML
  - Perl or PHP
  - SQL
  - JavaScript (using AJAX)

- Ability to operate as both a self-starter and team player
- Good people and communication skills
- Eagerness to learn and a love of technology

Familiarity with:
  - Apache (mod_perl would be very helpful)
  - OO Methods
  - Some non-empty subset of Java, C++, C
  - WordPress
  - Drupal
  - Joomla
