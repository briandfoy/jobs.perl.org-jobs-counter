Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
You'll be joining a small team working on a variety of projects related to
network operations. The network is a pretty large/sophisticated high-speed
wide-area network that presents lots of interesting operational challenges.


Recent/current projects include:
 - "network health report" system monitoring availability of the network
backbone
 - "Weathermap" to capture and display network bandwidth
 - trouble ticket system
 - sophisticated contact management/notification system

Projects are a mix of from-scratch and add-on/integration to existing
tools.

We are "wholistic" programmers/designers: we create tools that are easy to
incorporate into the work-flow because they work "right".

Work schedule is flexible, 10+ hours per week, more if you're able.
Telecommute from anywhere (US preferred).

Required skills:
- solid Perl programming in Web and command-line environments
- MySQL
- Linux
- JavaScript, CSS, HTML, AJAX
- Work effectively with minimal oversight
- Ability to "run with" general direction


Desired skills:
- jQuery
- SNMP
- Expect
- Experience with, or familiarity with, Network Operations environment
- Picky (in a productive way) about usability
