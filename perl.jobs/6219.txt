Description:
IODA, the Independent Online Distribution Alliance, is looking for a Senior
Software Development Manager to join our small team of developers. IODA is
the leading independent music digital distribution company, enabling
independent labels to manage their catalog on services such as iTunes,
Rhapsody and eMusic. IODA is also enabling labels to connect directly with
bloggers and podcasters, making it easy for them to feature selected
content.

This is an ideal position for a creative, talented, development manager who
wants to make an impact on a growing company. There's a lot to do, and we
want to do it in the smartest way possible (while working in an agile
manner) to become a force in the media business by offering world-class
technology to our clients. We are a LAMP development house (Linux, Apache,
MySQL, Perl/PHP.), and our team is heavily focused on OO design/development
(OO-Perl) with additional emphasis on database design and large-scale data
management.

The ideal candidate for this position will have a proven track record of
managing and mentoring small teams of developers, and delivering
functionally-rich software in a fast-paced environment. 

We offer:

Music-focused environment that is highly challenging and rewarding, yet
also creative and relaxed.

Competitive compensation.

As an equal opportunity employer, we hire without consideration to race,
religion, creed, color, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation,
marital status, veteran status or disability.

Required skills:
Minimum 1-3 years of “hands on” management and technical mentoring
experience for small- to medium-sized teams

5+ years of OO Analysis and Design in a Unix/Linux environment with an
emphasis on server development in OO Perl, C++, Python or Ruby (OO Perl is
strongly preferred)

Deep understanding of complex data structures and a successful track record
working in data-driven environments

Understanding of advanced RDBMS concepts for large-scale back-ends

Prior “start-up” experience desired

Experience with agile development methodologies (e.g., Scrum)

Experience with refactoring, test-driven development and other agile
software development practices

BS in Computer Science or other Engineering/Scientific discipline (Masters
preferred)

A passion for music, a healthy disregard for the status quo, and a creative
attitude
