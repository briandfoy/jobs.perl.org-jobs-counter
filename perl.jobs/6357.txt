Job title: Advanced - Linux Perl Programmer

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We're looking for a perl programmer that has PERL experience and that is
able to finish projects. We sometimes have old scripts that need to be
completely rewritten from scratch. 

No shortcuts must be taken on programming scripts... or rebuilding them
from scratch

The projects will vary but will always be around PERL and Linux, so
knowledge of Linux administration is also a key in this. 

Please only reply if you meet the "Description and Required Skills" we have
been through many programmers and we need someone reliable -- you will be
paid highly + bonuses for your work -- but MUST BE Reliable. 

Must be available via some sort of chat protocol (MSN, ICQ, YIM, Skype,
gtalk *something*)

Required skills:
Linux administration 
Perl programming (obviously) 
cPanel knowledge (not 100% needed but if you know makes it simpler a
little).

Willing to work in a team, and to set a time line and complete it within
the time frames +/- 

Just be motivated and keep up with replies to projects and  give status
updates.
