Job title: Perl Modifications for Request Tracker

Company name: N/A

Internal ID: N/A

Pay rate: Fixed per job, negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Short Job

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are switching over to use Request Tracker (http://bestpractical.com/rt/)
which is a perl based Helpdesk System.

There are a few modifications I would like to implement.

This job would involve downloading the same version of RT we use (v4.0.1)
and itemizing the various changes we need to implement by either patch
files or within a document (informal is OK).

There are many changes we want to implement, though for starters we want to
implement..

1. Ability to login using either the password associated with the user
account or alternatively with one of the ticket number associated to the
user account (this can be done via adjusting an SQL query)

2. Ability to send two different auto-responses to tickets, based on who
the ticket is going to. Currenty RT let's you specify one standard response
for all tickets, we want to set this up so that we have some sort of lookup
table so that it checks who it is responding to and ten sends an
auto-response based on the sender

3. Develop the ability to generate weekly reports (triggered by crontab).
Reports should outline outstanding tickets per organisation and generate an
email with a PDF version of the report. 
We have looked into doing this and there is a binary that comes with
Request Tracker which allows you to query the DB for these sorts of things.
Here is a sample script which uses the binary to pull out a list of tasks
with a due date -

This job is per hour negotiable. Please advise of your rate and any
relevant experience.
