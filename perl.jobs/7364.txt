Job title:
Perl and C long-term/temp-to-perm contract

Company name: Vivox, Inc

Location: United States, MA, Framingham

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
What you will be doing: building a Perl-based test harness for automation
that exercises the functions and structs in a C-based library that will be
run/supported on Mac, Linux and Windows

The two major pieces of the project are the following:
1. An extendable, scriptable interface to a C-based library used to carry
real-time audio and text messaging from servers to clients. The scriptable
interface will be used to build Perl-based test automation suites
- state machine will hold finite but dynamic set of variables and must be
queryable
- machine will run on Linux, Mac and Windows
- SWIG will be used to "make" the scriptable interface into something Perl
can digest.

2. An extendable, flexible test harness that uses the scripting interface
to the C-library and Perl to build:
- atomic testcases for individual API call testing
- bundles of API calls for executing end-to-end actions
- has timers for event-based tests
- can be easily extended to multi-client scenarios

While this will be a very independent position, you will be working
primarily with the lead developer for the library and the QA manager to
create the tool design. This work will graduate to building multi-client
test scenarios that test longevity and long-term stability with common
activities. Once the harness is written, there is an endless sea of simple
to very complex test scenarios involving anywhere from 1 to
name-your-favorite-big-number of clients across the three main platforms.

Required skills:
- Perl Programming, experience using 
   - Test::Simple, More, Deep
   - SWIG to wrap C structs, functions, etc.
- C/C++ Programming
- making multi-client/remote client controllers
- strong familiarity with testing methodology
- 8-10 years of programming experience
