Job title:
Perl Programmer (Catalyst, DBIx::Class) in Amsterdam

Company name: Mintlab B.V.

Internal ID: 1

Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands

Pay rate: Salary and Bonus (euro)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Mintlab is a young dynamic enterprise, which from its start in 2010 has
made it its mission to develop the most advanced and innovative
'zaaksysteem' (business system) in the market today, designed for
government institutions and large corporations. This system (
http://www.zaaksysteem.nl/ ) enables them to digitalize their business
processes in a simple way from A-Z. Mintlab is characterized by strongly
motivated people, healthy growth, trained professionals and an open
informal atmosphere. 

The creative programmer that you are is an enrichment for the team, This is
achieved by improving the quality of the 'zaaksysteem' and constantly
adding new features in close cooperation with the architect of the system.
As part of our young company you will have plenty of possibilities to
initiate and present your own ideas.

Because of the complexity of the code and the drive of our team to go the
distance in order to deliver the best conceivable features we are looking
for an experienced and passionate developer, who is able to approach any
challenge in a pragmatic fashion. You are not afraid to research and apply
new techniques to add to the 'zaaksysteem' just that extra bit of vibe. We
are developing both in server side and client side languages and make use
of the latest developments to make our software both progressive, while
keeping it user-friendly at the same time.
In short: you will cooperate closely with us towards the so called 'road
map to awareness'. The tangible evidence of our success is a fourfold
increase in users over the past year alone.

Required skills:
• Fluent in Perl (minimum of 3 years experience)
• Knowledge of DBIx::Class, Catalyst
• Knowledge of clientside programming and (X)HTML, CSS, jQuery
• Knowledge in the development of webbased applications on a Linux-platform

• Knowledge and experience with various database platforms
• You are able to think conceptually and are able to function independently
within a team.
• Knowledge and experience with the development of interfaces and how to
make connection between various applications and/or frameworks.
