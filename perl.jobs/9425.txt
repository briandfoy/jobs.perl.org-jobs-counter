Job title: Programming/Automation

Location: United States, CA, San Diego

Pay rate: $ - open based on experience

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Min 6 months...possibility of 

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Basically, the job is going to involve scripting in a big way. I can’t have
someone doing on-the-job training, but also realize that I won’t be getting
a superstar with 20 years experience, either.

The two big scripting languages I’m looking for are PERL and PHP. My
primary need is for PERL. However, anybody that has the requisite
experience level I need in PERL will also have experience in one or more
other scripting languages, as picking up another scripting language is
inevitable after you learn one.

The list of skills I need are as follows, in order:
1) PERL
2) PHP
3) PYTHON or TCL or RUBY (not directly useful to me, but illustrates the
depth of experience of the candidate).
4) JAVA is a good thing.
5) “SHELL” SCRIPTING – but honestly, all of these (CSH, TCSH, KORN shell,
etc) are more or less obsolete so we’d be scraping the bottom of the barrel
if this is all they have besides PERL.
6) HTML and other Web technologies like APACHE

As far as languages like C, C++, C#, or JAVA go – these aren’t so useful.
Neither really is JAVA, but it is far more useful than any of the ‘C’ type
languages.

Desired skills:
Configuration Management experience, aka build and release engineering –
nice to have, that is in fact the job, but really this is a
programming/automation job that happens to be dabbling in Configuration
Management, not the other way around.

PERFORCE, though experience with ClearCase is good as well if I can verify
that they scripted around it. Otherwise, in itself it doesn’t help much. 

Familiarity with COM and OLE via scripting would be nice, but usually this
won’t be known till the interview.
