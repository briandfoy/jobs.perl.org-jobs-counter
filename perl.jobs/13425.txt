Job title: Geek (Software Engineer)

Company name: GüdTech

Location: San Diego, CA, USA

Pay rate: $50,000 - $150,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Now Hiring Geeks!
Yes, that’s the official title. Some people call them “Software Engineers”
– We think that’s boring.


Solving problems is the name of the game. As a small, lean-and-mean tech
team, we’re responsible for making the rubber hit the road with minimum
bullshit and pointy-headed management to get in the way. From
conceptualization, to implementation, to deployment, we do things a little
differently. If you want some cushy job where you trundle along not really
doing much of consequence, then this is not the job for you; However, if
you seek a challenge, not only in terms of personal growth but also the
ability to effect change, then read on!

What We Offer.
-Paid Interview Opportunity. We make educated decisions, and you should
too. Making a career move is a big deal. By using a small project as part
of the interview process, both parties can make a more informed choice.
Make sure there’s water in the pool before you jump! You get a good feel
for the technology, and we get to know you better.
-Competitive compensation.  Our compensation packages are competitive AND
comprehensive – 100% Medical, Dental, Vision premiums – We’ve got you
covered!
-Life/Work Balance.  Quality work product comes from happy, balanced
individuals.
-Workstation Choice.  Linux, OSX, or even (ghasp!) Windows.  Productivity
and making great software is all that matters.

Required skills:
You Should Be:
A Great communicator.  Through precision, eloquence, and candor, we aspire
to greatness.
A Self starter.  Taking initiative and seeing things through to completion
is kind of our thing.
Passionate about software.  We believe that passion for a quality product
is the only way to achieve positive, sustainable outcomes with software.
You should too.

Gotta-Haves:
A robust understanding of foundational web technologies.
Experience with Open Source platforms like Linux.
The ability to educate yourself as needed to get the job done.
The ability to strike a balance between pragmatism and idealism.

Desired skills:
Nice-to-Haves
Proficiency in Perl, JavaScript, ExtJS and SQL.
Experience with web-scale software.
