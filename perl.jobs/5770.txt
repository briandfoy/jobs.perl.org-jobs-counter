Description:
The European Technical Competence Centre (ETCC) was formed in West London

European sales subsidiaries. Supporting wireless/microwave radio equipment
sales and business development activities, the team undertakes a
combination of pre-sales and after-sales functions. 

The ETCC supports the subsidiaries in developing a strong position in the

and technical support for business development activities in Europe,
focusing on the NEC NMS systems PNMT/S, PNMT/S J, PC-MG, Trap Converter,
New SNMP Dial up solution and NMS integration onto northbound.

Pre-sales activities will include technical bid management, technical
proposals and NMS DCN design. Post-sales support tasks will include joining
the rota to provide 24/7 helpdesk support for the NMS.

Required skills:
Candidates must be educated to degree level in Software Engineering or
Computer Science disciplines and be able to demonstrate knowledge of Perl.

In addition, candidates must demonstrate strong communication skills, a
willingness to learn and the ability to produce a high standard of
documentation. 

Candidates must also be able to work and travel within the UK and Europe at
short notice, therefore only candidates with EU passports can be considered
for this role.

Desired skills:
Knowledge of Python, Unix, SNMP and software design knowledge would be an
advantage but are not essential.
