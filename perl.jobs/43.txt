Hello,
My name is Rob Shelton, and I am a perl programmer.
(everyone say in unison "Hi Rob")
The last time I used perl was this afternoon, when I
finished writing a generic perl interface to
e-commerce providers.
I also have programmed perl to work with MySQL which I
also know to well. I tryed not to, but I had to. I
wrote perl code to connect to any number of MySQL
databases at the Same time! I have generated reports,
I created signup forms, I wrote perl code that allows
many webservers to work together, I even wrote code
that makes my clients Money! I feel so ashamed!

LOL, Anyways, back to reality.
I have done all that, and more. Im not the best, but
not the cheapest. If you need work done, let me know. 
Or even if you need some ideas on where to start with
your perl/internet project, just drop me a line.

Talk to you soon, Hope you got a good laugh!

Rob
