Job title: Superb Perl Developer for High Traffic Website

Company name: Acumen PI aka The Student Room

Location: United Kingdom, East Sussex, Brighton

Pay rate:
£32,000-£40,000 + generous contributory pension, family health insurance,
25 days holiday, training 

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Acumen PI is a dynamic and fast growing publisher of two of the world’s
largest student websites. From our converted grain store in the vibrant
North Laine area of Brighton, we are seeking an experienced, passionate and
independent-minded Perl Developer to lead web development on the largest
student website in the world.

You will report to the Technical Director, and be excited by the
opportunity to really stamp your own mark, as our first in-house lead Perl
Developer.

About Us:
Acumen PI is a small, passionate company with 16 employees and an annual
turnover of £2 Million. Founded in 2001, we have steadily and profitably
grown our two main sites which now receive around 4 million unique visitors
per month: www.thestudentroom.co.uk and www.coursework.info

The Student Room is well established as the largest student community in
the world. Students aged 14-24 use the site for academic and emotional
support from their peers, fun and making friends. In the last few months
the Prime Minister, the leaders of all the main political parties and Lord
Browne, have all conducted Q&As with the UK’s students on our site.

Coursework.Info is the UK’s largest academic coursework library. It is
endorsed by teachers and the academic community at large. We work closely
with the academic community and the government-supported Turnitin
plagiarism detection software to ensure all our model coursework is used as
a valuable academic aid.

For a number of years our web development and hosting has been outsourced
to a company based in Canada with whom we have regular video conferences.
We have now decided to bring the technical capability in house. 

Job Description:
Coursework is a highly customized and extended version of Gossamer Links -
a Perl Framework. You will need to take total ownership of the codebase in
order to understand completely the inner workings of the site, including:

• The management of over 180,000 documents, including document conversion
and categorisation process.
• Integration with our own Google Search Appliance.
• Our bespoke payment system integrating with Datacash, Paypal and
WorldPay.
• The optimisation and fine-tuning required to enable over 1 million unique
visitors each month to access the site.

Our current development partner will help us in this transition and there
may be trips to Canada during the knowledge transfer.
Going forward, working with the Technical Director and the rest of the
technical team, you will:


• Lead on all technical developments for Coursework.info.
• Scope, design and deliver all new Perl developments.
• Maintain the existing codebase.
• Provide great technical insight and great documentation.
• Mentor junior members of the team.
• Be a champion for quality assurance throughout the role.


Additional Information:
• A great working environment.
• A real opportunity to define your role.
• Dedicated R&D time each week.
• Knowledge that your designs and implementations will be used by millions
of people each week.


Required skills:
• A good Computer Science degree or equivalent.
• A number of years experience in commercial web development in an
established team.
• Solid programming experience in perl/mod_perl.
• Strong MySQL database design and complex query generation and
optimisation.
• Great communication skills and a professional and friendly manner.
• Confidence to work independently and under own initiative.

Desired skills:
• Experience of high traffic websites.
• Experience of e-commerce integration and development.
• Other languages: PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
• PCI compliance.
• Virtualisation
• SVN, Git.
• GAS, Varnish, Wine, Crossover Office.
• Pagespeed, YSlow.
