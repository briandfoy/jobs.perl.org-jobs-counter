necessarily Perl.
- Familiarity with "modern" Perl: exposure to any of the
following beneficial (Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Moose, Dancer, Mojilicious)

Confident experience building reliable software using unit testing,
functional testing, and continuous integration (experience with
jenkins/hudson or similar platforms would be helpful)
- Strong
communicator, able to discuss future projects as well as existing ones with
members of staff with varying levels of technical understanding.  
- Good
overall understanding of all aspects of server software deployment, from
TCP/IP to HTTP to IO bottlenecks.

web applications)
