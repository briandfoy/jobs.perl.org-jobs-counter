Job title: Perl and Java Developers

Company name: Utiba

Internal ID: Perldev_264

Location: Australia, Victoria, Melbourne

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Description:
Pre paid mobile technology - Global business
We are looking for Perl and Java developers with 2 to 5 years experience.

Utiba is a well established software development company specializing in
mobile communications, micro-payment & financial services for a growing
customer base across S-E Asia, Asia and expanding regions.

Working in partnership with telecommunications operators, developers at
Utiba are expanding the potential of the mobile phone as a business tool, a
bank and a phone.

Our applications are used by 10 million people globally every day – to
recharge their mobile phone, pay their bills, buy mobile content
(ringtones, games, etc), transfer money to family and friends – all using
SMS technology. Utiba’s solutions are realizing the “mobile wallet”. 

So here’s your chance to do some pretty cool stuff for a completely
different customer base and at the same time understand a whole new culture
and way of doing things.  You get to travel occasionally, too.

Although we are global, our architecture and core development is done by an
established and successful team here in Melbourne. Utiba’s architecture is
a high volume financial system designed to work in a telecommunications
environment. Utilising open source software, we develop transaction
processing solutions handling SMS and micro-payments.

We have a relaxed working environment, plenty of projects on the go and our
growth presents great opportunities for rapid progression.

Required skills:
* Minimum of 1-2 years commercial development experience
* Object Oriented coding skills in Perl and/or Java (J2SE)
* Experience in relational databases design & SQL programming; (Oracle,
Sybase, Postgres favoured)
* Development experience on Unix and/or Linux
