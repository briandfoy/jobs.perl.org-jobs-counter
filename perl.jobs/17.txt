First Quadrant Job Description

Job Title:  Programmer, Equity Portfolio Engineering
Reports To: Partner responsible for Equity PE

Summary:    Responsible for developing and enhancing software for Equity 
portfolio construction.  First Quadrant is a global asset manager whose 
portfolios are built solely with advanced quantitative techniques, and our 
business depends on the quality and effectiveness of our proprietary software.  
Work is done in an informal, small team environment, using rapid development 
techniques and coding almost exclusively in PERL.  Hours are flexible, and the 
pace is intense.  Though we manage almost $30 billion in assets, our entire 
firm has under 100 people. We seek very bright people who want 
to enjoy their jobs, who like working closely with others, who have shown that 
they learn and adapt very quickly, and who will get satisfaction from doing 
great work fast.

Duties and Responsibilities:
1. On a project basis, performs systems design, coding, testing, documentation,
   and implementation activities as required.
2. Supports and extends existing First Quadrant software for Equity Portfolio 
   Engineering (this software is written almost entirely in PERL and runs in 
   the Sun Solaris/Linux environment).

Supervisory Responsibilities:
None.

Qualifications:
1. Must have at least 2 years of hands-on business programming experience.
2. Either must have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a closely 
   related field from a four-year college or university, or have directly 
   equivalent experience.
3. Must have a working knowledge of PERL, UNIX and object-oriented design.  
   Experience using PERL on a large-scale UNIX server-side project would be a 
   major advantage.
4. Must have demonstrated the ability to work collaboratively with other 
   programmers, systems administrators, and a variety of people within an 
   organization's business units.
5. Knowledge of the securities industry would be an advantage.

Compensation:
Initial base salary depends on qualifications. Will participate in company 
bonus and benefits/insurance plans.
