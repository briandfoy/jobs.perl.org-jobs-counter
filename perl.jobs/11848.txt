Job title: Invoicing App - PDF Creation Subroutine for Perl

Company name: Quonix Networks, Inc

Location: Philadelphia, PA

Pay rate: Project Bid

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are developing an in-house billing and accounting system. This posting
is not related to that project, rather its related to one programmatic
aspect of our billing project that we are having difficulty in - PDF
creation of invoices from field data in a SQL database.

In its most basic form, we are looking for a developer that can write a
subroutine that takes a few inputs, and from those inputs generates a PDF
file. The inputs would be filename and path of where to write the file, and
a hash reference to a hash table that contains all the name:value pairs for
all the data on the invoice. Every piece of text on that invoice is
identified and included in the hash.

The only requirement is the PDF being generated has to look like our
current invoice, so there is alot of text alignment, a graphical logo,
lines, boxes, etc.,. A sample PDF can be provided before you bid on the
project.

Required skills:
Extremely proficient in Perl on Linux platform and PDF manipulation through
CPAN modules like PDF::API2.

Desired skills:
Some basic understanding of invoicing is nice, but not required. We will
give you a hash with all the data, and sample invoice to copy look and
feel.
