Job title: Fill Justification Subroutine Programmer

Company name: PushButtonPress.com, Inc.

Location: United States, CT, Greenwich

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Help Please,

I am a PERL programmer who has an immediate need for an
algorithm/subroutine to do full fill justification of proportional width
fonts.

In other words, I need to be able to call the subroutine, pass it the
following variables (begin string, end string, fill character, font, size,
style, width of column) and get the ouput returned as a properly formatted
string. The width could be specified in pixels, inches, or whatever makes
sense.

ex:

&fill_justify("hello", "I am", ".", "Times Roman", "14", 
"40");

print "$output\n";

&fill_justify("how are you?", "fine", "Times Roman", "14", 
"40");

print "$output\n";


results in: 

hello..............................I am
how are you?................fine

* Note that on my screen the above two lines are fully 
justified on both sides.

I've gotten this routine to work just fine with fixed-width 
fonts like courier, but not with proportional like times or arial. WrapProp
from CPAN didn't work right and I've tried everything else I can think of.
My deadline is 
overdue and I have too much riding on this so it really 
needs to work yesterday.

I would greatly appreciate any help you might be able to send my way and
may be able to help you sometime.

Let me know if you know of a quick way to do this, and if you need anything
from me, to do so.

Thanks in advance for your consideration, and for any 
assistance you might be able to render.

In hopeful expectation of a miracle,

P.S. At this point it just needs to work, I don't even care if I have to
use the system command to send the 
parameters to a separate program. 

P.P.S. I am running Linux Mandrake 8.0 with all the 
trimmings and can configure the machine however it 
needs to be in order for this to work.

P.P.P.S. I know that this is possible as open source programs such as Star
Office, LyX and KWord can do full justification - I don't know C and so I'd
need someone else to find out how they do it and adapt the algorithm
appropriately.

Required skills:
ability to do full fill justification of proportional width fonts
