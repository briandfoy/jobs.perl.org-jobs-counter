Job title: Senior Perl Developer (London)

Company name: Adestra

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Competitive!

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for a bright, enthusiastic, experienced Perl developer to
join our Oxford-based team to assist with the ongoing development of
MessageFocus - our web-based email marketing platform.

Here's a bit of information about our codebase and how we work:

We use Catalyst as the framework for our main application server, and we
have another (very high volume and much more specialised) webserver running
Starman (a pure-Perl Plack-based webserver). Almost everything passes
through one of those two systems. Our ORM layer uses DBIx::Class, and
pretty much everything else is a Moose class.

Unlike many Perl codebases these days, we don't have much nasty old code -
very little of it is over 3 years old (we did a ground-up rewrite of our
application layer a few years back). Maybe more importantly, we prioritise
code quality and maintainability over releasing features quickly, so it's
generally a nice codebase to work on.

We're constantly looking for ways to improve what we do, so we're pushing
heavily to improve our processes by employing things like Modern Perl
techniques, and test-driven development where we can. We're a fast moving,
small team willing to make changes where necessary to make the best product
we can.

Come join us!

Day to day work can include anything and everything from database schema
design and optimisation, high-throughput scaling work, to UI/UX design,
to.. almost anything else. One of the biggest benefits of working in a
small team is you'll be able to try your hand at a lot of new interesting
things!

Required skills:
Successful candidates would ideally be experienced Perl programmers,
although we're willing to consider someone with experience with a similar
language and a willingness to learn Perl (we promise that Modern Perl is a
lot nicer than the Perl of yesteryear). We would expect at least some
experience with creating web-based applications.

 * Perl, of course
 * SQL/NoSQL Databases
 * Web-based application development
 * API design

Desired skills:
Here are some of the technologies we use heavily, experience with any of
these would be very beneficial:

 * Moose
 * Catalyst
 * PSGI/Plack
 * DBIx::Class
 * PostgreSQL
 * FreeBSD
 * SQL and PL/PGSQL
 * JavaScript
 * UI/UX design
