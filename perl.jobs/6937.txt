Company Description
***************************
IntApp, Inc. is a privately held software company based in Palo Alto
(conveniently located next to Fry’s Electronics). Founded in 2000 and
profitable for five years, we offer powerful integration technology that
enables software applications that were not designed to work together to
share information.

The opportunities for our core technology span multiple markets. Today, we
focus primarily on the legal market, helping law firms to maximize billable
hours, optimize internal operations, and control access to sensitive
information.

Our leadership team includes seasoned entrepreneurs with a history of
building successful technology companies. For instance, John Hall, our CEO,
was a co-founder of VA Linux and helped lead the company to one of the most
successful IPOs in history. We’re growing, and we’re looking for smart,
hard-working people to fuel our growth.

Our corporate culture rewards and encourages hard work, open communication,
and teamwork. Everyone here is passionate about making our customers
successful through superior technology, products and support.

***************************
Job Description
***************************
Our product is a platform that defines how data should be moved between
many different sources such as databases, LDAP servers, and remote file
systems. It allows users to manipulate data with our high-level graphical
programming language.

As one of our key developers, you will use Perl to design, implement, and
maintain the back end for this tool. Your responsibility will be creating
code that can robustly handle critical customer data without sacrificing
the ease of use that has made our product successful.

Our goal is to allow users to utilize such features as control flow, error
handling, data persistence, and concurrency -- without having extensive
programming experience.

We are altering how our customers approach integration, and we need someone
capable of helping us advance the technology even further. 

Desired skills:
* M.S. and/or B.S. degree in Computer Science
* Object-oriented software development experience
* Perl 5 (not required)
* Excellent communication skills
* Skills in as many of the following areas as possible: DBI, SQL, Apache,
CGI/modperl, XML-RPC, SOAP, HTTP, LDAP, SSL, MySQL
* Desire to grow personally and professionally
