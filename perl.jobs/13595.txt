Job title: Team Leader / Senior Developer / Architect

Company name: Broadbean Technology Ltd

Internal ID: INTARC

Location: Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: Excellent

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
** YOU MUST ALREADY BE ELIGIBLE TO WORK IN THE UK. NO RECRUITERS, PLEASE **


We're looking for a talented Senior Developer to help lead a team of three
in our lovely Canary Wharf offices. You'll be working on a new codebase,
and helping create another, so you'll be able to influence the technologies
we use, and will be responsbile for the architecture of the resulting
products.

The existing codebase is built on DBIx::Class and Dancer on Plack, has a
reasonable test-suite, is deployable via Jenkins, and you'll be sat three
seats away from the (exceptionally nice) Product Owner. The new codebase is
a series of API integrations, and you'll be helping our developer in this
role plan and execute their solutions.

We're a small company (90 people in the UK), owned by a very big company,
and a great place to work. Post-probation we offer (non-contractually)
flexible working and 50% telecommuting. We've got a development team of 30
and are fully committed to Perl, clearing our technical debt, and doing
things the right way moving forward...

Required skills:
You'll need to show proof of strong and "Modern" Perl - at least
familiarity with various testing modules, exposure to Moose would be
useful. You should have opinions that you can justify on the "right" level
of testing, and the pros and cons of continuous delivery. You can take a
stab at the philosophical differences between Catalyst, Dancer, and
Mojolicious.
