Job title: Development Engineer

Company name: Citysearch

Internal ID: LA DE

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: Four weeks

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Responsibilities:
HTML/Perl/Template modification: Modify existing CitySearch site templates
to incorporate new functionality and user interface (UI) elements.
Candidate will be responsible for acting as the "glue" between the product
design team and core developers, and will integrate the new back end code
and new user interface elements into customized templates based on
CitySearch’s custom template system. Graphic and design skills are not
required and will not be a major component of the job function.

Problem Solving and Support: Excellent problem-solving skills are
essential. Integration of the backend and UI elements may require re-coding
for successful integration. Introduced bugs must be tested for, tracked,
and resolved.

Documentation: Will be expected to document changes made to templates for
internal project tracking.

Education / Experience:
High school diploma required, college degree preferred.



Required skills:
Required:
HTML:Proficiency in HTML is required including unique browser/platform
issues. Majority of HTML is pre-existing (prepared by the UI group as
mock-ups) but customization will be required to incorporate new
graphics/content and functionality and generate dynamic templates. Handling
of complex HTML table structures is required. 

Perl: Exposure to Perl would be ideal. Template system is Perl-based and
can be learned on-the-job. Exposure to an application server language
(Perl, ASP, PHP, Python) or experience with a templating engine is
required. 

Excellent Communication/Work Skills: This position will require excellent
communication skills, both written and verbal, since this position is the
meeting point between the core developers and the UI team members. Must be
self-motivated, independent, organized, and have the desire to be a strong
team player with a goal of team success.



Desired skills:
Preferred:
General knowledge of web technologies: Exposure to an array of web
technologies and techniques (HTML, javascript, scripting languages) is a
plus.

Experience with database-driven web development: Since templates are based
on database stored content, experience working with databases, especially
as a web backend, is a big plus.

Positives:
Great opportunity to perfect one’s HTML skills and learn a template-based
content management system in a large-scale, high volume, web development
environment.

Exposure to perl-based template system, and direct interaction with the
backend customization team members, will give this position great exposure
to Perl in a production environment.

Small, highly interdependent team within a large, stable, web organization.
