Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Agile Informatics

Internal ID: PDP-521

Location: United States, California, Fremont

Pay rate: 40

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 12 Months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Position: Perl Developer 
Duration: +6 Months & Extendable
Location: San Francisco, CA 

Perl Developer, Perl, Senior Perl Developer, Perl Admin, C++, UI, Perl, 
Description:
UI/Perl/DB/C++/Email Consultant
We need Perl skills for Admin Console and user management. This is not very
much UI at all and is mostly maintenance so there is actually very little
UI development, and our UI is very simple HTML with nothing fancy (no
client side JavaScript coding). It will be primarily Perl and working with
existing features that include user management, user sync between systems
including some SSO, security related changes, reporting, bug fixes, etc. A
mix of the usual tasks of these types of systems. 

I wouldn't require significant HTML or UI experience, it's mostly Perl and
the ability to jump into existing code and make enhancements, fix bugs and
add some features. For a talented individual they could work on a more
substantial new feature.

If they have some email experience that would help, but generally this
position is more about users/orgs configuration & reporting data than email
flow. Grit and determination are just as important for this position, I
just need someone willing to take on a variety of things and get them
accomplished quickly. 

A position for C++/email is probably separate, but if someone has these
additional skills that would allow more flexibility, but I wouldn't focus
on this combo, and can get this more easily in-house than the Perl skills. 

Required skills:
Perl, C++, Email, Advance Perl , Perl Developer, 

Desired skills:
Perl, C++, Email, Advance Perl , Perl Developer,
