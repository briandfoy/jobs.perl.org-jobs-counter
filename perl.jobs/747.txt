Job title: mod_perl / postgres programmer/architect

Company name: PeopleSight

Internal ID: rd02

Location: United States, CA, Newport Beach

Pay rate: not bad

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We need senior perl programmer with systems architecture / project lead
experience wanted to help design and build the core application and systems
infrastructure for a services company.	You should be comfortable creating
and maintaining lots of requirements, systems, and process documentation as
well as doing the usual architect / programmer code bits.  Solid skills are
essential (this is a hit-the-ground-running gig) but intelligence,
sociability, and a broad range of experience(s) are more important than a
particular list of acronyms.

Required skills:
-- mod_perl
-- significant Oracle and/or Postgres experience (including schema design
and optimization, stored procedures, etc)
-- XML experience (XML::LibXML preferred).
-- a willingness to play well with others, both coders and nontechnical
folk.
-- experience working with a team of greater than 2 people designing and
building large applications in perl; dot-com horror stories are acceptable.

-- ability to survive in Orange County, CA

Desired skills:
Experience with and insights into robust intelligent caching / filtering
systems would be a big plus.  A previous life as a DBA, UNIX/Linux Sysadmin
or deployment engineer would be just spiffy, and a familiarity with mac osX
as a development platform is nice.
