Description:
Genius’ Service engineering group is looking for an A+, hands-on,

• Ability to code and debug and parse Javascript.
• Advance knowledge of regular expression.
• Must understand the difference between Apache 1.x and Apache 2.x.

• Not only love to program but thrive in a fast-paced environment.
• Are self-directed but also know how to communicate with your teammates.
• Have a strong familiarity with version control, bug tracking and IDEs.
• Believe in making your code fault-tolerant, robust, and high-performance.


Nice to have:
