Job title: Lifecycle Architect

Company name: UBS Australia

Location: Australia, NSW, Sydney

Pay rate: AUD Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent Position

Hours: Full time

Description:
Role Overview
This role is to take ownership of all lifecycle tools and processes,
working in the Infrastructure team within
Equity Research and Distribution (ERD), a function of Equities IT. ERD IT
is responsible for the construction
of a number of bespoke applications to facilitate the production and
distribution of Equity research. 
These applications are developed using a range of languages, tools and
platforms. There is a clear requirement to
further improve the software development process by providing tools to
automate and standardise various aspects of the lifecycle.

Primary Responsibilities
This important role in the department covers the ownership and strategy of
all aspects of the software development lifecycle, together with an
infrastructure for promoting re-use, across the department.  More
specifically:

•	A suite of tools and process documentation to support software
development called the Common Development Lifecycle (CDL) was produced some
time ago and is still used extensively within ERD. However, support for CDL
has lapsed for a significant period. Take ownership of CDL. Prune those
areas no longer relevant to ERD. Review the consistency of code and
documentation, make the necessary changes and distribute a new release.
•	Since ownership of CDL passed to an external group, a number of
new, standalone tools have been developed within ERD. Take ownership of
these tools and assimilate them within the CDL framework.
•	Improve the support of CDL for development on the Windows platform.

•	The development of lifecycle tools will require contributions from
other development staff in ERD. For example, a currently ongoing piece of
work is to migrate CDL's support for building Java software from Ant to
Maven. Manage this contribution process and ensure that all submitted
components fit seamlessly into the overall direction.
•	Take requirements from within ERD for entirely new work on
lifecycle tools. Manage the planning and prioritisation of this work. Keep
management informed with regular reports on progress and deliverables.

This role is dedicated to full time work on the above tasks. However, ERD
Infrastructure is a small team. Understand the rest of the team's work
sufficiently well to be able to provide help and support in other areas as
required.
 
Our Company

securities business, providing a full spectrum of services to corporate and
institutional clients, governments and financial intermediaries. The

comprehensive access to the world's capital markets. 

Our Offering
At UBS, initiative and client focus are always recognised and rewarded. You
can expect to share in the rewards of our success, benefits from continuous
professional development and enjoy a vibrant and dynamic working
environment. With operations in over 50 countries, we can also offer
international opportunities.


Required skills:
•	Detailed knowledge of Perl, since almost all of the software in
this area is written in that language.	By way of illustration, if you have
not at least considered contributing software to CPAN, or are not familiar
with the changes in Perl 6, then this is unlikely to be the role for you.
•	Familiarity with a range of lifecycle tools, such as Subversion,
Confluence, JIRA, Gnumake, Maven, CruiseControl and RPM.
•	A sufficiently deep understanding of the challenges inherent in
software development to set a vision and direction for the suite of tools
across the user community.  Rather than a single application, the role
involves working on multiple small to medium sized utilities across the
entire software development lifecycle.	The developer community in ERD
varies from quite inexperienced to expert.


•	Persistent, eager to learn, and hard working
•	A strong communicator, able to work with and gain the confidence of
senior managers across the department.
•	Possessed of extremely strong organisational skills and meticulous
in your approach, able to manage and prioritise work on a large number of
disparate tasks in this problem domain.
