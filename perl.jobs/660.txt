Description:
We've got multiple openings for a project we are deploying to manage the
conversion of some 6 TB of data from an old website to a new, modern
design. All of the conversions are arranged 'by directory' and after
following procedures certain trees do not port to the new environment and
require manual review and repair. 

Your role in this project is to migrate specific directories to the new QA
systems, and run through debug to production. You will serve as third line
support for team leads who do not have the technical ability to complete
the migrations. 

Most of your work will be boiler-plate and template-based. If you are
unable to complete the directory with a given level of effort the task will
be handed off to the fourth-level tier support. 

Your ability to follow instructions, maintain a concerted effort for
quality and consistency in this effort is absolutely essential.
