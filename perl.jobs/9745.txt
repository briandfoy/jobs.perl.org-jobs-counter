Job title: Perl Developer

Internal ID: MI5

Location: United States, MI, Lansing

Pay rate: $50-70/hr DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
My client is a web hoster that is developing a cloud computing service
based on Xen. It is mostly done but they need more Perl developers to
finish it and get it released. I have seen much of the codebase and it
is pretty decent and easy enough to pick up. The major areas of work
needed are with billing, UI and other web related stuff. This is onsite
in Michigan and a full time hourly contract. Pay is from $50-70/hour
depending on experience.

Required skills:
Solid Perl (3+ years)
OO Perl, modules, CPAN use
Sysadmin mentality (this means you understand how a sysadmin would think
about solving problems and then coding that in Perl)

Desired skills:
Usual web stuff (HTML, apache, Javascript, etc.)
Any experience with billing software is a big plus
