Job title: Data Wrangler (Perl/Linux) Opportunity

Company name: Coit Staffing

Location:
United States, CA, Mt View or San Francisco

Pay rate: DOE US$

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:

Our client's search engine can exploit structured data (i.e. lists, feeds)
to do a better job in returning the best web content for a query. The more
structured data we can pour in the top, the better we can refine the
results flowing out of the bottom. Your job will be to lead the effort in
making structured data available throughout their system. 

You will help define and build infrastructure for gathering data from many
sources (web sites, RSS feeds, etc.) and then making this data
programmatically accessible to various client components within the
Searchme back end. 

About our client: A Sequoia Capital backed startup with offices in both San
Francisco and Mountain View poised to shake up the search space. 

Consider the following tasks: 

Write a program to extract the list of current Academy Award winners and
update the existing list in a MySQL database instance. 
Given an RSS feed, write a program to check the feed daily and extract the
title attributes from the stream and dump them into a text file. 
If either of these seems scary, then this isn't the job for you. If you are
already thinking about how these tasks could be a) better specified and b)
easily automated, then this might be a fun job for you. 

Required skills include: 

Perl, Linux, and the ability to write programs that extract data from web
sites. 
You should have experience with text parsing. 
You don't need to be an expert in SQL, but should be comfortable with
getting data into and out of MySQL databases. 
Familiarity with RSS/Atom is a plus, as is basic C/C++ programming skills. 

Clear verbal and written communication skills.
