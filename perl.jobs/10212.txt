Job title: Sr mod_perl2, custom MVC dev/arch

Company name: Golden Guru

Internal ID: 1138a

Location: United States, Washington, Seattle

Pay rate: TBD

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're looking for a truly senior Perl developer and architect to build and
maintain complex web applications and back-end services in a highly custom
mod_perl2/MVC/OOP environment. This is a predominately remote (work from
home) position that pays 1099, typically 40+ hours per week available. Must
be a US citizen or eligible to be paid 1099, have strong English verbal and
written skills, and be able easily attend monthly and sometimes more
frequent day-long meetings in Seattle and the Puget Sound. No exceptions.
Please do not waste your time and mine submitting if you cannot attend
these regular meetings.

Required skills:
We need someone very strong with Perl and OOP. We're a small team looking
for someone sufficiently senior; and as I'm sure you can understand,
vetting candidates is difficult. We recognize that many of your best code
samples may be proprietary, and there’s only so much we can learn from a
resume. So we have elected to test skills to give us a good idea of where
exactly you are and if you're likely going to be a good fit with our team.
As far as what we need to see: clear understanding of Perl idioms to write
higher-order, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented applications.
Viable candiates will have a track-record of self-motivation, high
attention to detail, and ability to work very independently. Everything
else falls under desired skills.

Desired skills:
Desired skills for the position include experience with: nginx, Apache,
MySQL admin and replication, Debian sysadmin and networking (IP, DNS,
etc.), Subversion, Trac, jQuery, XHTML/CSS, DBIx::Class, Template Toolkit.
