building productive development teams, and demonstrate an ability to
deliver in a fast-paced environment. You thrive on tackling difficult
problems; have great troubleshooting abilities and years of hands-on
software development skills. You keep abreast of the latest technology

strong leadership qualities and a track record of delivering great
solutions.
