Job title: Short Term Pearl Developer

Company name: Netcentric Computer Solutions

Location: UNITED STATES - Remote Work into NYC

Pay rate: US $$

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: UNTIL  COMPLETED

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a small pearl script running on a 2003 server.  It is functioning
properly.

I migrated to 2008 server IIS but it does not function.

Need script reviewed and tweaked on new server.


Script performs simple database lookups of an MS Access DB and renders to a
web based form. 

The application is in a law firm, it lists the plaintiff, the defendant and
the insurance carrier as well as the case number.

The purpose of the application is to allow a user to search by plaintiff,
defendant or carrier to determine the case number so they know where on the
server to put files.


Admin screen allows simple data entry - adding a new case involves
collecting the name of the  plaintiff, the defendant and the carrier - and
based on simple rules within MS ACcess, creating a folder on the server
with the newly generated CASE NUMBEr as the name of the folder.

I migrated to 2008 server IIS but it does not function.

Need script reviewed and tweaked on new server.

Remote work is fine.

Required skills:
RDP to windows environment
Pearl to MS Access connection
Pearl within MS Explorer using IIS
Windows explorer to create new folders
