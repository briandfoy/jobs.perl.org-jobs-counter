Job title: Sr. Perl Developer

Company name: Untitled

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: TBD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
THE COMPANY is seeking developers with strong previous experience
developing web and/or other applications in Perl. Come join our small but
growing team of developers and help improve and grow THE COMPANY's system
as a major contributor. You'll be joining at a time when everyone's able to
make a real difference.

We have some terrific technical challenges ahead, including large- scale
datasets, complex data feed parsing, auto-scaling components across virtual
servers, architecting a dynamic queueing system, populating a large data
warehouse reporting system, and more.

THE COMPANY is a venture-backed start up with real customers and real
revenue. Our office is located in downtown San Francisco. You'll work with
a small team of very smart people who'll talk about the latest tech stuff
one moment and obscure independent music and movies the next.

Required skills:
What we're looking for:

 

	 Experience developing significant software for at least 5 years;
you know about design patterns and anti-patterns, common algorithms, web
application system architecture, and good development practices.

	 Several years spent coding substantial applications in Perl. You
know all about Perl subroutines and objects, code re-use, how to debug and
profile apps, and how to make code efficient yet readable and maintainable.


	 You've spent a lot of time with CPAN and know a lot of the best
packages so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

	 You're perfectly at home in a Linux environment, and you might
even have reasonable experience as a sysadmin.

	 Experience working with SQL databases such as MySQL. You can do
multi-table joins in your head and know the difference between inner and
outer joins.

	 Experience in other languages like Java and C/C++.

	 Your previous team members know that you can take a project and
it'll be done when you said it would be. And not only that but you've
tested it inside and out already. The QA team really likes you.

	 You believe strongly in unit testing, good documentation, code
reviews, and working closely with other developers, who like working with
you for those reasons.

	 You've worked at startups before, and look forward to working at
another one even though things can be chaotic at times.

	 If you're into front-end web development, you might have
experience with Javascript, AJAX, DHTML, and CSS.
