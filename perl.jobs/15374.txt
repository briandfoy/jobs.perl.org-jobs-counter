Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Binary.com

Location: Cyberjaya, Malaysia

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Binary.com is an international binary options trading company with offices
in Malaysia, Malta and Japan. Cyberjaya, Malaysia is the center for our
global IT operations group which is staffed by talented IT professionals
drawn from technical centers around the world. 

Due to fast growth, we are
seeking to recruit experienced Perl developers to join our IT development,
and Quantitative Analysis team, based in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. We are
seeking individuals experienced with Perl technologies such as Moose,
AnyEvent, POE, Mojolicious, Plack/PSGI, and preferably with some
mathematics background.

Our company pays special attention to professional
recruitment, so as to ensure that we engage only the most talented
developers and engineers. Each candidate for employment is assessed using a
difficult technical exercise that ensures we onboard engineers offering
both extensive experience and a strong interest in the field. Our
recruitment tests are also designed to select IT professionals with
character traits that include sound judgment, teamwork, a strong work
ethic, motivation and a commitment to excellence in software development
and development operations.

At Binary.com, we offer our IT staff the best
possible working conditions to help them advance in their careers. This
means flexible working hours, a casual dress code, and the best equipment
available. We provide each of our engineers with a high-end MacBook laptop,
and use only the newest and best equipment in our production server
environment. We customised a purpose-built office, designed to provide our
engineers with a comfortable and productive work space.

We believe in
developing a company culture based on trust and camaraderie, a flat
hierarchy, open and transparent communication, integrity and honesty, an
entrepreneurial and fast-moving pace, and providing our employees with the
best possible environment and tools that the company can provide.

We are a
very successful company with global reach, founded in 1999, and growing
rapidly. Whereas in 2010 our website supported on average 15,000 options
transactions per day, today we routinely transact in over 1,000,000 per day
â€“ a 66-fold increase in just 5 years. Working in a fast-growing
organization requires us to develop robust systems, coupled with a
high-quality and well-architectured code, and a strong focus on security.

Our back-end technologies include Linux, Perl, Postgres, Redis, Chef,
nginx, and cloud providers such as AWS. Our software development philosophy
is based on the git forking model and a vigorous process of code review to
ensure only high quality code makes it into our codebase, good test
coverage, prioritizing refactoring of code to pay back technical debt,
attention to code architecture, simplicity and readability, rapid releases
(we release code every day), outsourcing of non-core functions to cloud
providers, and the adoption of latest technologies whenever possible. We
aim to comply with all 12 points of the Joel Test.

We provide our staff
with an impressive array of rewards that include health insurance, a
generous annual bonus program for top performers, exciting company trips
around Asia, and the opportunity to participate in a meritocracy where
talented professionals can assume positions of increasing responsibility.

We are a highly international organisation, with staff from over 15
different countries. A large percentage of our employees in Malaysia are
expats, from all over the world. We make relocation simple, arranging work
permits and dependent passes for spouses and children, flights, initial
accomodation in Cyberjaya, and other required assistance for overseas
candidates.

Relocation to Malaysia offers the unique advantages of living
in a multicultural yet English-speaking country, with a low cost of living,
excellent food, a warm climate, and a vibrant expat community.
