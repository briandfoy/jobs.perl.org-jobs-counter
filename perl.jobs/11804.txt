Job title: Perl Testing/Development

Company name: TEKsystems

Location: Sacramento, CA, United States

Pay rate: $30-$50/Hr USD

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 12+ Months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
General duties include triaging test cases, enhancing the TCL
infrastructure, and working with the development teams to isolate problems.
If there is a problem with the test case, they will need to make sure the
test case was created properly and that there are not any problems with the
actual infrastructure. They are testing software that runs their networking
equipment. All of the tests are written in TCL and the actual test
infrastructure is in TCL as well. This person doesn't have to have TCL
experience, but if they don't another scripting language such as Perl
should be one of their strengths. This person will not be the one
developing the test cases, but will be executing them and trying to
identify problems.

Required skills: Perl!

Desired skills: Tcl, test automation, networking, test triage
