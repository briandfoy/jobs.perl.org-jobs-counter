Job title: Software developer- graduate research assistant

Company name: Los Alamos National Laboratory

Location: Los Alamos, New Mexico

Pay rate: 56100 US$/year

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: At least 6 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Influenza Sequence Database at Los Alamos National Laboratory has an
opening for an enthusiastic graduate of computer science/computational
biology/bioinformatics, with strong computing skills and an interest in
scientific computing in an area involving analysis of genetic sequences.

The GRA will be responsible for the maintenance of a number of existing
software tools, developing new tools that operate in the current
environment, interacting with the databases, and participating in research
projects by creating data analysis scripts in close collaboration with the
PI.

The successful GRA will work directly with Dr Catherine Macken in the
Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group. Dr Macken is PI on the Influenza
Sequence Database, a database-backed website which serves tools for
influenza research. 

An enthusiastic intern, with substantial starting skills can benefit
enormously from the wide variety of activities involved in the ISD. This
position is a good way to take a year to work and learn while considering
enrolling in a graduate program towards a Ph.D degree. 

Los Alamos National Laboratory is located at high altitude in the foothills
of the Jemez Mountains. The region is physically very beautiful, with many
opportunities for outdoor activities; it enjoys abundant sunshine.  The
nearby city of Santa Fe is known for its cultural richness.

Required skills:
An applicant must have the following attributes: ability to work
independently; demonstrated ability to write clear, annotated, accessible
code; demonstrated ability to prepare relevant documentation; experience
with Unix/Linux; experience with postgreSQL or similar. 

The successful GRA should have an educational background that matches at
least one of the three skill sets described below, in order to make rapid
progress in at least one of three near-term projects. Longer-term, the
successful GRA will have opportunities to expand his/her skill sets through
working at the user-interface, algorithm and database levels. 

Preferred skill sets for near-term projects:
1.	strong perl and database experience along with some exposure to
BLAST and tree building using PhyML/RAxML (and an interest in evolutionary
analyses); 
2.	perl, systems experience (freebsd at the level of installing perl
modules and scientific applications) and enough sql to work on existing
queries; 
3.	Java and sequence alignment experience. 

Priority will be given to skill sets 1 and 2.

Desired skills:
If a candidate has strong computing skills but lacks experience in
bioinformatics software, such as BLAST and PhyML, then the PI will provide
basic training in these tools. An interest in biological applications of
computer science is very important, although previous experience with
biology is not necessary.
