Description:
Did you know that Amazon.com has hundreds of software engineers working on
some of the most interesting technical challenges on the planet?

Amazon.com, headquartered in beautiful Seattle, is looking for exceptional
software engineers to join its growing technology organization. Our
engineering team works on tough technical problems that engage and stretch
their brains. As an engineer here, you might build cutting edge product
recommendation algorithms, scale and optimize our world class supply chain
systems, or architect and build an end-to-end e-commerce platform that
companies like Target and Toys R Us use to run their online businesses.

You'll work with smart, experienced teammates on a small cross-functional
team. You'll join a scientific culture focused on achieving aggressive
goals. And, you'll work on creating a world-class customer experience for
the millions of people who use Amazon.com.

Your Talents:
We're interested in smart, tenacious, results-oriented people who write
code and build systems to solve real business problems. We want Senior
Software Developers with a deep proficiency in object oriented design and
development, experience building large-scale systems in C++ or Java on UNIX
or Linux, and algorithms expertise. A Computer Science or Math degree and
7+ years' experience is preferred.

Why Seattle?
It's a very livable, family-friendly city with so much to do on the
weekends! The climate is mild and there are mountains and water all around
you. You should see the view from our lunchroom! (By the way, we offer a
great relocation program to senior engineers.)

We'll be in New York City to Interview Software Developers in February

If you're interested in interviewing with our engineering team while we're
in New York City,
