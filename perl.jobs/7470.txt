Pay rate: $90k annual

Description:
We're looking for a lead developer to join a start-up creating a
community-based web site in its final stages before launch. You will be
working on-site in a creative design studio in Brooklyn, NY. The team will
consist of two web designers, a front-end HTML developer and you.

We will need your help in getting the site to launch in the near-term, but
you will also play a large role in the planning and development of the
second iteration of the site.

This is a full-time permanent position. You must be hard-working,
time-efficient, and good at collaborating within a creative team. Our
studio work style is casual, but we are serious about deadlines.

Current technologies we are using are mod_perl and HTML::Mason with Apache
and MySQL on Linux servers. Working knowledge of these technologies are a
pre-requisite. Expertise is a plus.

Must like bulldogs.


Required skills:
mod_perl, Perl, Mason, HTML, Apache, MySQL, Linux

Desired skills: same as above
