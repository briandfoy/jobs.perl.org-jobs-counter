Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Ticketmaster.com

Internal ID: INTL-8

Location:
United States, California, West Hollywood

Pay rate: Commensurate with Skills

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Regular Hire

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
OK, Here's the deal. We're looking for a perl "guru" who has extensive
experience in development for high-volume, high-transaction web situations.
We have monster peak loads, which are great challenges so if that peaks
your interest, no pun intended, AND you have the experience, drop me a
resume. Be sure to put "INT-8" in your subject line and send your resume to
techjobs@ticketmaster.com.

Now a little about our backend... We run the typical racks of linux pizza
boxes running apache, mod_perl, etc. with big-iron Solaris boxes running
Oracle. We're a big open-source place but pragmatic and use commercial apps
where appropriate (e.g., Oracle). We're a leading mod_perl house and are
also big fans of Template Toolkit (http://www.template-toolkit.com/). If
that all sounds great, and you have the experience, you know what to do.
BTW: We have a killer dev team so I'm sure you'd fit right in ;)

Below is the more "formal" job description ----
