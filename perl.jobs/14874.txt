•	Familiarity with Modern Perl frameworks and libraries
•	Understanding of modern web technologies and techniques
•	Excellent communication skills and ability to discuss technical

•	Ability to work well under pressure, while retaining focus and
composure 
•	Attention to detail and managing delivery to time scales
