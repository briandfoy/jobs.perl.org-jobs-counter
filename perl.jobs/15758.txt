Company name:
Centre collégial de développement de matériel didactique CCDMD

Location: Montréal, QC, Canada

Pay rate: To discuss; Canadian dollars

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
The Collegial Centre for Educational Materials Development (CCDMD) is an
organism managed by the Collège de Maisonneuve and produces printed,
digital and online materials for teaching staff and students throughout the
Québec college system. Its mandate is both to ensure that students in the
system have access to quality educational materials in both French and
English, and to contribute to the development of these materials at the
various stages of production.

For this particular project, we are looking
for a Perl developer who could work on the Mathematical Association of
America software WeBWorK. We have a fourfold mandate:

- To develop a
better search engine
- To complete the internationalisation of the software
- To develop a user registration interface
- To integrate adjustments to
the look and feel of the UI

In addition, developers will contribute back
their work to the WeBWorK GitHub codebase. At this point, we are looking
for estimates to decide on a budget before moving on to the formal
attribution of the contract.
