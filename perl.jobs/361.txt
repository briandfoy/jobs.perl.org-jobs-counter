Job title:
Perl/MySql/web designer for QSR e-cash and Internet ordering system

Company name: Q Card Corporation

Location: United States, TX, Dallas

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Few weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We have a fully functional pilot currently in place and need to enhance
existing code to add more functionality on the server side.  We also need
to change the user interface on the web site as well.  The site is not
public and can only be seen by authenticating to the server with an
authorized hardware token. You can also work with the engineers of my
partner company so there will be no detective story on what does what. 

Required skills:
Perl and the database is in MySql running on a red hat linux box.  

Desired skills:
It would be great to have web design skills as well, but we care more about
functionality than how pretty it looks.
