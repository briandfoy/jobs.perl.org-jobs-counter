Job title: Advanced Software Developer

Company name:
Genome Sequencing Center, Washington University, St. Louis

Location: United States, MO, St. Louis

Pay rate: commensurate with experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University School of Medicine is
seeking an experienced software developer to support a high-profile,
large-scale, DNA-sequencing lab.  The position will include working with
scientists to develop a wide variety of applications, from short, one-time
scripts to complex, object-oriented applications accessing relational
databases.


Required skills:
Applicant must be able to build high quality, scalable tools for data
management.  Solid design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis skills
are a must.  High-level skills in abstract software design, object-oriented
architecture, and relational data modeling are required to do the job.

The successful candidate will be able to learn new things on a regular
basis, think critically, work with a team of other skilled developers, and
produce solutions in a production environment quickly.

Proficiency in Perl or other dynamically-typed languages (Ruby, Python,
etc.) will be required to do the job effectively.  Strong skills with large
relational databases such as Oracle are a necessity.

Desired skills:
Experience designing graphical user interfaces is a plus.    Regular work
will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. 
Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software, and
programming in a network environment are also assets.
