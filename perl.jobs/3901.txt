Job title:
Perl Intra-Webpage/DBI Programmer for Statistical Process Control

Company name:
ESCO Integrated Manufacturing (Concord, CA)

Location: United States, CA, Concord

Pay rate: Negotiable (USD)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
ESCO is a manufacturing company dealing with high-precision machining.

This project involves:
- SPC (Statistical Process Control)
- a backend DBMS (MS Access), storing data from CMM (coordinate measuring
machine) dump - .txt extensions
- a frontend U/I
- a software by SAS (statistical package software) with scriptable language
based closely to C-programming
- hundreds of products and hence hundred thousands data points, ever
increasing and will need archiving.

What needs to be done is:
- the completion of existing data interface with .txt files of different
formats using VBA (or provide quick, simple and learnable alternative using
Perl)
- the completion of system to routinely upload data into the DBMS, with
archiving.
- the creation of a simple U/I with multiple menu options for different
product groups. This will allow user to select product and dimension(s) for
statistical analysis and report abridged data and graphs/charts
- the creation of intranet webpages that is part of the U/I with options to
expand to secured internet webpage(no encryption necessary)

We want to keep it simple, economical, fast, workable and minimal
maintenance. Our industry is very dynamic, so we will need the coding to be
simple and documented for future upgrades (which may be needed). Hence,
your coding cannot be proprietry.

Contract will have to be at our location to learn how the system is setup
and will need to work with our statistical software initially and during
testing phase. Due to security reasons, we cannot allow testing with
external connection outside our intranet.

Our expectation is that the contract will be completed in one month or
less. Compensation is per contract as initially agreed upon by both
parties, regardless of duration.

Required skills: Perl, SQL, VBA, MS Access.

Desired skills: Webpage Design.
