Job title:
Perl/Python/Ruby/PHP developers (several positions)

Company name: mySociety

Internal ID: msjob6

Location: United Kingdom, Home working position

Pay rate: £28-£50k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
How would you like to be a coder in an organisation that is as determined
to make a difference in the world as it is to be a truly high quality,
engineer-led software team?

mySociety is that organisation. We’re a project of a registered charity,
currently running award-winning civic and democratic websites like
TheyWorkForYou.com and FixMyStreet.com, and we’re looking to grow our
already-celebrated development team by several new members over the next
six months.

We’re looking for people with at least two years experience (professional
or keen amateur) in at least one of Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, C++,
Javascript or Adobe Flex, and who have ambitions to learn more languages in
the future.

We’re looking for developers willing to commit to full or mostly-full time
positions (no freelancers, sorry) and who are up for a career change that
will see them stay with us for a little while. You’ll get to work with
volunteers, mix commercial and charitable projects, and travel far and
wide. Plus, you can work from wherever you live (in the UK), and we pay
salaries from £28k to £50k depending on skills.

Most of all, we’re looking for coders who look at the services we have
built so far and think “I wish I’d been on that project”. Projects you’ll
likely be working on over the next few months include (but are not limited
to):

    * A/B testing and conversion tracking of our charitable sites
    * Commercial spinoffs from FixMyStreet
    * Mapumental
    * Enhancements to TheyWorkForYou and WhatDoTheyKnow
    * Commercial development for clients

We’re looking to speak with possible candidates continually over the next
few months, with a view to hiring two developers now and two more later in
the year. Please send us your CV if you’re interested – the address is
hello@mysociety.org and the subject line needs to be msjob6. The first
round closing date is 10am on Monday 21st February, but CVs received after
this deadline will still be considered for the next round of hiring.

Required skills:
at least two years experience (professional or keen amateur) in at least
one of Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, C++, Javascript or Adobe Flex
