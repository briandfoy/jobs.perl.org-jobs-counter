Hi,

We require some programming help in customising a shopping cart script 
(Merchant Order Form) that we intend to purchase, with respect to the 
shipping charge calculation and the checkout web page appearance. All the 
technical documentation about the script and how to customize it is 
available online at the script provider's web site. We estimate this is a 
simple job for experienced perl programmers which requires only a few hours 
of work.

Please let us know if you are interested. We look forward to hearing from 
you soon.


Yours sincerely
The Support Team @ SGBox
