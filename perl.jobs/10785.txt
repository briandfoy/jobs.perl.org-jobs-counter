Job title: eCommerce company seeks senior mod_perl developer

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: Negotiable p/h

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are a growing ecommerce site with a mature mod_perl application that has
grown in size and inefficiency over the past few years. 

We are looking for a senior mod_perl programmer to work with us on
optimizing and reorganising our application and possibly to help us port it
to apache2.

You should enjoy trimming every byte and millisecond you can from an
application.

An option will be available to make the work longer term if it is suitable
for both parties.

The project will be remote and hours to suit.

We are not looking for someone who can just write perl code, we are fine in
that department.

Please only apply if you are very experienced with mod_perl shared memory
management techniques and have used GTop extensively.

Please apply with your hourly rate and number of hours available per week.

Required skills:
mod_perl
apache 1.3
