Job title: QA Software Engineer UI 

Company name: Riverbed Technology

Internal ID: 2047

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco or Sunnyvale

Pay rate: Open 

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Full Time

Hours: Full time

Description:
Like analyzing and breaking complex systems?
Excited by virtualization and networking?
Want to deliver a superior user experience?
Ready to work on something big?

We’ve got the job for you.

You’ll be working on serious software that 60 of the 100 biggest global
companies put in the core of their networks.  You’ll be surrounded by
experts in the field, but be empowered to forge your own path.	You’ll have
the right tools – from a hands-off, fully-automated lab with a few thousand
machines at your disposal, to a test code library built so that you
concentrate on your test logic, not the trivial stuff.	We understand that
you need just enough of the right processes, so you’ll take part in code
reviews and use proven documentation and progress tracking standards that
help us build and test rock-solid products.  And most importantly, you’ll
have new challenges at every turn.

We’re a fun group that feels more “Web 2.0” than “Big Company.”  We rock
out on the game room Guitar Hero, hold Friday night keggers, and we even
have the occasional something we call “Mustache Mondays” (fake mustaches
provided).  You can run Mac OS, Windows, or Linux with double monitors and
your favorite ergo keyboard – we don’t care, as long as it fits your style.
 It’s not surprising that we were voted one of the 2010 best places to work
in the San Francisco Bay Area by the SF Business Times.
