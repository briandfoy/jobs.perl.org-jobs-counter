Job title: Perl/Linux/Web Software Developer

Company name: TAG Online, Inc.

Location: United States, NJ, Upper Montclair

Pay rate:
Compensation dependent on experience and qualifications within a range of
$40K to $70K. Relocation expenses not covered.

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Description:
Technical professional in an established yet expanding Internet business.

Successful candidates will be involved in the full cycle of development of
custom and customized web applications for TAG Online's clients. The
majority of our development involves a combination of Perl (typically with
mod_perl), Javascript, and SQL on Linux or Solaris platforms. This work is
done in small teams, and involves direct contact with customers for initial
analysis and delivery of releases.

participate in the management of the networks and systems within.

As a small company, members of our staff all wear multiple hats. Of key
import is the ability to communicate well, both with clients and coworkers.


Clients occasionally need help with potentially obscure problems that their
local ISPs can not or will not handle. This can involve some in-depth
digging through log files, testing of local and distant networks and
various other forms of research as a part of the process, and the ability
to solve these puzzles is important to the job. A love of puzzles is a
definite plus.

If you've a passion for detailed and high quality work that is an
expression of yourself, this is an excellent opportunity. We're a great
company and we are looking for people to become part of our team. 

Required skills:
    *  Minimum of 4 years of schooling in a computer-related field, or the
professional equivalent
    * Solid knowledge of the Internet and the World Wide Web
    * Strong background in UNIX (Linux and/or Solaris)
    * Some comfort level in Microsoft environments
    * Experience working as a part of a development team
    * Experience trouble-shooting
    * Familiarity with:
	  - Apache (mod_perl would be very helpful)
	  - OO Methods
	  - Some non-empty subset of Java, C++, C 
    * Ability to program in:
	  - HTML
	  - Perl
	  - SQL
	  - Javascript (using AJAX) 
    * Ability to operate as both a self-starter and team player
    * Good people and communication skills
    * Eagerness to learn and a love of technology
