Job title:
Perl Developer and some Systems Administration tasks

Company name: RS Hughes Co - Salt Lake City, UT

Location: Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

Pay rate: Competitive with industry

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Seeking motivated Software Engineer, with a Computer Science degree, and
5-10 years experience developing automated back-end processes in Perl or
Bash, and in some cases building internal company web pages that let
company departments self-serve recurring needs. Longer term this person
would become a key part of our development team and would play important
roles in major development projects going forward.

R.S. Hughes Co is the
largest 3M products distributor in the US and Mexico, with over 50 stocking
warehouses. We offer companies the best services in the industry for their
factory floor supplies, allowing customers to purchase by web, mobile app,
phone, over the counter, or automatically using one of our proprietary web
Purchasing and Supply Solutions. We are a strong stable growing company
(60+ years) with a nimble technical team, located in the heart of ski
country. It is said we are a bit laid back, but no, you can't bring your
dog to work, cut your hair in the lunch room, or show up in a T-Shirt. You
can wear those on weekends.

Speaking of weekends, we don't work on those.
Four-year computer science degree required. Full benefits, and you get to
work with other great people.

Opening is for full-time, on-site work, in
Salt Lake City, Utah. This is not a remote or part-time position. Send
resume and a script, github or website you have created. A cogent cover
email would be appreciated.

Desired skills:
We have automated system/order processing operations, periodic processes,
and repetitive tasks that we want someone to evaluate and then automate or
improve so our company can be more efficient. Our back-end is Perl MySQL
Solr Linux Apache. Ideal candidate will have...

- 5-10 Years programming
experience developing Perl Bash MySQL scripts
- Systems administration
experience- Project design experience
- Ariba XML AWS JSON
- Perl Linux
CentOs Apache Progress Solr GIT
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Jquery UI,
Google Charts
- JIRA Bitbucket Agile Confluence

Candidate with strong
MySQL query knowledge is a plus.

We are not expecting a 9 out of 10 with
these, but we use them all, and they should provide a feel for our
development environment. We prefer open source solutions when possible,
whatever is best, most efficient. We have aggressive development plans and
we are looking for someone that has experience, can contribute to the
discussion, but also knows how to buckle down and execute. Knowledge of
robust automated script development is most important.
