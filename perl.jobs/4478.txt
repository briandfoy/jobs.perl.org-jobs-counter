Job title: Perl Software Engineer

Company name: Parus Interactive

Location: United States, IL, Bannockburn

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you love Perl and pool, you're reading the right post (if you like ping
pong, we've got that too).
 
We are offering an opportunity to work on diverse projects with exciting
technology in a dynamic and open environment.  Your primary role will be
building interactive speech applications in Perl (yes, you read that right)
using our XML-based dialog description markup language and Perl-based
application framework.	Other tasks include building automated tests for
speech applications (command line based), developing data exchange
processes with third parties and miscellaneous pieces of Web development. 
The amount of Perl experience you have is not as important as intellegence
and a good attitude; we are always learning and sharing new things.

Our HR department made us add this:

Parus Interactive is seeking a motivated and creative professional to
design and develop robust, natural speech driven IVR applications to meet
specific customer requirements. Parus Interactive is an excellent
environment for engineers to learn new technologies and work on some of the
communication and software industry’s cutting edge technology.	In this
environment the Engineer will be given responsibility to provide efficient
solutions while being part of a professional team of experts in these
fields.  You will work with the best and learn from the best.


Required skills:
- OO Perl experience (but we want to hear from Python or PHP people too)
- Good understanding of algorithms and data structures
- SQL (Sybase is a plus)
- Ability to work independently on the entire lifecycle of a software
project

Desired skills:
- HTML, Javascript, AJAX, mod_perl
- any experience with speech recognition or GSL grammars is a huge plus
