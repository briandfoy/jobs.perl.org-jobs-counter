conceptual database in first-normal-form in their head and knows the
importance of foreign and unique keys).

We’ve also got several Ruby on Rails projects in the works, so Ruby and/or
Rails experience will earn you points.

Our telecommute recipe is Skype, GitHub, Pivotal Tracker, Travis CI. At a
basic level, we want you present for our daily 20 minute scrum meet over
Skype and either daily or near-daily commits (or appropriately, asking
questions over Skype to climb over blocking issues).

Required skills:
- Object-oriented Perl
- Version control, Git
- Relational databases, MySQL
- Familiarity with Mojolicious or other MVCish development frameworks
- Located somewhere in the world between GMT to GMT+6 (the rest of the Perl
team is in GMT+2)

- Familiarity with ElasticSearch
- Extra strong database skills
- Skype, GitHub, Pivotal Tracker, Travis CI
