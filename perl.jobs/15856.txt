Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Pobox

Location: Philadelphia, PA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
First off: know that you can see the way better-looking and more-link-rich
version of this posting at https://www.pobox.com/jobs

But here's the deal:

We're looking for a Perl developer to join the FastMail team in our
Philadelphia office. Come work on the original social media platform -
email - at a place that strives to put the customer's needs first.

Together with our other engineers, you'll work on Pobox, Listbox, our
about-to-launch new service, Topicbox, and their associated systems.
(FastMail is our parent company, but not the code base you'll primarily be
working on.)

This is a senior developer role. Expect to plan, make design
decisions, and offer feedback and code review as a group - but be
comfortable implementing solo. Everyone handles a mix of small tasks and
larger projects - you will push code to production in your first week.

We
have been simplifying and consolidating code for years, but our production
code base spans 15 years - and you'll be working on it! Expect plenty of
refactoring and converting in-place code to reusable methods. Plan on a
50/50 mix of new development and improving old code.

You may be a fit for
this role if you:

* Have strong Perl skills. This is the main language
that implements almost all of our server-side logic. A good programmer's
abilities span languages, but you'll need to be (or quickly become) up to
speed in modern Perl.

* Score "lines of code deleted" as high or higher
than "lines written". Hearing "refactor" sparks joy in your heart. The
first time you saw NYTProf, you thought of three pieces of code you were
dying to run it on.

* Have always enjoyed untangling a ball of yarn, or
look at code and think "I know there's a better way" - and want to dive in
and do it.

* Seek balance between struggle and flow. There's value to
figuring things out, but we also don't want you to waste your own time. You
can identify when you're stuck, and feel comfortable asking team mates for
another set of eyes.

Desired skills:
Problems you might work on early on:

* improving code deployment across
staging and production
* replacing our internal job queueing system
*
moving older code (on perl 5.8) to the new environment (perl 5.24! yay!)
*
finishing an overhaul of our email signing system (DKIM)
* making a first
pass at new, unoptimized server code to shave off the first 90% of its
runtime

Here's an unordered list of some of the things you'd be working
with. We hope you're skilled in some of them; no one (except our staff)
could already know them all.
