Job title: Perl developer for pure-Perl company

Company name: BookTrolls LLC

Location: Houston, TX

Pay rate: $100K/yr

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
BookTrolls is looking to hire top-notch developers to help fuel our rapid
expansion. Our entire software infrastructure is pure Perl, under Linux.
This will not just be a software integration/automation position. We use
Perl to write enterprise-class TCP/IP servers and back-end applications
that run the entire company. We write software for a wide range of business
applications for internal users; and both our culture and our development
model are pretty informal. Hours are flexible. Leadership opportunities are
available, as we're doubling in size every two years and expanding
internationally. Our software team is small, fast, and flexible; and we
offer a greater degree of creative control, project ownership, and career
growth than you'll find at most any other company. Plus, you can ride the
forklift. This position is ideal for an ambitious, energetic self-starter
with a mastery of Perl.

We offer a 401(k) with 100% match of up to 4% of salary, with immediate
vesting, plus medical and dental. Telecommuting is not an option for this
position, but we do offer relocation assistance to Houston and visa
sponsorship.

About Our Company

We are one of the largest independent booksellers on the Amazon and eBay
marketplaces, among other online marketplaces. Located in Houston, we sell
purely online and ship from our Houston warehouse. We started in a garage
in 2007 and have since expanded to 75,000 sq ft and over 100 employees,
doubling sales and inventory roughly every 2 years. Our main competitive
advantage is our in-house software, which runs every aspect of our business
and possesses capabilities unseen in our industry. Most of our competitors
run their companies off shrink-wrapped 3rd-party vendor software (and it
shows.) We are not a software company, but software is at the core of what
we do.

Please note that our main website (booktrolls.com) does not reflect the
primary business model that this position will support.

Required skills:
- 5 years' experience with Perl, preferably more than just "glue" scripts;
must be thoroughly fluent
- Fluent in object-oriented Perl and solid OO design principles
- Familiarity with Perl Apache CGI scripts
- Linux command line skills, including file manipulation, file editors,
grep, etc
- Excellent code documentation skills

Desired skills:
- Multi-threading experience, including deadlocks, race conditions, and
apartment threads
- Familiarity with BerkeleyDB, HTML, JavaScript, client/server programming,
and system-level Linux skills
