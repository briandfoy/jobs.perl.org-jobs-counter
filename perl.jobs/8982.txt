Job title: UNIX Developer/Administrator

Company name: Gabzip, Inc.

Location: United States, NY, Oswego

Pay rate: 75K USD starting

Travel: 50-75%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Seeking a seasoned UNIX developer/administrator to establish and maintain a
technology infrastructure from the ground up in a startup environment. 
Ideally, you know linux inside and out, are comfortable coding where
necessary, and have significant experience and ambition..

Ideally, you have the desire to take the lead role in defining technology
infrastructure from the start.	We expect that your level of expertise
provides you the ability to perform routine tasks easily.  Having said
that, a big part of being a good technologist is knowing when to stick with
old standards and when it makes sense to learn something new and apply that
knowledge.  We're looking for someone with that desire.  We encourage
entrepreneurial thinking.  In this position, you'll be setting the tone for
other technologists as we build out a team; it's important to us that new
additions and senior engineers follow the path you've created for them. 
This is a tremendous opportunity for growth.  In this position, you will
have a rare opportunity to grow into a management-type (hint: greater
responsibility and impact) role while maintaining your hands-on autonomy. 
We're in the business of execution, not micro-management.  Our company
doesn't have layers of middle management, but we do know what we want to
accomplish.  In fact, we want you to help us define how we're going to
accomplish our goals.  

This is a great opportunity based in Central New York.	This is newly
funded startup environment, so you'll have the opportunity to set things up
the right way, right away.  Extremely competitive and flexible
compensation, and a merit-based structure that rewards competence and
dedication.  We'll have informal reviews, frequently.  The pace will be
fast, but you'll never be bored, and you'll always be listened to.  We're
starting with a very small team, and will build up from there as we grow. 
We're well funded, so don't confuse "startup" with a lack of job security. 
If you're up to the challenge, please forward your resume.  The specifics
of the job will be explained if you qualify for an interview.


Required skills:
-Linux server distros (i.e. CentOS)
-OpenVZ/Virtuozzo virtualization
-Working with leased servers
-PostgreSQL administration (a bit of a specialty, or serious
interest/experience a major plus)
-Apache/mod_perl
-Perl (an interest in doing some Object-Oriented development is a major
plus)
-DNS, iptables, Subversion, even GNU screen, and other tools of best
practice
-Having a firm idea of what "best practice" is, and how you would define
it.
-Method-flexible solutions to scalability
-Experience with open source software and diverse exposure to open
technologies

Desired skills:
-Self motivated problem solver
-Loves a challenge, enjoys solving a complex problem, loves finding the
right creative solution
-Knows how to lead and how to help motivate others, and make problems more
manageable for them
-A good balance of creativity and a desire to be organized
-Optimistic about the bleeding edge, but has practical methodologies; You
know what's stable, and you know when it's worth a new approach.
-Confidence that no matter the size of the problem, you can conquer it by
breaking it into manageable components
-You don't need us to tell you what's important; you will form your own
strategy, and we'll work with you to make it happen.
