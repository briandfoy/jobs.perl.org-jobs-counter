Job title: Senior Software Engineer Telecommute Opportunity

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for a talented and experienced Senior
Software Engineer to join our team. We help protect thousands of companies
worldwide from fraud, screening over a billion online transactions each
year, and we provide IP intelligence data to thousands more. This work
requires us to tackle formidable challenges and we want your help!


THE
POSITION OVERVIEW

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will contribute to
development projects both big and small, including but not limited to:

-
Evolving, updating, and maintaining our extensive suite of client APIs and
our tools for working with MaxMind databases
- Adding features to existing
products, refactoring legacy code, fixing bugs, or developing entirely new
services 
- Being proficient and having experience in multiple languages,
and suggesting good technical design decisions 
- Writing tests and
documentation, developing highly performant and optimized code, and
communicating well with non-developers

The right candidate will have
experience in both dynamic and static programming languages to help us
develop and improve our products, and will be willing to bring new ideas to
the table.


OUR DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES

Our backend code is largely written
in Perl and Go using PostgreSQL and Linux, and we provide client APIs and
database tools for .NET (C#), C, Java, Perl, PHP, and Python.  The person
in this role will also be responsible for a critical and highly performant
solution written in C. We maintain high standards for our development
practices including continuous integration, using TeamCity to run our full
test suite for all changes. All work goes through internal code review on
GitHub Enterprise.

We use free software as much as possible, and we
release code back to the community when we can do so. We're trying to
improve the way we do development, and we want you to participate in that
process.

Our development team is largely comprised of telecommuters, so
communication centers around Google Hangouts, group chat, and agile
planning tools. We invite candidates to apply from any US state except NJ,
NY, TX, and WA (for regulatory reasons) and from anywhere in Canada.
Candidates open to relocating will be considered. Full-time telecommuting
is permitted.


WORKING AT MAXMIND

MaxMind is a casual, friendly,
results-focused company of nearly 40 employees, about half of whom are in
technical positions. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but
weâ€™re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding
about appointments and life events.

Compensation includes a competitive
salary and participation in a company performance-based bonus plan.
Software engineers get a $2k professional development budget and five days
for professional development annually.

In addition to medical, dental, and
vision coverage, we offer several other benefits in the US, including a
401k with employer contribution, FSA, and transit reimbursement. Please
inquire about benefits in Canada.

Our office is located near downtown
Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, a five minute walk from the nearest
commuter rail line and several express bus lines.

Desired skills:
Minimum Qualifications:
- Experience with dynamic languages, especially
Perl.  We use Perl but we're happy to hear from JavaScript, PHP, Python,
and Ruby developers as well. (A programming exercise will be given to all
applicants.)

- Experience with static languages such as C#, Java, C, or Go
 

- An interest in picking up new languages

- Experience developing for
deployment on a Linux or BSD platform

- Experience writing tests and
documentation

- Experience doing code reviews

- Excellent written and
spoken communication skills

- The ability to work with a geographically
dispersed team


HIGHLY DESIRED: 
- Web development, especially RESTful web
services

- Experience with building and improving code for high
performance

- Experience with manual memory management

- FS/OSS
contributions. Tell us about them!
