Job title:
Entry level Perl/FreeBSD admin for internet startup

Company name: PropertyShark.com

Location: United States, NY, Brooklyn

Pay rate: $16/hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is a good starting point for a smart, hard working, self starter. 
You'll be joining a 30 person technology team in a fast-growing internet
startup company.

Our basic requirement is to have someone who can go over to our data center
in Manhattan and work on the machines.	We have a full system
administration staff, but they are offsite.  So you'll be the one who
physically touches the machines.  We have a full rack of Linux and FreeBSD
machines.  Big machines -- five 8 core web servers, large RAID arrays,
terabytes upon terabytes of storage.  You'll be in charge of reinstalling
operating systems, replacing parts, pulling hard drives, and so on.

But after you get everything straightened out, that will be just 1-2 days
per week.  The rest of the time you'll be a programmer working on our web
site.  It'll probably be fixing whatever is broken and responding to other
emergencies.

Our web site is pretty big and complex.  The codebase is several megabytes
(after compressing with gzip!!!).  If you're motivated and learn quickly
you'll be able to take on more complicated programming projects.

Required skills:
Knowledge of Perl, desire to learn more
Linux or FreeBSD
