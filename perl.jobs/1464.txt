Job title: Perl CGI/Database Support Tech/Developer

Company name: bbNetwork Ltd

Pay rate: Negotiable. Payment in GBP.

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Our company provides customers with a Perl CGI based message board
software. We are looking for talented Perl programmers to help out with
tech support and development.

Your duties will include:

- Performing installations of our product, on various servers. In some
cases, a working knowledge of cross-server perl (and perl modules) will be
needed.
- Some direct programming, mainly with bug fixes and customer requests.
- Assisting customers with their queries via e-mail and our support forums.

- Assisting customers via LivePerson (text chat).

You will be compensated with a base monthly rate (negotiable, and will be
agreed upon before work begins, although the base rate is expected to be in
the area of several hundred GBP), plus bonuses for each completed customer
query/request. When working in the live chat, you will be given bonuses
calculated per 10 minutes of chat time with a customer. All these rates are
negotiable. If you have a specific range in mind, please include it with
your resume and details. You will be compensated in GBP.

Hours are flexible. At present, you will be working alone or with one or
two others. Bonuses will be given for quick replies and resolutions, so the
more time you have online, the better. You will be expected to take a
regular interest in the text chat - the more you are online, the more
customers can access, and the more compensation you receive.

Required skills:
- This position requires an excellent understanding of Perl and CGI
programming. Knowledge of (or willingness to learn) different database
systems (such as mysql, postgres, ODBC etc) is also required.

- Experience with Perl, CGI and DBI is a must. A lot of customer queries
are technical, and will require your Perl knowledge to fix/answer.

- HTML and (some) javascript knowledge.

- The ability to remain friendly, polite and helpful to customers at all
times.

- The ability to make your answers understandable to both the expert and
the novice. Our customers range right across the scale in terms of their
experience and knowledge.

- The ability to find your way around various different platforms,
including variations of linux, Windows, Unix, etc. Your own day-to-day OS
doesn't matter.

Desired skills:
Past experience with message boards and message board software is a big
plus. Experience with web design is also good.

Contact information:
If you'd like to be considered for this position, please send:

- your resume (.doc, .pdf, .rtf or .txt preferred)
- details of your past experience with Perl, and any past experience you
have with message board software.
- a short note on why you think we should choose you for the position,
above anyone else. This only needs to be a few lines or so.

by e-mail to: hr@bbboy.net . Each application will receive a thorough
consideration, so apologies now that it might take a while to reply to
everyone.

We're happy to answer any questions you have about the position, at
hr@bbboy.net .
