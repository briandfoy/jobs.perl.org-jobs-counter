Job title: LAMP Developer

Company name: Clickmagick

Location: Austin, TX

Pay rate: negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
1,000s of paying customers rely on ClickMagick to track, manage and
optimize all of their online advertising.

We are looking to add a fourth
technical member to our team. Everybody telecommutes and it is a relaxed
environment.

We offer a competitive starting salary, equity, the freedom
to work when and where you want, no corporate BS or politics, and a great
team on a mission. 

Starting salary negotiable depending on skills and
experience.

Our stack is Perl + CentOS + Apache + Nginx + MySQL + jquery +
Angular V1 + vagrant + docker + Git. You don't need to know all of them,
but the more you know, the better. You must have Perl experience. We have
many tens of thousands of lines of Perl code for you to feast upon.

The
main services we use are  Github + Trello + Travis CI + Slack + CloudFront.
Experience with some of these is a big plus.

Desired skills:
We are looking for somebody that is very comfortable with Perl and willing
to use the lateness hotness in new code while maintaining legacy code. We
have older code using mod_perl on Apache and newer code using Plack+nginx
and OpenResty with some Lua. Familiarity with nginx or Plack is a big plus.

Being a CPAN author is also a big plus.

Knowing multiple languages, even
ones we don't use, is a huge plus.

Basic jQuery/front-end JS skills
required, strong jQuery skills is a big plus, as well as HTML5/CSS and
knowing how the DOM works. If you know about Angular or Docker, that is a
plus, but not required.

We use vagrant for local testing and experience
with that is a plus.

MySQL
CentOS experience is a plus, not required as
long as you are very comfortable on the command-line.
