After 5 years providing high-end TWiki support at Yahoo!, a reorg =
dropped me into the wrong team. The VP didn't understand what I did and =
now I'm looking for a new job.

My passion is to help others to be more productive. My focus is more on =
solving a problem, not writing a program (although I often write =
programs to solve problems).=20

For the past 5 years, I've been answering questions, troubleshooting =
problems, and developing TWiki apps. I wasn't a TWiki expert when I =
joined Yahoo! (although I was a TWIki users) but I became an expert to =
meet the need.=20

One co-worker told me:
 "I really don't think TWiki is your thing -=97 it's something you're =
good at,=20
  but not your most valuable quality.  Nor is programming.

  You solve problems in a way that meets peoples' needs, and work with =
them to=20
  provide tools that enable them to do their work well."

Another said:
"Vicki is THE go-to person ... for all things TWiki. But her most =
important=20
 contribution is sometimes missed...she's an excellent information =
architect.=20
 She always asks 'what are you trying to accomplish? Who is this for?' =
This=20
 inquiry leads to data tailored to the purpose and audience."


My skills and interests lie in the areas of:

* Problem solving and troubleshooting.

* Information architecture and content management.

* Scripting languages (mostly Perl, but also Awk, Make, Shell, TWiki, =
etc.).
 I'm reading up on Ruby; it's not all that different from Perl.

* Technical writing and editing (eg, copy editing, formatting, =
organizing,=20
 proofreading, word-smithing).

* Web weaving (eg, CSS, HTML, JavaScript).

* Scientific programming, data filters, knowledge management, and social =
media.

* Code review, code cleanup, and bug hunting.

* Writing how-tos and tutorials, organizing documentation, and training.

I prefer to work directly for the person or team who needs my services, =
i.e. developing internal tools vs marketed applications, creating =
internal documentation vs external publications, etc. I would rather be =
the sole (or one of a few) programmer supporting a non-programming team, =
than one of many people working on a large application.

If you know of a company that could use someone like me, please let me =
know!
