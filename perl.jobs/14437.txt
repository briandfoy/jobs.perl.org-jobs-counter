Job title:
Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Elite Financial Technology Company

Location: Mountain View, CA, United States

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
In the years following the financial crash of 2008, a team of engineers
founded a finance tech company with a formidable mission: How to disrupt,
modernize, and overhaul the worldwide wealth management industry?

The answer? - An elite team of tightly knit professionals. At our client’s
company, we're looking to create a product and brand that inspires people
and aligns incentives in one of the world’s most important and influential
industries.

We’re looking for an engineer obsessed with automation; a talented
programmer that’s excited about infrastructure; and an experienced
architect that can both map out our future and get their hands dirty making
it a reality. Join us during this crucial period of growth, and play a key
role in designing and building the technical infrastructure of a company
that aims to become the bedrock of global finance.

What will be your responsibilities as an Infrastructure Engineer?
You are, first and foremost, an engineer: we’re looking for a developer,
not a system administrator. You also appreciate that code doesn’t live in
an isolated system: experience has taught you to build with infrastructure
in mind. You enjoy making long-term decisions about which technologies the
company should pursue.

Responsibilities
• Architecting a scalable infrastructure (ex: auto-scaling for the
production environment)
• Building tools to help automate system administration (ex: an automated
SSH access provisioning system)
• Improving the build and CI pipeline (ex: rolling releases)
• Advocating for and implement industry best-practices (ex: a centralized
logging infrastructure)
• Working with developers across the org to ensure projects are built with
infrastructure in mind

Required skills:
Requirements
• 5+ years experience as a software engineer
• Demonstrable experience working with distributed systems
• Experience with at least one OO language (Java, C++)
• Experience with at least one scripting language (Perl, Python)
• Working experience with web frameworks
• Working experience with database systems
• Familiarity with Linux administration
• Familiarity with build and continuous integration systems a plus 

Why work here?
• Help invent the tools to run the $1 trillion global finance industry
• Equity stake, very attractive salary, and comprehensive benefits
• Top-caliber coworkers, elite clients, and work environment
• Fringe benefits: catered meals; high-profile guest lecturers, and
intramural office sports
