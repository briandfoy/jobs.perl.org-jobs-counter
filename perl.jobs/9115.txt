Job title:
R&D Programmer (Catalyst, Email, Moose "o")

Company name: Pobox.com

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're looking for a new programmer. You might know us as Pobox.com or
Listbox.com; we've been around since before the Internet was cool, offering
all
kinds of email-related services. Email is our life's blood, so you'll need
to
know email, but we also do a lot of work with web applications and web
services, automated testing, job queueing, and whatever other problems crop
up
along the way.

We're a small company located in center city Philadelphia. You'll need to
live
nearby and come into the office a couple times a week -- but it's a pretty
comfortable and casual office, so don't panic.

We like open source; it runs our business. As much as possible, we try to
write
our code so that we can release it -- it's easier to write good code when
you
know other people will see it.

Feel free to sign up for a trial account of either service to see more
about
what we do.
