[Setting:  Perl Programmers Anonymous meeting]

Hi,

I'm Mike, and I'm a Perl programmer.

[response from audience: "Hi, Mike"]

I have tried to like C.  I even worked in Java for a while.
No matter what I tried, I couldn't help it.  It was like all I
could think about was getting a job where all I did was Perl.

[sympathetic nods]

I was employed as an SAP consultant, doing 4GL work for companies
like DuPont and Owens-Corning.  At first it was interesting enough,
but pretty soon I knew that I just coulnd't keep living the lie.
I was a Perl programmer, I knew it, and it was just impossible
to hide.

I introduced Perl and MySQL to the company and built an internal tool
to track their consultants, saving them a hundred thousand dollars
on some system that they were considering purchasing.  Even when the
job wasn't supposed to be a Perl job, it became one when I got there.

[knowing looks and sighs]

Then came OO Perl.  First it was just a little here and there,
extending a module or two with a couple of extra methods.
Then before I knew it I was doing everything with h2xs, making
my stuff installable with "perl Makefile.PL && make && make install",
using autoload rampantly and getting really rabid about ensuring
inheritability.  I couldn't stop myself!  All I wanted to do was
push it to the next level.

[mutters of "boy, have I been there!"]

Please help me feed my addiction!

[wild applause]
