Job title:
mod_perl/Mason/DBI Programmer (telecommute)

Company name: PropertyShark.com

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
PropertyShark.com is adding a programmer to meet its rapidly growing
business needs.  PropertyShark.com is New York City's premier property
research service, and we're adding new cities all the time.  New York
Magazine named us "New York's Best Real-Estate Resource" for 2005!

The core website is based on mod_perl/HTML::Mason with MySQL and
otherbacking databases.  Other business capabilities include webservice and
mapping technologies.

We're also using a lot of cool technologies, such as AJAX to supercharge
our user interface and our in-house mapping systems to generate the most
information-rich maps of New York City that you can find anywhere.

We think this opportunity is the most interesting and challenging Perl job
on the market.	Your existing skills will be pushed to the limit, and you
will have an opportunity to acquire and master a variety of new skills.

PropertyShark.com pays a fair and reasonable salary.  If it's all about the
money for you, look elsewhere.	If you're expecting a high salary for which
you can phone in a half-hearted effort, move on.  However, if you're a Perl
rock star who thrives on challenge and opportunity, this is the job for
you.

To apply, send your resume/CV to david@propertyresearchpartners.com.
Preferred formats are PDF and plain text.  (Resumes in POD will fill us
with a sense of awe and concern, but these will not receive any extra
consideration.)  Qualified candidates will be asked to complete a short
programming exercise for which there will be no compensation.  (Any
additional programming in the hiring process will be compensated.)

The hiring process will be extensive and last more than a week.  We want to
be certain that you are the right person for PropertyShark.com and that
this opportunity is the right challenge for you.

Principals only, without exception.  Every email from principals will be
acknowledged.  Emails from recruiters, contract shops, and other
non-principals will be deleted without response.

Note: USA residency is not required for this position.	However, a certain
level of familiarity and understanding of the American real-estate economy
is a bona fide occupational requirement for this position.  Most
native-born Americans possess sufficient understanding, as do many others. 
There won't be a test, but if you don't know what mortgages are and how
they work in the United States, you probably won't be successful in this
position.

PropertyShark.com is an equal-opportunity employer in every regard.  All we
care about is whether someone is smart and can get things done.


Required skills:
Strong Perl programming skills
HTML::Mason or equivalent templating system, such as Template::Toolkit
DBI experience with MySQL or other DBMS
ability to work independently and to communicate effectively about goals
and results 

Desired skills:
mod_perl expertise
FreeBSD system administration
SVN/CVS experience
Javascript/AJAX
