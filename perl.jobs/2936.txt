Description:
I have worked with this hiring manager for the past 6 years and have had
success in each organization he has been a part of.  If you're the right
match, I WILL get you results.

This company has been in business for nearly 10 years and in the last 8

The position will be responsible for developing applications supporting the
this client's Business Intelligence distributed data warehouse environment,
and will be involved in all phases of the software development life cycle:
analysis, design, development, validation and production support. We are
looking for a creative thinker with strong database development skills and
experience dealing with high volume data processing and analytics using
distributed systems.


Required skills:
* Strong Perl, C/C++, bash and Unix skills.
* Experience developing against very large relational databases, and
dealing with extremely large data sets. 


Desired skills:
* Experience developing and operating data warehousing / ETL applications
with Oracle, data modeling and design/architecture for OLAP environments.
