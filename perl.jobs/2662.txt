Company name: ReThink Recruitment Solutions

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £35-40,000

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Based in Central London, a leading B2B Internet company is looking for an
accomplished Perl Search Systems Engineer to take responsibility for the
development and deployment of business critical solutions into its
partners.  Working through all aspects of the deployment process from
establishing the product framework and defining technical requirements
through to build, implementation and ultimately post implementation
support.    You will be required to work within a highly skilled technical
team although you will also have contact with internal and external groups
within business development, product management and account management. 
Based within the European headquarters you will work across a network of 13
European countries and so travel within Europe (and also the US) is
required.  

Required skills:
This technically demanding positions requires strong Perl programming
skills (including OO) and ideally experience within C and Java.  You will
have experience of deploying applications on Unix (ideally Solaris and
Linux) and will have knowledge of relationship database technology.  

Desired skills:
Fluency in a second European language is ideal but not essential.
