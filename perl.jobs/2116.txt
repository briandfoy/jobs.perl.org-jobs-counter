Location: Canada, BC, Vancouver

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
You like to work with heterogenous systems (from cutting edge to oddball),
get your kicks from a smoothly running build farm, and	obsessively
automate everything.  You like keeping machines humming, enjoy the
challenges of heterogeneous networks, and collect 
idiosyncratic bits of knowledge about operating systems as a hobby. Along
with solid technical skills, you possess the ability to work as comfortably
and effectively as a team member as you do working alone, eager to help and
to learn.


Required skills:
<li>Solid build engineering experience (build systems, makefiles, etc) 
<li>Unix shell and Perl scripting experience 
<li>Solid experience with SCM tools and environments (prefer Perforce)
<li>Experience with Solaris, Linux, Windows
