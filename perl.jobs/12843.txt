Job title: Sysadmin / devops / BOFH

Company name: theregister.co.uk

Location: Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.

Pay rate: depends on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Register, the leading UK website for IT pros, is looking for a
full-time junior or mid-level dev-ops / sysadmin to join its tech team
based in central Edinburgh.

You will work on physical and virtualised servers, and will be responsible
for package management (we run our own local apt repo), system setup,
configuration, on-going support (applying security updates, monitoring and
proactively responding to system health) as well as helping with our code
deployment and improving reliability and quality through increased testing.


We favour open source: Debian/Ubuntu, Perl, Apache, MySQL & Postgres. We
rely heavily on Git for process and revision control.

Perl isn't a requirement, but we are a Perl shop and we would like to stay
that way.  Aka, it would be well suited to someone wanting to learn more
Perl and could demonstrate they had the right grounding.  That said,
existing Perl experience isn't a bad thing either, it's just not a
requirement to already know it.

You will be wrangling Perl.

No end-user desktop support is involved, beyond ensuring our virtualised
development environments are usable by the rest of our dev team.

Required skills:
● a tenacious eye for detail, good systems design and “working smarter”
pragmatic solutions
● solid Debian/Ubuntu experience and be comfortable with the shell, package
management and day to day sysadmin tasks
● Good knowledge of Apache, modern software revision control (e.g., Git or
similar) and be comfortable with basic SQL
● a good familiarity with at least one modern scripting language (Perl,
Python, Ruby, Bash etc) and a willingness to learn and use Perl
● excellent English and the legal right to work in the UK.

Our Edinburgh tech team is small, focused and has a good degree of
autonomy, so you need to be able to produce great work without a carrot or
stick and be comfortable communicating with the wider business via email,
phone, IM and online tools such as Wikis and Google Drive.

Desired skills:
HTML, JavaScript, CSS skills are not required,	but a basic appreciation is
desirable, as our business is based on the Web.  Your coding will be
primarily for sysadmin, rather than public web-app tasks.
