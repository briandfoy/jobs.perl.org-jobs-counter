Description:
Slando are looking for a Perl developer to join our technology team. Slando
is a small close knit company which embraces Agile development ethos, and
brings together people from diverse backgrounds and cultures which
compliment Slando’s multinational website. As a member of the technology
team you will be expected to learn from, share your knowledge and write
code with your peers. We do not expect you to be a git guru or a debutante
DBA, nor do we expect you to be an expert in Map Reduce and No SQL
architectures, neither do we require you to understand the full
implications of running Lucene with over 15 Million documents in the cloud.
However, we do expect you to be passionate about writing good OO Perl,
preferably using Moose, in an MVC style with a keen interest in being part
of a team which is implementing all of the above technologies and more.

As a small team our development environment embraces quality. We utilise 2
week iteration cycles, with release candidate testing, which allows for
hotfixes. We’re working towards nightly builds and fully automated unit and
selenium testing.

Slando itself is a large Classifieds website, covering 10 countries in 8
different languages, attracting over 70 million page views a month and
growing.. The role itself is based entirely in our central London office,
working hours are 8am to 4:30pm (with some flexibility).

Our Interview process involves an in house written perl test and some
homework, to give you an opportunity to shine and all of us the chance to
find out how well we can work together. We will consider a broad range of
experience levels for the role, if you can prove your skills in our test.

Required skills:
OO Perl
mod_perl
mysql (or simillar)
javascript
jquery|prototype.js|yui etc.
Ajax
HTML


Desired skills:
Moose
DBIx::Class
Java
Lucene/Solr
Map Reduce
Cloud computing
Varnish VCL
Database Design and optimisation - correct use of indexes
