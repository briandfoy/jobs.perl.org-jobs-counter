Description:
Really unique opportunity for a serious scripting, administration, and
troubleshooting guru with Perl, Linux, and Solaris Skills.  You'll handle
daytime support for one of the largest websites in the world, and build
tools that allow your peers to support the website more easily.

Make sure you read the instructions. Replies that don't include the
mandatory information won't be answered.

What we need:

    * Top notch perl and shell scripting skills. Really top-notch. You'll
need to know what a closure is in perl, and how to use it. What errno is in
unix terms, what variable it maps to in perl, and how to use it correctly
with defensive programming skills. What a Schwartzian transform is, why you
might want one, and how to write it.
    * Serious Linux and Solaris Skills Understand deep unix concepts like
sockets, how to do a non-blocking read on a socket. Expert in open source
tools like rsync, ssh, C and Java source code build tools like make, ant,
maven, subversion, hudson, cruise control, etc.  This isn't a comprehensive
list, just to highlight that we're looking for a jack of all trades with
great expertise in the Linux and Solaris space.
    * Apache Guru Full understanding of plugins, mod-proxy, log management,
tuning for open file descriptors, ssl, certificates, etc
    * Great People Skills You'll be working for a small consulting company,
but in our Fortune 200 client's headquarters. Need someone that not only
has great technical skills, but the ability to work with, and coach, other
developers.

Optional Expertise that could seal the deal:

    * Have C++ or Java/Tomcat expertise? You could work on the main website
code as well.
    * Logging and monitoring guru? Do you know splunk, rrd, syslogng, or
other tools well?  Maybe have expertise with JMX? That's a definite plus.
    * Are you a master with performance analysis? Know how to debug a core
file with gdb? Java profiler expert? Or perhaps unix/linux performance
expertise...like mastering dtrace, truss, strace ?
    * ESB expert?  Can you speak ServiceMix or Mule? Understand the guts of
the platform?

What we can offer:

    * Stable, W2 employment with 100% paid medical and dental.
    * The great combo of working for a small company, but within a big
company environment.  You'll be working on one of the 200 largest websites
in the world.
    * Casual work environment.	You do have to be presentable, but jeans
and t-shirts are the norm.
    * It's a fun environment with friendly coworkers...work hard, and
you'll be able to play hard as well.
    * Visibility.  Our small consulting company is led by a former Fortune
500 CTO that can help you with your career goals.
    * Variety.	Aside from the on-the-ground client work, our consulting
company has other great internal opportunities.
    * Competitive compensation, commensurate with your experience. And, the
potential upside of being a first year em[ployee with a small growning
company.

What to send:

    * Your resume. Make sure it highlights the expertise needed above.
    * Some examples backing your expertise.  Have a profile on
perlmonks.com?	Active on a message board that highlights your skills? Send
me the url's

you think you're a great fit for this job. Be sure to include any area of
