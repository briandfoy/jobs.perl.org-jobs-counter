Job title:
web site programmer/producer for media watchdog organization

Company name: Media Matters

Location: United States, DC, Washington

Pay rate: US$35,000-70,000/year

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: long term

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are seeking to hire a full-time person to do web-related technical
work for a new media monitoring organization based in Washington
DC. Job duties include:

  - working closely with an editorial/research staff to do daily
    updates to web content

  - designing new sections of and applications for a highly visible
    web site

  - monitoring servers, doing basic analysis of web traffic and
    performance

  - helping with routine office tech support

Fluency in Perl and HTML are of equal importance for this job. We are
building a large-scale web and research operation in pieces,
prototyping content and applications, then building tools to expand
successful prototypes.

Our database and web publishing environment is built on an Apache +
Perl + HTML::Mason + XML::Comma foundation.

Several additional skills are also important, and applicants who are
not already reasonably comfortable with the following
tools/technologies will be asked to dive in and learn them: linux
systems administration; basic graphics, audio and video editing;
Microsoft Windows XP desktop support.

This is not a nine-to-five job: primary responsibility for daily work
on the web site will fall to the Web Programmer/Producer. In addition,
we will be developing and expanding the web site rapidly, introducing
community-oriented interactive features and multimedia content. We are
seeking a motivated, organized person who wants to help us have an
impact on the quality of political journalism in the United States.

To apply, please send a short note about yourself, describing your
qualifications, your experience doing web-related work, and your level
of proficiency with the tools listed above, to Kwin Kramer
<kwindla@allafrica.com>. Please include a plain text resume (or a link
to an HTML resume posted on the web) in your email. Applications that
include a resume in any format other than plain text will not be read.
