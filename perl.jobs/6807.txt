Job title:
Perl professionals for growing video platform

Company name: Magnify.net

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: Commensurate with experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Ongoing

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Magnify.net's unique community-building service continues to grow, with
over 10,000 sites served by our multi-server mod_perl application, so we’re
looking for experienced Perl professionals to join our fast-moving team in
this outstanding opportunity.

You will work closely with our core team to design and implement features
and deploy them to our live service.

* This is an ongoing full-time contract position.

* All work can be done offsite, via SSH, email, and Skype. (A fully remote
arrangement is acceptable, although if you're close enough to NYC to
commute in for occasional face-to-face meetings, please let us know that as
well.)


Required skills:
* Significant knowledge of and experience in Perl programming. (Exposure to
standard Perl idioms, the ability to create your own class hierarchies, and
familiarity with CPAN are required.)

* Prior experience in server-side web application development. (You should
have worked with page templating systems, session data storage, relational
databases, caching, and inter-process communication.)

* Understanding of professional software development processes. (Including
familiarity with the cycles of requirements definition, issue tracking,
version control, automated testing, deployment and maintenance.)

* Clear and articulate communication, both written and spoken. (Our team
collaborates extensively by email, IM, and phone, and you will need to be
able to read specs and write documentation)


Desired skills:
* Web service operation, scaling, and fault-tolerance using Linux, Apache,
MySQL, and Perl.

* Experience with our server-side toolset, including mod_perl, HTML::Mason,
DBIx::SQLEngine, Cache::Memcached, and other modules from CPAN.

* Familiarity with building rich web interfaces in HTML with CSS and
JavaScript (using Prototype and Scriptaculous for Ajax and client-side
effects), RSS feeds, XML APIs, and client-side Flash widgets.

* Comfort with project support tools including RT, SVN, and automated web
testing.
