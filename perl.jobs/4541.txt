Job title: Perl Optimization Guru

Company name: UV Hosting

Location: United States, MI, Grand Rapids

Pay rate: tba

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have been in the on and off process of writing a website monitoring
system for the last 9 months or so. Think www.atwatch.com or
www.alertra.com or www.watchmouse.com. I have much of it completed. It is
really only my first or second attempt to write 'clean' perl (using
localized variables, passing variables between subroutines, writing it for
mod_perl, using a daemon to launch forks, etc.) as everything before this
has been relatively simple. I have been writing perl in some form for 8+
years though I have never been formally trained or made it my day-job.

What I am looking for is someone who can go over the code, which is about
4000 lines between the various parts of the program (front-end, back-end,
and embedded html), in two facets. The first is to find routines that I am
using frequently -- the type of code such as dbi-mysql queries or getting
data from a form, and show me a more memory & code efficient way to do
those things. The second is when I am 'done' with most or all of the
program, effectively go through it, optimize it, look for logic errors, and
send it back. I suspect that there will be some functions that I wrote very
poorly and I have some idea which those are. The code is also rather
proprietary, so I would like to have some sort of a NDA.

Required skills:
mod_perl2
Template Toolkit
GD library tools
perl daemon experience
perl fork experience
perl dbi using mysql

Desired skills: see required skills
