Job title: Perl Web App Developer

Company name: Bluehost

Location: Orem, UT

Pay rate: BOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Perl Developer will be part of our solutions development team building
the next generation integrated control panel. This team has high visibility
in the division and is important for our ongoing success. The control panel
will support cPanel, our billing system, management of VPS and Dedicated
servers with root access and integration with third party tools. You will
be one of the core developers who will help deliver on the product vision.

Required skills:
■ Talented Perl programmer – You have been around the block a few times and
are comfortable using Perl to make web apps work.
■ Object Oriented Perl – You think Perl is more than "just a scripting
language" and know how to make it do things others can’t. Plus you
understand how Perl’s object orientation differs from other languages such
as C# and Java. 
■ SQL Database Expertise – Our platform is built on MySQL. A SQL background
is extremely valuable to the success of this project. 
■ Web Experience – You are familiar with how the web works, and can hit the
ground running writing web applications and tools. You are able to develop
both for the front end as well as the back end. 
■ Open source world – You have lived in open source code for most or a good
part of your career and are not a fan of the commercial software world. For
example, you have no problem using Vim or Emacs as your “IDE” for Perl.
■ Team Player – You work well as part of a team, and are willing to take
direction, but can be trusted to get things done on your own.
■ Hard Working – Once you get your bearings, you are heads-down and
tenacious in completing assigned projects

Desired skills:
■ At least 5 years experience as an object oriented Perl
■ Must be competent developing Web applications using HTML, CSS and JS
■ Must be competent with SQL 
■ Must be knowledgeable with Linux and basic system administration
■ Ability to stay on task, solve problems, and accomplish tasks in a timely
manner
■ Able to work well with other team members
■ MUST BE QUALIFIED TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES
