Description:
Leading company specialized in marketing and customer intelligence solution
is seeking Software Engineers with a Unix/Linux/Open Source background who
are proficient in Perl for both mod_perl application interface development
and backend data-processing.  

As an open source shop, the company develop exciting and unique solutions
from the ground up and have the opportunity to understand how things work
at the lowest levels, and modify things to work as desired.  Development is
collaborative and in discussions, there is no “X says so,” but rather an
idea or a way of doing things based on common sense and consensus.  Little
specialization, lots of discussion and learning.

The development process is not fully formalized and developers are required
to wear several hats at times, and be involved from analysis and design
through testing, implementation and support of live systems.


Required skills:
Perl, Linux/Unix, SQL.	Applicants must be self motivated, organized, able
to communicate with internal clients, and have the ability to both complete
projects independently and work on small teams.

Desired skills:
C, shell scripting, Oracle or MySQL, Javascript, XML, Apache.
