Job title: ETL Software Engineer

Company name: Ask.com (IAC Search and Media)

Internal ID: *3DF1E279E25A35D7

Location: United States, CA, Oakland

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Every now and then, you get the itch to grab a few terabytes of data, run
it through a wood chipper, cut it up with a brand-new set of Ginsu knives,
add a healthy dose of gasoline, set it on fire, apply a few regular
expressions and then pipe it through a hard little kernel of a C program
you wrote Tuesday night just because you had a good idea on the drive home.


You download CPAN modules just to see how that guy did it. 

You think that reading a book on multi-dimensional search tree sounds like
a nice way to spend an evening. 

You would never, ever, change a hash while inside an each loop, except that
one time when it was funny. 

You are not afraid of databases. Really, really big databases. The kinds
that make Oracle throw up its hands and threaten to go home.

You know how to break Perl’s garbage collector, and how to fix it
afterwards. You think a clickstream is sexy, and playing with a real-time
traffic multicast of a top-tier search engine is something you’d like to
get paid for. 

Ask.com is looking for an experienced Software Engineer to join a team
responsible for business critical data capturing and reporting. We develop
tools that make sense of a never-ending stream of data, slice, dice, and
summarize it all. We write in C and very tight Perl, and SQL is our puppy.
There’s a bit of Java and Ruby around, too, if you are into that.

Responsibilities

    * Design and build software that implements click stream tracking for a
collection of web sites accessed by 10’s of millions of people.
    * Build, and maintain an ETL system used for reporting on business
critical site metrics.
    * Develop and maintain internal tools designed to aid productivity.
    * Handle production issues on a system that stretches across the globe.

    * Maintain/Expand existing reporting systems and analysis tools.
    * Work on ad-hoc information requests from groups world-wide.
    * Participate in third-party software evaluation.
    * Serve as a resource for development on other team projects and
products as needed. 

Required skills:
Perl expertise, specifically in relation to: regular expressions,
intercommunications with databases (Oracle) using DBI, XML, and module
development.

Experience using C

Desired skills:
UNIX shell scripting (bash).
UNIX administration skills.
Java/C++ programming a plus.
