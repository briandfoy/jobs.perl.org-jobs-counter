Job title: Perl Web Application Developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C15

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey is the online market research technology leader.	We are a
privately held company based in Southern California.  We also have an
office in Lexington, KY, and remote staff in various other locations around
the country.

Our leading edge software includes tools for creating and managing complex
online surveys, real-time reports, and terabyte-scale data management.	We
use this software internally and also license it to select clients via an
ASP model.  We seek to hire a Web Application Developer to support
development of our core web applications. 

Responsibilities:

Your primary responsibility will be to improve our core software by adding
features and fixing bugs. You will also be responsible for helping to
monitor and manage our servers, and for occasionally providing technical
support to our clients.


Required skills:
Your primary activity will be coding very large database-backed web
applications in object-oriented Perl, so we'd prefer to hire someone with
plenty of advanced Perl experience.  However, if you can write excellent*
code in any language then we'd like to hear from you.  You will be expected
to work independently, show initiative, and have a professional manner with
clients.

*excellent -- of highest quality; plus: easy to read and explain; easy to
extend; possible to debug; and timely.
