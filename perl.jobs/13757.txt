Job title: Graduate Developer

Company name: Nestoria

Location: Clerkenwell, London

Pay rate: £25,000 - £35,000

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are seeking an intelligent, motivated and forward thinking developer to
work on the Nestoria property search engine, and to help us continue
serving millions of house hunters in eight countries and six languages.

As a developer at Nestoria you will be responsible for the maintenance and
continued improvement of our property search engine. We have a reputation
for providing a fast and clean search experience to our users, allowing
them to quickly find the properties which are the most relevant to them.

The Role:

The challenges we face at Lokku are similar to those faced by larger search
engines such as Google. On the one hand we have a huge amount of data that
we need to analyse, clean up, extract keywords from, geocode and
de-duplicate. On the other hand we have a very popular website that needs
to remain highly stable and lightning fast.

We consider development to cover all aspects of the web experience, from
the client side with jQuery, CSS and HTML back to the server side
templating, localization, and of course the search engine itself. You will
have the opportunity to branch out into any parts of the code base which
interest you, to pitch in with the rest of the developers and make Nestoria
the best it can be.

You will be a member of our small, highly collaborative, international team
(15 total, 5 devs), which will mean working closely with both other
developers and with non-technical team members from our product development
and commercial teams. From day one you will be encouraged to engage with
senior management and interns alike, and make suggestions and contribute
ideas into our product planning process.

We don’t work in a formalised Agile / XP process but have organically
developed methods that allow us to manage development effectively. The core
values for us are true ownership for devs of their work and maximum
transparency during the planning process. We are committed to continuous
deployment, testing, refactoring and code maintainability.

About Nestoria:

We like to give something back to the technology communities we're involved
in, and are especially keen on contributing to the Perl (CPAN) and
Geo-spatial open source development communities. We make our API available
to developers, are frequent sponsors of relevant events and operate
#geomob, a quarterly meet up for geo and mobile enthusiasts.

We also like to give back to our team members. We invest time into
expanding our collective knowledge through attending conferences and
training days, and through our own internal tech talks where each week one
engineer presents to the team about any subject. Each developer in the team
has an annual training budget allocated to them, and is expected to search
out and suggest training opportunities. In August 2013, for example, the
entire development team attended the 3-day YAPC::EU conference in Kiev,
Ukraine.

Required skills:
You are fresh, eager, willing to learn, and probably a recent graduate. 
You’ve used a few different programming languages, maybe even Perl.  You
know Linux well, and probably have used some scripting (Perl/Python/Ruby)
and/or compiled languages (C/Objective-C).  You have a good understanding
of programming concepts and algorithms.  

You are looking for a great role in a small, tightly-knit team which
affords you a high degree of responsibility and a diverse range of juicy
projects to work on and learn from.

Required skills:

•	Experience running and developing on UNIX/Linux platforms
(we use Debian)
•	Experience with Perl, or with other scripting languages such as
Python or Ruby
(we will teach you to write modern, readable Perl)
•	Understanding of SQL-based relational databases
•	Knowledge of the internet and of web development
•	A pragmatic and practical approach to solving problems
•	Some understanding of Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc),
plus XML, JSON, LAMP stack

Desired skills:
It is also desirable but not essential that you have some of the following:


•	Knowledge of modern client-side web technologies
•	Ability to write and maintain C code
•	Experience with internationalization and character encoding
•	Good understanding of test-driven development
•	Understanding of revision control
