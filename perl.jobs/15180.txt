Job title: Data Scientist

Company name: QuantiModo

Location: Glenn Carbon, Illinois

Pay rate: $30,000-$80,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
You are excited to play a leading role in using data to identify causal
relationships using irregular time series data. You are experienced in all
aspects of designing, implementing and scaling the architecture to process
large amounts of data.
Primary Objective: Quantify the effectiveness of
treatments for specific individuals, reveal hidden factors exacerbating
their illness, and determine personalized optimal daily values for these
factors.
Approach: You will improve our time-series data mining algorithms
to quantify correlations between every combination of variables for a given
subject. We will also design algorithms capable of determining the minimum
quantities of nutrient intake, sleep, exercise, medications, and other
factors necessary to minimize symptom severity.
Impact: You will mitigate
the incidence of chronic illness by informing the user of symptom triggers,
such as dietary sensitivities, to be avoided. This will also assist
patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments
despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive
experiment.

Desired skills:
PHP, Analytics & Reporting, Big Data, Databases, Analytics, Predictive
Analytics, Data Science, Mathematical Algorithms/Data Analysis,
HTML/CSS/PHP/MYSQL
