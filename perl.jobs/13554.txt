Job title: Find Proxies perl script

Company name: MPR

Location: CA

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a research project that I need to do on a search engine but I need
to automate it. Im looking for a way to harvest proxies so that I can do
this research fast. 

Im looking to have a developer to write something that will go out on to
the web and find open proxies. I was thinking of using pxytest which is a
command line utility to test a host for open proxies. Here is a copy of the
perl script: 

http://www.fileswap.com/dl/AZFs6yRKkd/

Now what I need is a bot to provide this script with IP addresses to test.
So you will have to create something that goes out on a continual basis and
looks for ip addresses, then tests the IP for open ports. Then when the
above script finds a proxy that is open it will need to test the speed of
the connection. Any that can resolve a common url in say 10 seconds are put
into the good_proxy.csv file. Any that are bad are not kept. 

Email me with questions or bids.
