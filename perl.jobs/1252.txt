Job title:
Advanced Perl/MySQL developer for Yahoo! Finance

Company name: Yahoo!

Location: 95014, CA, Sunnyvale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Full-time position at Yahoo! in Sunnyvale, CA.				   
    
									   
    
Want to work on web pages that get over a million hits an _hour_, for a    
    
Web-based company that's still actually making a profit? Yahoo! Finance    
    
(finance.yahoo.com) has an immediate opening for an engineer with advanced 
    
Perl skills.								   
    
									   
    
Every day, Yahoo! Finance works with a dizzying amount of financial news   
    
and data. The folding, spindling, and mutilating of that data into a useful
    
information leveraged across the entire suite of Yahoo properties requires 
    
some heavy-duty Perl.							   
    
									   
    
The successful candidate will be a good programmer in general, be very	   
    
comfortable working with large-scale Perl installations, be conversant with
    
Unix, be a serious team player, and have a strong "go get 'em" attitude. At
    
least intermediate SQL skills required (MySQL a plus).			   
    
									   
    
The problems to be solved are extremely challenging, but the work and the  
    
whole environment here is even more-so rewarding.			   
    
									   
    
Salary is competitive and the benefits extensive, including all the	   
    
old-time Silicon Valley perks (health/dental/eye, multiple espresso bars,  
    
stock options, frequent parties, 401k, employee stock purchase program,    
    
etc.)									   
    
									   
    
Let me emphasize that fairly advanced Perl skills are required. You don't  
    
have to know every little detail, but things like Perl's OO implementation 
    
details, references, deep data structures, and regular expressions must be 
    
Well and Truly understood.						   
    
									   
    
Come find out why I've been having too much fun to put out a third edition 
    
of _Mastering Regular Expressions_. Send your resume or an informal note   
    
directly to me at jfriedl@yahoo-inc.com [plain text or html preferred].     

Required skills: Advanced Perl. SQL

Desired skills: Unix, Web technologies
