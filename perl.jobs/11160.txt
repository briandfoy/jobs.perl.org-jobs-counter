Job title: Perl Web Programmer

Company name: JST Software, Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Santa Monica

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
A new startup based in downtown Santa Monica, CA is looking for a great
Perl web programmer. Someone deeply familiar with web programming from the
front-end to the back-end. The more experience with Linux and the
server-side of things the better, but it's not required.

For the time being we're hiring on a contract basis, with potential for a
full-time position that includes salary and equity.

Candidates in Santa Monica or Los Angeles are preferred, but working
remotely is also possible for the right programmer.

Please do not send your resume without code samples. We're looking for Perl
programmers, not PERL programmers and we need a way to filter. We think
code is the best filter.


We are *much* more likely to be interested if you complete this small
programming exercise:

====================================================
  Perl Programming Exercise #1 (jobs.perl.org)
====================================================

Write a module that fetches the jobs listed on the front page of
http://jobs.perl.org.

It should implement the following API:

-- SNIP --
use PerlJobs;

my $perl_jobs = PerlJobs->new;

my @current_jobs = $perl_jobs->current_jobs;

-- SNIP --

If the 'current_jobs' method fails @current_jobs should be empty, and
if successful it should look like this:

@current_jobs = (
  {
      title => 'Perl Software Engineer - Search Products',
      company => 'CBS Interactive',
      location => 'United States, CA, San Francisco',
      job_url => 'http://jobs.perl.org/job/13438',
      company_url =>
'http://jobs.perl.org/redirect?url=http://cbsinteractive.com/jobsearch.php?
mode=single&SID=%5Eu49K7KlGuuxFf7Di0ykm_slp_rhc_FcS41AzLArn/8F',
      date => '2011-01-06',
  }, {
      title => 'Perl Sr Developer,  JMS, Web Technologies,
Experience in SQL, develop in Linux OS',
      company => 'WSP International',
      location => 'Mexico, Nuevo Leon, Monterrey',
      job_url => 'http://jobs.perl.org/job/13436',
      company_url =>
'http://jobs.perl.org/redirect?url=http://www.wsp.com.mx/',
      date => '2011-01-06',
  },
  ...
);

1) Your code should not use regular expressions to parse the HTML.
2) Your code should be as robust as possible to changes of the HTML.
3) Using appropriate CPAN modules is *highly* encouraged.
4) For an extra challenge split location into country, city, and
state_or_province.
