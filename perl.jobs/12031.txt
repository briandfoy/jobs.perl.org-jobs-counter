Job title: Senior Perl Software Engineer

Location: Dulles, VA

Pay rate: w2 70/hr or c2c 65/hr

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The client operates over a dozen Perl/CGI systems that are tightly coupled
to stored procedures in Sybase databases. From time to time data issues pop
up, and need to be investigated to find the source of the issue. Sometimes
this is bad data in an upstream system, sometimes it is a bug in the way
the data is being handled. Strong analytical, system administration, and
database skills required.
Fixing someone else's code, without much documentation or any guidance
requires several years of development experience. Finding, fixing, testing
and deploying the solutions is part of the job, as is documenting what
happened -- so that the next person may have an easier time. Some of the
systems need support for up to six month, until a replacement system is in
place. Other systems need long term support and require code clean-ups and
ports to newer platforms.

Required skills:
MUST HAVE:
·	  2+ years of work experience with PERL.
·	  4+ years of work experience in Object-Oriented Programming.
·	  4+ years of work experience in use of SQL and stored procedures
in Sybase and MySQL.
·	  Web Services: understanding of how to build and deploy web
services on Apache using Perl CGI. HTML, JavaScript and JQuery knowledge
helpful. Java Servlet deployment on Tomcat also helpful.
·	  Linux OS: comfortable editing (i.e. vi), debugging and building
applications in Redhat/CentOS platforms. Basic Linux System Administrator
skills helpful.

Desired skills:
SKILL MATRIX:
·	  Bachelors degree (CS) or 4-6 years equivalent experience
·	  Strong analytical and troubleshooting skills
·	  Perl
·	  SQL, Stored Procedures, Sybase
·	  Linux, SysAdmin skills
·	  Java
·	  PKI, Certificates
·	  Identity Management
·	  Access Management, Compliance (SOX)
