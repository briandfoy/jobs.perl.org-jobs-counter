Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Growing consulting company End Point Corporation seeks a strong Perl
programmer to develop web applications. We're especially interested in
individuals with deep database experience (complex SQL queries, custom
functions, constraints, triggers, etc.).

Our developers interact directly with our clients via telephone and email,
so we require excellent verbal and written communication skills. Good
candidates pay attention to detail, are careful with production systems,
and code defensively to provide good stability and maintainability of
mission-critical systems.

This is a full-time salaried position. Employees work either from home
offices or at our office in Manhattan, and must live in the 48 contiguous
United States. An applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
allowed to work in the U.S.

Required skills:
Perl, Linux/Unix, web application development. Exposure to the Interchange
application server is a plus, and willingness to learn it well is a
necessity.


Desired skills:
PostgreSQL and/or MySQL, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, e-commerce experience.
