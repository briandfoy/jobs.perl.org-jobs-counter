Job title: Perl/JavaScript Developer for Health company

Company name: Restore Health

Location: Madison, WI

Pay rate: $60-80k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We need someone to develop and support our perl-based pharmacy system.
There are web portals for physicians, pharmacists, outside pharmacies,
sales management, and more to come.

We use jQuery and many of the latest HTML5 APIs on the front and perl in
the back. We only develop for Chrome to ease development. 

Perl is mostly used to get/set things in the database, but also convert
PDFs, import data from other systems, interface with APIs, and other perly
things.

A strong mysql background is required as well. 

The servers are all FreeBSD based. FreeBSD works differently than linux and
some familiarity with *BSD is a plus. ZFS is also a plus.

Right now I'd imagine the position is 50% perl, 30% JavaScript, 20% mysql. 



Our company was #79 on the Inc 500's fastest growing companies in 2013. We
have lots of new requirements coming in and need someone that can grow with
us.

The position is in Madison, WI. We can be flexible in the beginning, but it
will need to be an onsite position. We are looking for someone immediately.

Required skills:
Perl
mysql
javascript
HTML5

Desired skills:
HTML
CSS3 styles
FreeBSD
ZFS
