Job title:
Senior Perl Developer, High Traffic Website, £40-45k

Company name: SpareRoom.co.uk

Location:
United Kingdom, Cheshire, Manchester / Macclesfield

Pay rate: £40,000 - £45,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
* Essential: Perl (procedural, NOT oo) & Mysql
* Desirable: mod_perl, apache, linux

Senior Perl developer required to join our small development team running
the UK's No 1 Flatshare website at a very exciting stage of the company's
development - now serving almost 2 million users and about to launch in the
US. 

You will be supporting and maintaining the existing web application as well
as developing new features. 

There's the opportunity for the right person to progress quickly towards
promotion to heading the team, so good communication skills and ability to
lead a team are desirable. 

You are a creative and pragmatic problem solver who is as comfortable
rolling up their sleeves and getting their hands dirty as they are speccing
out jobs and project managing.

Previous experience of working on a high traffic site, along with the
unique challenges that brings, is highly desirable. Perl and mysql are
essential, and mod_perl would be useful. The code is primarily NOT object
orientated code, so oo experience is not needed. Obviously HTML, but
reasonable proficiency with css and javascript (and/or jquery) would be
beneficial (but not essential by any means). Linux and some 'sysadmin' is
also preferred. 

We are a small friendly company based next to Macclesfield Train station,
which has fast trains to Stockport (15 mins), Manchester (25 mins), Stoke
on Trent (15 mins) and London (1 hour 40mins). 


Required skills:
* Perl
* Mysql

Desired skills:
* Apache
* mod_perl
* linux
