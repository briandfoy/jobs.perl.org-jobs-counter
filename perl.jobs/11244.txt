Job title:
Perl Developer for a Retail Company in Arlington, TX

Company name: TEKsystems

Internal ID: 11111

Location: United States, TX, Arlington

Pay rate: Based on Experience

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 6 Month Contract to Hire

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Perl developer will join a senior team of 4 in the development group at
This client on a 6 month contract to hire basis. Developer will be
responsible for designing, developing, testing and maintaining the primary
application that runs This client's 650 plus stores. Application is
considered a POS application but also is responsible for Pawn transactions,
loans, check cashing, money orders, inventory control, audits, jewelry
reprocessing, inventory transfers between stores, collections and
reporting. Each country (US and Mexico), state, county and city can have
different laws and regulations that may affect the Pawn and short term loan
business. This adds to the complexity and customization of the application
for each This client location. This is a tight knit group that works very
well together. They hold themselves to a high standard and expect to
produce a product that is easily scalable and maintainable by anyone on the
team. Four person team supports the entire application so there is
sometimes a need for after hours support. However, things are automated to
the point where they may do some weekend support but they don't get woken
up at night. Dress Code is casual.

Required skills:
1. Perl Development
2. SQL Queries
3. Linux / Unix OS support experience 

Desired skills:
The first challenge is that the POS application supports almost every
aspect of daily operations within the 650 plus store locations. In order
for the stores to operate, they must have this application up running
efficiently. Without the POS application the stores are unable to conduct
business. The second challenge is supporting the Executive team from a
reporting standpoint. The POS application collects critical data that is
used by the executive team to make extremely impactful business decisions.
Without the POS application operational, stores can not conduct business
and profits are lost. Every minute that the system is down, This client is
operating at a loss. Continuous problems with the POS system could lead to
decreasing revenues due to inability to buy and sell products, issue and
collect loans and a loss of business to their competitors. Executives
require the correct data and reporting tools in order to make proper
business decisions. Without that the company direction could suffer and the
stock price could fall. This client is the one of the leading Pawn and
Check Cashing company in the USA and the largest in Mexico. They have had
growth of 20% year over year for the last 10 years and have recently had
growth of over 30% in their last two quarters. They have 600 current
locations in the US and Mexico and are planning on adding at least 70 new
locations per year for the foreseeable future with the majority of that
growth being in Mexico where they have very little competition. This client
offers a casual work environment with a full benefits package including
Medical, Vision, Dental, 401K match, Paid time off, tuition reimbursement,
life insurance and short and long term disability. They are a growing
company that offers stability and a work environment that results in a very
low turnover rate.
