Job title: Perl/Mason/HTML Programmer

Company name: Step Communications

Location: United States, CA, Cupertino

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Step is a financial content aggregator and software development company and
have been in business since 1999. Like most dotcoms, we were hit with rough
times but we were able to survive and now things are really starting to
gain momentum.

Our customers are in Japan and here's one of our web ites
dj.usmarketatlas.com. This is a Japanese language financial web site which
provides news, research tools, charts, etc for US stocks. Don't be
frightened by the Japanese on the website; it's plus for the candidate to
have Japanese language skills but it is definitely not necessary (we have
posted another job which requires Japanese language skills). For this
posting we are primarily looking for a candidate with very strong perl
skills.

The terms of employment are flexible - salaried, hourly independent
contractor, or project-base. However, we would like to start off on a
project basis so that we can determine the skill level of the candidate.

Telecommuting is okay.


Required skills:
Mason, Apache, HTML, Linux, mysql, good design skills, clean code

Desired skills: Japanese language skills
