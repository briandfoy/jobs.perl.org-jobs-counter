Description:
You will work closely with Magnify's core team to design and implement

This is an outstanding opportunity for the fearless Perl professional to

and the chance to join a team that is building something really unique
while having great times doing so. 
Terms: This is a permanent, full-time position will initially be filled on
an independent contractor basis, successful hires will be given an
opportunity to move to a salary basis with benefits and options. 

Setting: We are based at 27th in Manhattan, although some of the work can
be done off-site, periodical participation of on-site development meeting
will be require, so the candidate will have to be within a commutable

Required skills:
* Significant knowledge of and experience in Perl programming. (Exposure to
standard Perl idioms, the ability to create your own class hierarchies, and
familiarity with CPAN are required.) 

* Prior experience in server-side web application development. (You should
have worked with multiple page templating systems, session data storage,
relational databases, caching, and inter-process communication.) 

* Understanding of professional software development processes. (Including
familiarity with the cycles of requirements definition, issue tracking,
version control, automated testing, deployment and maintenance.) 

* Clear and articulate communication, both written and spoken. (Our team
collaborates extensively by email, IM, and phone, and you will need to be
able to read specs and write documentation)

Desired skills:
* Web service operation, scaling, and fault-tolerance using Linux, Apache,
MySQL, and Perl. 

* Our server-side tools include mod_perl, HTML::Mason, 
DBIx::SQLEngine, Cache::Memcached, and other modules from CPAN. 

* User interfaces are constructed in HTML with CSS and JavaScript (using
Prototype and Scriptaculous for Ajax and client-side effects),RSS feeds,
XML APIs, and client-side Flash widgets. 

* Project support tools including RT, SVN, and automated web testing.
