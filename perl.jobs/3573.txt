Job title:
WAP (Perl/MySQL) Developer for Mobile Entertainment Solutions Developer

Company name: AirG

Location: Canada, BC, Vancouver

Pay rate: negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
How often does an opportunity come along to build a product that will end
up in the hands of millions of customers and shape the future of the mobile
entertainment industry? 

At AirG we’re developing global communities that resonate with the hip and
trend defining 16 – 30 demographic. We’re working with industry leaders
such as TELUS, Verizon and Sprint to define an entirely new way of
interacting with your mobile phone. In our ideally situated office on
fashionable Robson Street in Vancouver, we’re creating products that enable
millions of customers to experience a sense of being connected. Online.
Wirelessly.

You have specialized skills in developing server side application code
using LAMP architecture and consider yourself to be a whiz at bringing new
applications to life.

You can handle all of the typical developer responsibilities – developing,
debugging, testing and documenting – with an innate curiosity that sets you
apart. You have outstanding people skills that make you a great team player
and enable you to provide the best customer service to AirG’s numerous
carrier partners. You are always thinking of ways to enhance, improve or
otherwise make better what you’ve just done. Your peers appreciate your
willingness to question the status quo, in a respectful way, and you aren’t
afraid to speak your mind for the good of the product and to push the limit
of the technology.

You have an undergraduate degree in computing science, engineering, or
equivalent and 3 years' development experience that will enable you to
start changing the face of how millions of mobile users interact.

In addition to having a flexible and relaxed work environment, we believe
that our culture and values set us apart. The values that we all share and
look for in those we work with include being entrepreneurial, passionate,
creative and fun. AirG offers an attractive and competitive compensation
package, a comprehensive benefits plan including a flexible wellness
program and staff purchase plan for mobile devices.

Plug in to the world's largest interconnected mobile community. Plug in to
AirG.
