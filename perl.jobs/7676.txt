Job title: Senior Developer on distributed system

Company name: SiteScout

Location: United States, Washington, Seattle

Pay rate: US$60-100K (approx.)

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Are you ready to apply your passion for Perl to help build and extend a
distributed system running 24x7 on hundreds of machines? To develop
reliable, maintainable, cross-platform code using Perl's OO and functional
programming capabilities, performing interesting text munging tasks and
large-scale data manipulation and gluing together disparate technologies to
build an automated system that makes the Web safer? To earn something like
$60-100K per year, depending on experience, plus benefits and stock
options? 

We're looking for experienced software developers who feel a burning desire
to take ownership and ship successful products, mastering a broad range of
technical capabilities as necessary to get the job done effectively. You
should strive to write maintainable, scalable, well-tested code that
satisfies customer needs in a fluid and fast-moving market. You need the
capacity to think big yet still sweat the details, and to be able
communicate effectively both within a technical team and with business
stakeholders. You should be excited by the opportunity to make the Web a
better place -- even if you're personally a Linux junkie, we're looking for
recognition that much of the world runs Windows and needs our help.

In the near term, we expect this position to be primarily an individual
contributor, but we're looking for someone who can has the potential to be
a dev lead/manager within six months to a year. We want you to grow with
us.

About us: SiteScout is a startup funded by experienced and committed angel
investors, with a working product and active engagements with prospective
OEM partners for our technology. Our mission is to make the Web safer by
proactively identifying malicious Web sites and helping prevent them from
harming people's computers. We use Perl extensively at the heart of our
automated system: to manage workflow, to analyze huge volumes of HTML
(think billions of Web pages) and associated data like link graphs to drive
our Web interfaces, and to glue together various other technologies
including C# and C++ code that performs malware analysis on Windows
systems. We use a mixture of LAMP-ish and Windows-flavored technology:
MySQL as a data store; Apache both to support Web interfaces and as an IPC
mechanism; Subversion for source control; Win32 API calls, OLE, and various
other Microsoft technologies to locate and characterize Windows-based
malware. Development and production occur both on Linux and Windows, and we
rely extensively on virtualization technology. And yes, we track bugs
rigorously and have extensive suites of unit and integration tests and QA
processes to help support our development efforts. Although we're a small
team -- just a handful of full-time developers and QA/operations folks,
plus contractors -- we're serious about building manageable systems and
processes, not just hacking away as individual contributors (though we’re
not big-M Methodology addicts).

We've got a great work environment (views, windows that open, fast
multi-monitor machines, and a fun team) and are working hard to solve
interesting problems that make a difference to people. Sound like your kind
of challenge? Send your resume and a brief introduction explaining why you
think you'd be a good fit.

(Just a note: compensation really depends on how much value you can add. We
believe in finding the right person and negotiating a mutually lucrative
arrangement rather than specifying strict salary guidelines in a job
posting. But we're serious about attracting great talent and prepared to
pay accordingly.)


Required skills:
You should have been through a complete development lifecycle on at least
two product releases. You must have very strong Perl experience and be able
to demonstrate your ability to write OO and functional-style Perl code as
part of a team, not just as a solo coder. You should have solid database
experience and be able to create normalized tables, write and understand
complex joins, and understand performance implications when dealing with
tens of millions of data rows. (This is not predominantly a CRUD
development effort, but everyone needs to be able to grok our data model
and employ it effectively.)


Desired skills:
Solid experience in C, C++, and/or C# is also a plus, as is knowledge of
HTTP, TCP/IP, JavaScript, and other Internet/Web technologies. If you have
knowledge of Windows internals and/or experience in security and malware,
that's a huge bonus. We prefer a bachelor's degree in computer science or a
related quantitative discipline or extensive industry experience.
