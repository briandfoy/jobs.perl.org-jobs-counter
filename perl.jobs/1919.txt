Job title:
Perl (MOD_Perl) Expert for Short-Term E-Commerce Project

Location: United States, WA, Bellevue

Pay rate: $4000-$5000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 4-6 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
Small, Bellevue-based web company is seeking a single Perl developer for a
short-term 6-8 week project. 

We have a nearly-complete e-commerce site (75%+) that has been built with
Perl/MySQL and a design for the site that has not yet been implemented with
the code. We would need a developer to read through the code, complete the
parts that still need work and add the design (gifs & jpegs are already cut
up and ready for use) into the site. 

Once the site is complete (should be 3-4 weeks) we will need you to
maintain and watch it for errors, etc. when it goes live. This will
comprise the remainder of the work. 

We are seeking a developer after this project for several other projects of
simliar compensation and if work is satisfactory, you would be our
first-choice.

Requirements: 

Must be able to work on-site at least 2 days each week. 
Need a fast efficient developer with a proven track record of completed
projects. E-commerce projects are preferable. 
Examples of completed projects required. 
Knowledge of web development in Perl and MySQL on a linux platform. 
Strong database and SQL knowledge. 
The website utilizes the HTML-EmbPerl module - working knowledge of this
module is not required, but you will be required to familiarize yourself
with it and ramp up quickly.
