Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: long term

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am seeking an experienced programmer to revise and maintain a complex
Mason site.

Most revisions will not be urgent, but urgency is always a possibility.

This position will NOT provide consistent employment, rather revisions and
maintenance will be sporadic.  An established programmer/consultant is
ideal.

It's a complex site, I am looking for a programmer who will familiarize
himself with the code and be available in the long term.  Original
programmer is available to help with familiarization.

Site is "mildly adult" in nature, ie, it is "adult personals."	

You MUST have experience with Mason web apps.  Please reference other sites
you have coded.

Refer to 
http://www.fetishpersonals.com:8080/personals_revision/flowchart.html
for an example of how I communicate my vision of the site to you.
(Note, finishing this almost-completed revision will be your first
project.)

Required skills:
HTML::Mason web apps experience.  Perl.  
Server admin would be nice but not required.

Desired skills:
High level programmer only.  This is a complex and mission critical site,
only experienced Mason web apps programmers will be considered.
