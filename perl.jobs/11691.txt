Description:
Non-Profit Organization looking for creative programmer to build new
side-project website with an interactive user interface for our clients. 
Site requirements include: user log in, user-maintained profiles, profile
navigation/search (geo-based search) and e-commerce money exchange with
third party processor (Amazon, PayPal or other).  

For the purpose of program creation, this position will work closely with

Upon site completion, full-time web development and maintenance will be
necessary.  An ideal candidate could fulfill short term goals and
ultimately play a major role in new company expansion.	Full-time
employment perks would include vacation, no defined schedule and you’ll be
employee #3 with real equity.

Required skills:
-Experience and high confidence with infrastructure development (No age or
year specifically)
-Write code and solve problems across new platform [Perl, SQL, HTML,
JavaScript, (jQuery, Ajax)]
-Work to define/build out multiple infrastructures for future projects
-Define and build high-performance, high-availability infrastructure
-Solve complex geospatial problems
-Optimize and troubleshoot complex distributed systems

Desired skills:
-live and breathe open-source systems 
-build systems that scale to millions of users
-love to tweak code/configuration files to get optimal performance — less
machines the better
-code in whatever language is required to get the job done
-work with others to solve problems, not assign the blame
-enjoy new challenges and the startup atmosphere
