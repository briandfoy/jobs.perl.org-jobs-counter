Job title: Senior Perl Developer - telecommute

Company name: Betonmarkets.com

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Betonmarkets.com is a leading fixed-odds financial betting company with
offices in Malta and Malaysia. Founded in 1999, the company has in recent
years experienced very strong growth, with the average number of bets
transacted per day rising 6-fold over the last 4 years.

Betonmarkets' codebase is developed entirely in-house in Perl. Various
parts of the code were developed at various points in the company's 14-year
history, with some code being legacy procedural code and other code being
recent state of the art Moose/oop design.

We are seeking a senior and experienced Perl developer on a telecommute
basis to help us complete the refactoring of legacy procedural code to our
oop library.

Relevant code spans multiple domains: financial data feeds, database and
transactions, quant (financial derivatives) pricing algorithms, marketing
and website-related code, payments and banking systems code, and the
development of an API.

This is a unique opportunity for a talented and experienced Perl developer
to apply his or her skills to a complex and high-traffic ecommerce website
and gain experience with financial markets, as well as to participate in a
fast-growing industry-leading company.

Required skills:
We are seeking someone with solid Perl and OOP skills and experience, who
is able to hit the ground running and gain mastery over what is at times
large and complex code. We seek an individual who is well versed in
software engineering best practices and is able to make independent
decisions based on common sense, good judgment, commercial nous, as well as
Perl and OOP best practices and coding standards.

This is a senior position for a person with at least 15 years experience in
software engineering and who is excited about the prospect of working as a
senior individual contributor, within however the framework of a global
distributed team of similarly talented and senior developers. Ideally we
are looking for an individual who may have held prior senior positions such
as CTO, and who would now welcome the opportunity to work as an individual
contributor, enjoying the feeling of "flow" that the best programmers
experience when working productively.

Strong experience with Moose, MVC frameworks such as Mojolicious, jQuery,
Postgres, Linux, is a must, as well as a disciplined coding approach (e.g.
TDD) and understanding of industry best practices.
