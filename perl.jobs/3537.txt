Job title: Telecommute Python OR  Perl Programmer

Company name: Client

Location: United States, Telecommute - Off-site

Pay rate: Open / Hourly

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Multiple weeks

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
My client is seeking a telecommute Python programmer to implement a web
robot

Please see this link for full job details:
http://www.superiorss.com/jobs.htm

They are interested in getting a prototype working quickly (within the next
several weeks). It's not necessary for the prototype to implement a
"JavaScript-enabled" or "capture-enabled" webbot (as described in the
specification) but the webbot should be designed so that these features can
be added later, without re-implementing the core functionality.

Required skills:
Since many of our tools are written in Python, our first choice would be to
have the robot written in Python, perhaps using Python extensions to embed
Internet Explorer and/or Mozilla. However, we are open to the possibility
of having the robot implemented in another language (e.g., Perl using
Win32::IE::Mechanize) if it turns out to be substantially easier.
