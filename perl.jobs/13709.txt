Job title: Senior Sysadmin & Perl Developer for directorship

Location: Edinburgh, United Kingdom

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are a software startup company, in early stages and in the process of
securing funding, for this position and others.

We are looking for a person to be second in command on all matters
technical, so technical seniority and ability to make business priorities
is essential. System uptime and management will be your primary
responsibility and programming an area where your contribution can be
adapted to suit your profile. There are also non-technical tasks, including
documentation and developing work processes. This is not a managerial
position.

If you are interested in working for a startup in Edinburgh, get a chance
to shape your role and the company and have opportunity to telecommute up
to two days per week, please send us a few lines about who you are, and we
will send you more information after which you can choose to apply for the
position.

As this is a key role, you would be a director of the company and you would
be offered stock options.

This role depends on us securing funding, so there will be some time before
the full time employment will start. You will be expected to make yourself
a little familiar with the company before you start, in your own time, but
we would of course not expect any major commitment before that time.

We are committed to making an effort at not discriminating based on sex,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, body size, personal style and
looks or anything else that is not relevant to your performance, and we aim
to accommodate for disabilities. There is zero tolerance of bullying and
power games, no matter position in the company.

Required skills:
* Linux and/or BSD systems administration
* Rock solid understanding of and experience with scripting in Perl and
shell
* Ability to understand and work constructively with code that is not
object oriented, and deliver readable, well formatted code
* Familiarity with general Perl programming and SQL databases, although an
ambition to learn in this area is the most important
* Deep understanding of systems security and performance tuning
* Very good understanding of TCP/IP networking
