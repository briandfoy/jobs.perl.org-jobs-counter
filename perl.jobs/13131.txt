Description:
* Australia's leading not-for-profit social enterprise
* Fun & passionate agile development team

We're seeking passionate, enthusiastic developers to join a small team of
software engineers at our friendly, easygoing head office in Richmond,
Melbourne. You will be working to design, develop, test and deploy exciting
front-end and back-end development solutions for our welfare, community and
government based clientèle.

We require motivated and talented programmers with practical (but not

complex systems and can come up with creative solutions to some of the
unique challenges we're facing.

About you:

* You're passionate about web development and open source and love writing
beautiful code.
* You've developed web applications using Perl, Python, PHP or other open
source languages that are used by real people right now.
* You're not afraid to learn new languages and APIs.
* You've got solid SQL skills (PostgreSQL preferred).
* You've got a good grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* MS or BS in computer science or a related field.

Nice-to-haves:

* Experience working in agile environments and TDD.
* Experience with an MVC framework like Django or Rails.
* An active Github account.
* Familiar with e-health standards (HL7, Nehta).
* Passion for social enterprise and the not-for-profit sector.

What you'll gain with us:

* Work on complex and exciting products that contribute to a fairer
society.
* Experience working with open source technologies and opportunities to
contribute to them.
* Flexible working arrangements (e.g. working from home)
* Infoxchange provides monthly massages if you make a small contribution to
the Social Committee.
* Richmond office right next to train station and close to awesome food on
Victoria street.
* Great gear. You'll have a powerful Ubuntu desktop with plenty of screen
space to make sure you've got what you need to do great work.
