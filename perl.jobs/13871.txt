Job title: Web Developer

Company name: Nestoria

Location: Clerkenwell, London

Pay rate: £30,000 - £45,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are seeking an intelligent, motivated and forward thinking Web Developer
to work on the Nestoria property search engine, and to help us continue
serving millions of house hunters in eight countries and six languages.

As a web developer at Nestoria you will be responsible for the maintenance
and continued improvement of our property search engine. We have a
reputation for providing a fast and clean search experience to our users,
allowing them to quickly find the properties which are the most relevant to
them. We use modern web technologies and take things like responsive design
and typography seriously.

The Role:

We consider web development to cover all aspects of the web experience,
from the client side with jQuery, CSS and HTML back to the server side
templating, localization, and of course the search engine itself. You will
have the opportunity to branch out into any other parts of the code base
which interest you, to pitch in with the rest of the developers and make
Nestoria the best it can be.

You will be a member of our small, highly collaborative, international team
(15 total, 5 devs), which will mean working closely with both other
developers and with non-technical team members from our product development
and commercial teams. From day one you will be encouraged to engage with
senior management and interns alike, and make suggestions and contribute
ideas into our product planning process.

We don’t work in a formalised Agile / XP process but have organically
developed methods that allow us to manage development effectively. The core
values for us are true ownership for devs of their work and maximum
transparency during the planning process. We are committed to continuous
deployment, testing, refactoring, and code maintainability.

The wide salary band is an indication that we are happy to interview
candidates from a wide range of experience levels. The skills, intelligence
and enthusiasm we are looking for can be found in a new graduate who is a
passionate about the web or in a professional web developer with a few
great sites already under his or her belt.

About Nestoria:

We like to give something back to the technology communities we're involved
in, and are especially keen on contributing to the Perl (CPAN) and
Geo-spatial open source development communities. We make our API available
to developers, are frequent sponsors of relevant events and operate
#geomob, a quarterly meet up for geo and mobile enthusiasts.

We also like to give back to our team members. We invest time into
expanding our collective knowledge through attending conferences and
training days, and through our own internal tech talks where each week one
engineer presents to the team about any subject. Each developer in the team
has an annual training budget allocated to them, and is expected to search
out and suggest training opportunities. In August 2013, for example, the
entire development team attended the 3-day YAPC::EU conference in Kiev,
Ukraine.

Required skills:
Maybe you are looking to make the move to a tech team which embraces the
principles of clean code, best practice development methodologies, and
user-centred product planning. Perhaps you crave a role in a smaller,
tightly-knit team which affords you a higher degree of responsibility and a
more diverse range of juicy projects to work on. Or maybe you can't wait to
get your hands on our frontend and make it work even more smoothly in your
favourite browser on your Nexus 10.

Required skills:

•	Experience with web development including JavaScript, HTML5, and
CSS3
(we love jQuery, JSON and media queries)
•	Experience with a dynamic language such as Python, Ruby, PHP or
Perl
(we’ll teach you to write modern, readable Perl)
•	Experience developing for a Linux platform
(we’re fans of Debian and Devops)

Desired skills:
It is also desirable but not essential that you have some of the following:


•	Understanding of responsive design and cross-device website testing

•	Experience with internationalization and character encoding
•	Good understanding of test-driven development
•	Experience working with systems which have to scale to a large
number of users
