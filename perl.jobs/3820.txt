Spire Vision has an opening for a Perl developer with MySQL, Email and
Linux/Unix skills to work onsite in midtown, New York City. We're seeking a
programmer with the ability to customize and maintain large scale, open

• Unix/Linux/Open Source approach to systems deployment and software
development. 
• Proficient in Perl for both mod_perl application interface development
and backend data-processing. 
• Ability to maintain our servers (running Linux using the Apache
webserver) as well as provision new servers (you must have experience
administering servers, changing hosting companies, migrating from one
server to another, etc). 
• Experienced in HTML, Javascript, Perl, PHP, MySQL, DNS, Apache Servers
and Unix -- systems administration experience required. 
• Email processing and experience with qmail preferred, but not critical if
you’re willing to learn it. 

Desired skills:
• Email processing and experience with qmail preferred, but not critical if
you’re willing to learn it.  
Desired skills:  • Creative approach to problem solving and can-do
attitude. 
• Ability to check and troubleshoot your own work is critical. 
• Ability to interface directly with non-technical end-users. 
• Self-starter who can work independently while managing your resources to
complete tasks in a timely manner.
