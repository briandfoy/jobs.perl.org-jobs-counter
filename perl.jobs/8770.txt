Description:
Plain Black (www.plainblack.com) is looking for a Perl programming, Linux
using, ssh connected, GEEK! We're not looking for your run of the mill
programmer; only geeks should apply. We want you to know and love
technology. We want you to not only have heard of operating systems other
than Windows, but to have used them. And most importantly, we want you to
be hungry to learn more every single day. If this sounds like you, continue
reading, else go back to Monster.

On a day to day basis you'll be asked to design and build new applications
for WebGUI (www.webgui.org) and add features to existing applications.
Sometimes you'll work independently, and sometimes you'll work as part of a
team, so you must be both self-motivated and a good communicator. You'll
work with technologies such as Perl, Javascript, MySQL, Apache, and Linux.
Be prepared to think on your feet, plan ahead, and fly by the seat of your
pants...it just depends on the day.
