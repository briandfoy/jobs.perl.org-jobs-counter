Job title: Perl/Web Developer

Company name: MIS Web Design Ltd.

Location: England, United Kingdom, Yorkshire

Pay rate:
Negotiable Hourly Rate or Per Project Basis

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
I have been developing Perl applications through MIS Web Design for the
last 5 years. Specifically Content Management, eCommerce and bespoke
applications such as on-line surveys or quote generators. I have now joined
another venture which is taking up a lot of my time and I do not have the
time to do all of the Perl programming I need to do. I need some help.

I am looking for someone who I can develop a long term relationship with
developing web based applications in Perl. There is not enough work to
justify a full time position and there may be loads of work for a month or
two and then nothing for a while so I need someone who has other work on
too but can be flexible enough to fit my work in at short notice when
necessary. I will always try to give as much notice as possible.

I need someone who is local as I prefer to meet face to face to discuss
projects so it is essential that you live in Yorkshire or very near. I live
in Bradford and work in Sheffield so can easily meet up in Sheffield, Leeds
or Bradford.

I would expect you to carry out the work in your own location at present
although it may be possible to provide you with an office in Sheffield in
the future.

I hope that sums it up, please get in touch if this sounds like you and
I'll give you any further information you need.
