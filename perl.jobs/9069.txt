Job title: Remote Perl Developer (Mason, Catalyst)

Company name: Web 2.0 Art Platform

Location: United States, MA, Boston

Pay rate: Negotiable $20 - 25/hr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 - 6 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hello,

We hired a wonderful resource off this list a few months ago and have had a
tremendous experience! So now we're back for more! (If you've applied with
us before, feel free to apply again to be considered for this new opening)

We are looking for a long-term and remote (virtual team) development
resource to support additional build out of our live web 2.0 art platform.
The pay is $20 - $25.00/hr negotiable; it may seem small but, again, this
is a  long-term, remote, relationship and we're a bunch of poor start-up
geeks ourselves. So with rent, food, and drinks, these are all that we can
afford to pay someone for the time being. We're looking for time commitment
of at least 5 to 9 hrs each day 5 days a week with a commitment of at least
3 months; alternatively you can make your own schedule and work on the
weekends or late at night. We're open to any schedule so long as you
produce and meet deadlines. We're privately funded with seed money. Stock
and options are available once we have developed a proper working
relationship. 

We are looking for a trusted resource to help us smooth out rough edges on
a product that has been pushed out of Beta. You'll be working closely with
our 3-member technology and design team. We're small, unique, and informal.
Everyone pitch in to get things done as effectively and as quickly as
possible with accountability laid across the entire team. There's a lot of
excitement to our product. Each week, you'll get a project plan complete
with UI specs and full write-up. Your job will be to code out the new
functionality as outlined in the plan.

You should be available for chat and conference call during hours of work.
Please send resume and highlighted snapshot of your Perl and DB work to
chunter26 @ gmail.com 

Come and work on a product that will impact the art industry and the
millions who are connected to it from around the world!

Thanks!

Ted
