Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: BookTrolls, LLC

Location: Houston, TX, USA

Pay rate: $100,000 USD/yr

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: long-term

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is no glue-scripting position; we use Perl at a deeper level than
almost any other company.  Our entire software infrastructure is pure Perl
(under Linux), with code ranging from simple CGI scripts to
enterprise-class custom servers built from the ground up, with serious
thought given to clever algorithms and data structures.  We are quickly
building our software team as our business expands rapidly, and you'd be
getting in on the ground floor.  Both our culture and development model are
pretty informal.  We're not a software company, but our own in-house
software runs every aspect of the business.  We offer a greater degree of
creative control, project ownership, and career growth than you'll find at
most any other company. Plus you can ride the forklift.

Required skills:
5 years' experience with Perl, preferably more than just "glue" scripts;
must be thoroughly fluent

Fluent in object-oriented Perl and regular expressions

Familiarity with Perl Apache CGI scripts

Linux command line skills, including file manipulation, file editors, grep,
etc

Desired skills:
Multi-threading experience, including deadlocks, race conditions, and
apartment threads

Familiarity with BerkeleyDB, HTML, JavaScript, client/server programming,
and system-level Linux skills
