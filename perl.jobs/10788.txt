creating and driving quality build and release processes, and driving the
performance improvement of these applications. We are continuously pushing
the envelope and needing the next generation of development environment to
enable the next generation of chips. 

In this position, you will, work closely with other project members and
users to specify systems, create schedules, and manage ongoing feedback and
enhancement releases. You will be creating environments that are stable and
easy to use by hundreds of engineers worldwide. You will learn and greatly
