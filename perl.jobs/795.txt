Description:
We are looking for enthusiastic perl coder that possess good people skills.
You would be working in an ISP environment with many different internal and
external systems. You would be working with two other programmers in house.


We are not only looking for the talent in throwing some code together in a
hurry but also the careful thoughtful skills it takes to create pervasive
dependable code.

Knowledge of networks and TCP are a must. We are an Internet company after
all and everything we do touches some kind of a network at some point. 

We are primarily a UNIX shop using FreeBSD whenever we can, and in fact
most of our servers are indeed BSD but one cannot avoid working on some
Windows machines.

Good coding skills are a MUST. All code is reviewed with the idea that peer
review is generally  good.

We do not play the Salary game, this means that we pay by the hour. You
would work an eight hour day unless there is overtime and that pays time
and a half. We abide by all California labor laws and all we ask is a full
days work for a full days pay.


Required skills:
Perl, MySQL, Shell, HTML, System Administration

Desired skills:
PHP, Firewall setups (IPF),Squid,Sendmail Admin, Bind Admin, QMail Admin
