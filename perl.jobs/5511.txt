Job title: Perl XML web services

Company name: Everyone Counts Inc

Location: Australia, VIC, Melbourne

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 12 weeks

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Hi there,
We are close to negotiating a job which will require Perl people for 12
weeks to work with us from late Jan.  We need people who are comfortable
with XML web services in Perl.	 We need to have new web services developed
and glued to our existing, large code base as part of UK gov't
interoperability for what we do.  

You need to be physically in or near Melbourne, Australia and able to come
to Carlton at least some days as you will need to meet with us a fair bit
in this project.  We need you full time if not more.  You would need to be
available from the last week of Jan or very soon after.

Some of the work would be mounting Schematron and SAX services for existing
schemas but most of the work will be working to understanding what the
current system does and bridge the small and large gaps.  It's a hack, I
know, and maybe you can help us see a bit of direction, but for now, we
have to get up to speed.

Your ability to see and solve problems, understand the 80/20 rule and make
prudent use of Perl and CPAN under what may be fairly pressing timelines
would be greatly appreciated.  Any experience with similar projects would
be good as would knowledge of UK eGIF and our stack of Apache, mod_perl,
MySQL, Debian.	

You have to be insured and registered for Aust GST.  You need your own
laptop and Internet access.  You need to agree to an Aust Federal Police
check and you can't be a member of any political party.  

Please only apply if you can physically attend Carlton, VIC, Australia or
are willing to meatcommute.


Required skills:
Perl, XML, Apache mod_perl, MySQL


Desired skills:
Efficient problem solving with legacy codebases (patience)
Internet security, "web development"
