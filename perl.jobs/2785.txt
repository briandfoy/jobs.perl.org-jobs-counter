explained so that others based on common sense

wear several hats at times and be involved from analysis and design through
testing, implementation and support of live systems.

especially in Oracle/MySQL is desirable.  Applicants must be
self-motivated, organized, able to communicate with internal clients, and
have the ability to both complete projects independently as well as work on
small teams.
