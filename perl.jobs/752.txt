Job title: PERL Programmer, NOT a web developer

Company name: Drexel Technical, Inc.

Internal ID: MMPERL

Location: United States, NJ, Piscataway

Pay rate: $75-80K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: PERM

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Position is full-time, direct with client, and is located in Piscataway, NJ
area. 
Require an experienced Perl Programmer with networking background (TCP/IP).
Want someone who loves to code and has a solid software development
background. Majority of experience is programming (Perl and C required) on
Linux platform. Must take Perl 5 developer Fundamentals test and score in
the 90th Percentile or better. A great plus would be to have experience
with development of a networking product, though not required. Interaction
with common Linux services (LDAP, IP cables, security).


Required skills:
Required skills:  Majority of experience is programming (Perl required,
some C) on Linux platform. NO systems administrators - client requires a
programmer! But do not want a database programmer who wrote Perl scripts to
talk to database 90% of the time.
UNIX/TCPIP networking experience is a must.
At least a BS in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science. 
The right person will have good experience with networking and Perl
development skills of underlying networks, not just web sites. 
Successful candidates will have experience that goes beyond database or
application server work. Basically, for the past 3-4 years, many developers
went into web development; they require more than that. People who built
sites that spoke with database or have skills like Web Logic are probably
not a good fit. 
LDAP, PAM, SAMBA, ipchains.


Desired skills:
Desired skills:  Some C++ is helpful. 
Socket programming experience is a major plus. 
Successful candidate will have between 7 and 10 years of programming
experience. 
Local candidates preferred.
