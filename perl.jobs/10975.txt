Job title:
Quick email grabber script and email sender script (can use CPAN)

Company name: Independent/start-up

Location: United States, New York, New York

Pay rate: 210

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Description:
Hi! We are looking for someone knowledgeable in MIME header parsing and
pop3/smtp in general to write two scripts in Perl. The operating system we
are using is Debian Linux.

1. A message grabber script that will download e-mails from a Gmail inbox
or a Hotmail inbox using pop3 and put each message in a directory called
/tmp/messages/(unique message no.)/

The e-mail body should be in /tmp/messages/(unique message
no.)/message.html and only contain valid HTML. No content-header/MIME
base64-encoded attachments soup!

The e-mail subject should in /tmp/messages/(unique message no.)/subject.txt


The e-mail &amp;amp;quot;From&amp;amp;quot; address should be in
/tmp/messages/(unique message no.)/from.txt

The e-mail sender's name (from the From header) should be in
/tmp/messages/(unique message no.)/fromname.txt

All attachments of the e-mail should be in /tmp/messages/(unique message
no.)/attachments/(whatever the name of the attachment is)

The script will accept these command-line arguments: 1. The inbox e-mail
address
2. The inbox password
3. That's it.

Your script will store the settings (name of server, whether to use SSL,
and port) for the two most popular e-mail providers (Gmail and Hotmail) in
an array at the top of the script.

Based on the domain name in the e-mail address supplied, your program will
select the appropriate settings.

2. You will build an e-mail sender script that will use SMTP to send an
e-mail from the user's Gmail or Hotmail account.

The sender script will accept the following parameters: The e-mail address
of the SMTP box, the account password, the address of the e-mail address
recipient, a string with the message subject, and a string with the message
body (passed to the script as quoted command-line arguments).

I will supply you with a Perl script called grabber_pop3.pl that has a
subset of this functionality (it grabs messages over pop3, but only parses
the From/Subject headers and doesn't handle attachments).

Feel free to use any CPAN modules you want for these two scripts. 

Required skills: Knowledge of Perl and pop3/smtp.
