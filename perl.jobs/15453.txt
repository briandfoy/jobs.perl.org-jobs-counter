Job title: Perl Programmer

Company name: Pobox

Location: Philadelphia, PA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
# We're hiring!

We are Pobox.  (We are also Listbox. (We're actually a
wholly-owned operation
of FastMail, too.))  We've been around since before
the Internet was cool,
offering all kinds of email-related services.

We're
a small company located in center city Philadelphia.  You don't need to
be
in Philadelphia all the time, but expect to come to the office a couple
times a week.  We like hashing things out in person.

We also like free
software; it runs our business. As much as possible, we try to
write our
code so that we can release it — it's easier to write good code when 
you
know other people will see it.	Our employees have included and continue
to
include active free software community leaders and frequent conference 
speakers.

Feel free to sign up for a trial account of either service to
see more about
what we do.

email addresses
* Listbox - https://listbox.com/ - mailing lists
* FastMail
- https://fastmail.fm/ - hosted email

You won't be working primarily on
these, though.	We're working on some
new stuff, and you'll be getting in
on the ground floor.  (Don't panic:
we'll totally let you do maintenance
work on the scary old code, too!)

Desired skills:
# Who are we hiring?

We're hiring a programmer.  You should definitely
know how to program.

We're looking for an experienced programmer.  You
don't need to be an expert
at everything, but this isn't a good place to
start your first programming gig.
You should be able to implement to a
specification, write a decent test suite,
debug somebody else's code, and
document things in a way that other people can
understand a year later.
You'll be working with other experienced programmers,
debugging their code,
and reading their documentation.  The circle of life!

Ideally, you should
know Perl 5 — you're quite proficient in
it, and up to date on some of the
popular foundation libraries like Moose,
Plack, and DBIx::Class.  If you're
a Perl rookie with this level of experience
in a comparable language and a
stomach for all of Perl's squiggly braces and
dollar signs, that's cool,
too.  If you're interested, let's talk!

It would be pretty great if you
were already proficient with PostgreSQL and/or
MySQL.	("and," here, is of
course better than "or!")  Knowing Postfix pretty
well would be valuable. 
If you remember how to write Mason, that could pay
off.  Having git
superpowers will earn you extra high fives.

If you've got DTrace, Chef, or
Joyent Triton under your belt, we'll put a
little gold star on your résumé.
 If you don't, that's okay, too.

# What's the job?

Mostly, new
development.  In this, there's a bunch of Perl talking to
PostgreSQL, some
email stuff with Postfix, a bunch of web service code using 
Plack, and
it's tied together with introspection of classes to automatically
generate
the web interfaces.  The code has not yet become an awful
ball of yarn.

Some of it is maintenance: we have a big code base written across many
years.
Most of this code Just Works, so there isn't a lot of ongoing
maintenance
needed, but it comes up, and — lucky you! — you'll get to do
some of it!

Here's an unordered list of some of the things you'd be
working with:

  * Moose
  * Postfix
  * DBIx::Class
  * PostgreSQL
  *
MySQL
  * Git
  * Rx Schema
  * SQLite
  * Australians
  * Cyrus
  *
Moonpig
  * Joyent Triton (Solaris[h])
  * Crazy in-house ORM from 1999
  *
Chef
