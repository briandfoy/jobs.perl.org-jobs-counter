Job title: Perl Hacker

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Location: Somerville, MA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for a software engineer to help us enhance and refine our
products, and as well as to be excellent to our customers. You'll be
responsible for everything from implementing new features, to testing and
applying user-contributed patches to our released software. In a typical
week, you'll probably spend about half your time working on internal and
open source projects, and half working on customer projects; this requires
good communication skills, as well as a desire to help customers get the
most out of our software.

The hours are fairly flexible, and we all telecommute some of the
time...though we work from our office in the heart of Davis Square,
Somerville on most days. While we do a fair amount of our collaboration
in-person, you should also be comfortable using email and instant messaging
to coordinate and get work done, as we have a few employees in other parts
of the globe.

Required skills:
You should be a self-starter who either has solid experience with Perl, or
significant experience with similarly-flavored languages (Python, Ruby,
etc) and a willingness to pick up Perl quickly. Some experience with at
least a few of the following buzzwords is also desirable:

Open source development practices (code review, backcompat)
Distributed source control (git, branching, patches)
Test driven development (smoke testing, Test::More)
User interface design (HTML, CSS)
Documentation (user-facing, API)
Javascript (jQuery, AJAX)
SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite)
Optimization, profiling, and debugging (nytprof)
UNIX systems administration (webservers, mailservers)
It's okay if you don't know everything out of the gate, but you should be
able to learn on the fly and be comfortable asking questions when you get
in over your head. RT is a large codebase to dive into, so you should be
prepared to work with a project that's too big to hold in your head all at
once. If you want to see what sort of trouble you're getting yourself into,
you can find all of our open source code on github.

Desired skills:
We're a small company; you should be comfortable working both independently
and in small teams, and prioritizing tasks on your own. Being able to
task-switch efficiently and juggle several projects at once is a necessity.
