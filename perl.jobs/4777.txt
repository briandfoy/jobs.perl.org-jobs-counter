JOB DESCRIPTION - PROGRAMMER/ANALYST (TELECOMMUTING)

goal-oriented, self-starting individuals, with a good sense of humor, who
can work from home as part of a team in a virtual environment.

including MySQL, LDAP and others; a strong working knowledge of HTML and
XML development; and comfort working in a UNIX ( Linux and FreeBSD
environment ) development environment with source control tools such as SVN
and CVS.  

Outstanding candidates will have knowledge and experience working with VBA
(Access), .NET and flash development, as well as system administration and
security management skills for the UNIX and/or Windows operating systems. 

Individuals selected for the position will be required to provide their own
secure computer, basic software and high speed internet access.  A great
majority of this work can be done remotely from any location.

Candidates will be required to submit examples of their work.  We look
forward to interviewing and working with capable candidates.

About Us:
Crystal Solutions, LLC is a small, privately owned company that provides a
variety of IT services to both government and commercial sectors. Our ever
expanding clientele base includes small businesses, large corporations,
non-profit organizations, and U.S. government and military operations.

Based in Newport News, Virginia, Crystal Solutions, LLC has a highly
qualified staff that can provide an onsite presence or work remotely to

developing high level efficiency tools for companies wishing to streamline

types of clients.
