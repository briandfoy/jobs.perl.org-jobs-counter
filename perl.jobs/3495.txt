Job title:
Volenteer with a passion for documentary film

Company name: e screening room

Location: United States, CA, San Rafael

Pay rate: Volenteer

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Perl
Wanted Volunteer Perl, CGI PHP MYSQL programmer with a passion for
documentary films.

We are looking for a volunteer with a passion for documentary films and in
support of the freedom of speech, with experience with Perl, some MySQL /
SQL and some experience with cgi would come in handy. We are using agile
programming methods or exstreem programming.. We can’t pay you anything but
you get to help create a cool site for your resume and we will mail
shade-grown coffee to keep you going. Expect to volunteer about 4 hour a
week consistently for this project

The non-profit e screening room http://escreeningroom.org/ is creating a
platform for documentary film makers and their audience. Documentary film
fans can watch full length unabridged films. If they like what they see
they can buy a DVD copy for home viewing. The e screening room is created
by an international group of volunteers with a passion for documentary
films. 

The e screening room is dedicated to create a different distribution
channel for documentary producers. Independent documentaries are born out
of the passion –often compassion - for the subject of the documentary.
Often these documentaries are self financed.  But there is little financial
gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get
discouraged and often leave the field. We think that’s a shame: to lose an
independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we
are changing that by creating a new distribution channel for documentary
film.

Scoop:
We have a module called submit.cgi which allows producers to create an
account and submit their film. We need to expand on this module to allow a
second film to be submit for the same producer. You can see the module
http://escreeningroom.org/submit.cgi.

We meet by phone usually 2 a month. 

Responsibilities. 
 The responsibilities of the Mambo Specialist include, but are not
necessary limited to: 
 - Expanding on the submit.cgi module
 - Integrating with the dpfmanager
 - Documenting the development in our wiki. 
 - Reporting weekly progress and hours worked.
 - Managing additional volunteers as needed. 

 Qualifications. 
 - Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in a bachelors program. 
 - Solid commitment put in a minimum 4 hr per week for 2 months. 
 - Fundamental project management knowledge. 
 - Strong communication, and organizational skills. 
 - Able to follow through and meet deadlines. 
 - Able to work independently

To apply send us 
1) Why you are interested in documentary films.
2) At least one link to a website that shows you skills and explain what
part you created. 
3) At least two references. 
4) Your contact info. 

This is a voluntary position, for a cool site.

If this is something you feel as passionate about as we do, please send me
a few lines about your experience to:
