Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Circonus, Inc.

Location: Remote Or Fulton, Maryland

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Circonus is a software company that is changing the way the world monitors
both IT infrastructure and businesses it powers. Our SaaS and on-premise
solutions enable companies to navigate the torrent of telemetry data
produced by technology enabled businesses, turn that data into information
and leverage it all to make better and faster decisions. 

Circonus
operations team members focus on operating high performance, resilient
systems to power telemetry analysis systems around the globe. As a Perl
Developer you will be working inside the software engineering group in a
DevOps culture -- though you're unlikely to hear that word on the job.

About the Job
* Finding website bottlenecks and improving website
performance, both up and down the stack
* Building back-end systems,
internal support, and business communications tools
* Implementing customer
requests including API features and tools requests
* Scaling data, web
systems and automating as much as possible
* Identifying and solving
software errors
* Improving deployment, monitoring, and operability in
everything you do

Required skills:
* 1-2 years experience with Perl
* Working knowledge of mod_Perl
*
Familiarity with Apache Web Server
* Understanding of Unix-based software
development environments
* Familiarity with a DBMS (postgres preferred)
*
Understanding of message queues
* Fluency in one or more version control
systems
* Experience with node.js or 1-2 scripting languages a plus
* You
are great at solving problems and not afraid to initiate solutions and
discussions
* You are a self-starter, independent worker and like to work
in teams

Desired skills:
If you've read the book "Web Operations" and were inspired by the first
chapter about careers... just remember Theo Schlossnagle founded Circonus.
If you contribute to an open source project, write a blog, or are involved
in technology in some other way, we would love to hear about it when you
apply!
