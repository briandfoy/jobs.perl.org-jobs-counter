Job title: Senior Perl Developer for geizhals.net

Company name: Preisvergleich Internet Services AG

Location: AUSTRIA, Vienna, Vienna

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Preisvergleich Internet Services AG is the company behind
http://geizhals.net/, one of the leading online Price-comparison websites
in the german language area.

We are looking for a german-speaking Perl Developer (m/f) for permanent
employment.

We're offering good coffee, softdrinks, an airconditioned office in 1020
Vienna, a successful business, like-minded admins and developers and an
abundance of existing and yet to be written Perl code.

Required skills:
publish(@$_) for (
  map { [ @{$_}{qw(price stuff)} , more_info($_->{id}) ] }
  sort { $a->{price} <=> $b->{price} }
  grep { $_->{stuff} =~ /^cool/i }
  @{$geizhals{data}}
);

If you 

- understand this code
- can tell us what could be improved
- have a better version which is more pretty but not noticeably longer

we'd be delighted to see it attached to your application and are looking
forward to meet you in person.

Desired skills:
Besides Perl and mod_perl we're using Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL and common
Open Source tools like ssh, rsync, RCS, etc.
