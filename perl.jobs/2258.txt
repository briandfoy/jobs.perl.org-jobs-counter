Description:
Foxtons Estate Agent is looking for an enthusiastic and motivated Web

You will have experience of developing web based projects and have tried
and tested experience solving problems and providing solutions. Ideally you
will have 1-3 years' work experience to demonstrate these skills, however,
exceptional candidates with less experience will be considered. You must be

projects and processes as well as being self motivated and able to work
alone. 

It is essential that you have experience of Perl and SQL as well as
knowledge of CPAN. 

Desired skills:
Ideally you will also have familiarity with some or all of the following:
OO Perl, Mod_perl, HTTP and other internet protocols, XML, Linux (Debian),
