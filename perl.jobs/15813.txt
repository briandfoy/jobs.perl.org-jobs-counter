Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Textkernel

Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are currently looking for an experienced Perl developer to join
Textkernel’s Research & Development team. You will contribute to our
machine learning framework and improve the models that power two of our
main products: Extract! (CV parsing) and Jobfeed (job ad parsing).


Products you’ll be working on

Through our Extract! product we process
millions of CVs and jobs every month – both as a SaaS solution and as an
on-premise installation. It covers 17 languages and is engineered to deal
with the diversity of candidate profiles and job ads. Jobfeed, our big data
labor market tool, enables our clients from the HR and recruitment world to
generate leads and develop their business.


Your responsibilities

You
will drive the effort of improving our machine learning framework. On a
daily basis you will work closely with our R&D engineers to develop new
features, integrate new machine learning packages and improve our
evaluation and testing tools. You will also collaborate with our DevOps
team to improve the deployment and scalability of our parsing services.
Being an Agile advocate you’ll take an active part in our code reviews,
collaborate on design and implementation and work towards continuous
integration and deployment. This is also a great opportunity to learn about
complex machine learning and natural language processing systems.

Desired skills:
* You have extensive knowledge of modern Perl, its module ecosystem and OOP
* You can develop and maintain production level applications on both Linux
and Windows
* You have developed modern API endpoints
* You have an
interest in web development (e.g. Mojolicious, AngularJS ) and NoSQL
database (e.g. MongoDB)
* Good knowledge of algorithms and datastructures
