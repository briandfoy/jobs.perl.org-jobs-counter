Job title: Freelance programmer in the Netherlands

Company name: Oakbox Productions

Location: Netherlands, Breda

Pay rate: 45 Euros per hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
I am an independent contractor based in the Netherlands.      Mostly I deal
with psychological testing systems for several clients.  As each system has
grown, each client is asking for more and more complex feature sets, and
I'm falling behind.  I need two more freelance programmers to work with on
these projects and the clients want to warm fuzzy feeling that comes from
having a second phone number to call if their site starts acting up.  

I am looking for:
 - An independent contractor, je moet en BTW nummer hebben.  You will spend
some time getting familiar with the codebase, meet with the client, and be
available for support issues if I am not available.  Basically, I want
someone who is a freelancer like me who has some space in their schedule to
pick up some extra work.  
 - Someone fluent in Nederlands.  This is a REQUIREMENT, please do not
respond if you are not fluent in Dutch.
 - Someone located IN the Netherlands.	On occasion, my clients want to
meet with the people doing the programming face to face.


Required skills:
Perl
use strict;
use warnings;
OO experience
MySQL
Linux
Subversion is used for version control!


Desired skills:
My code is straightforward and easy to understand.  Not a lot of 'map'ping
going on.  Readability and Useability are the most important things to me
and my clients.

A basic understanding of Statistics is a plus, but not a requirment.  My
clients require a nondisclosure agreement.
