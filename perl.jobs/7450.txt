Job title:
Perl Developer for Fixed Income Trading Applications (mod_perl, DBI, etc.)

Company name: TheMuniCenter

Internal ID: Perl2007

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: Open

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
TMC creates an optimized fixed income marketplace by blending electronic
trading with voice brokerage and cutting-edge tools for traders and
advisors. TMC offers commingled dealer and buy-side inventory from hundreds
of anonymous liquidity providers. Live inventory is comprised of over
30,000 daily taxable and tax-exempt line items averaging $17 billion par
value. For municipal bonds alone, we have considerably more unique content
than other leading alternative platforms. TMC's current executable
inventory includes Agencies, Corporates, CDs, MTNs, Municipals, Structured
Products and Treasuries. This year, TMC is expanding into Auction Rates,
CMOs, and Whole Loans.

Co-founded in 2000 by "major" Wall Street firms, TMC offers the industry's
premier live, two-sided (i.e., bid and offer), and executable marketplace
for both odd-lot and round-lot trades. Electronic trading is complemented
by a fully staffed Voice Brokerage Desk. Each broker averages 18 years of
experience. Since TMC is your trading counterparty, we can assist with any
settlement questions. This eliminates handling credit and clearing details
with potentially hundreds of counterparties-a major drawback of "fully
disclosed" competitor platforms.

The main focus of this position is to support the development of our Broker
Workstation product. We service our client firms by developing customized
private-label websites. This position will be involved in all phases of
application development. You must be flexible, dedicated, and a team
player!

Trading hours are from 8 AM to 5 PM; candidate must be available during
these hours, as well as the occasional after-hours work involved in
software releases. Also, as part of the nature of a small company,
candidates will be expected to "wear multiple hats", and will be working on
a variety of projects. Every day presents new challenges, and each member
of our team is exposed to all aspects of the business… you will not be
pigeonholed here! We seek people who think creatively and find solutions
where others would merely panic.

We offer an exciting, casual work environment dedicated to delivering real
results in aggressive time frames. We are offering very competitive
salaries to the right candidates. TMC has a comprehensive benefits package. 

Required skills:
TheMuniCenter seeks a talented, thorough, highly communicative application
developer with about 3+ years experience in Perl and the following skills:

    * Perl development in large, complex applications with many modules
    * mod_perl development is a plus
    * solid understanding of SQL and database programming (via DBI)
    * experience with Sybase is a plus
    * familiarity with CSS, DHTML, JavaScript
    * good visual design skills are a plus
    * CVS and other source code management and build tools
    * ability to keep track of several projects at once
    * ability to work under time pressure and respond to changes
    * clear, well documented coding style
    * high intelligence and strong analytical problem-solving abilities
    * good written communication skills
    * a solid understanding of regular expressions and their usage
    * an ability to coordinate and communicate with clients on both a
technical
    * support and development/integration capacity 

Financial industry experience is not required. Any experience with Java,
PHP, or financial trading systems would be a definite plus.
