Job title: Senior Level Perl Programmer - Telecommute $135k

Company name: CBN LLC

Location: United States, Nevada, Las Vegas

Pay rate: $100,000-$135,000

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2-7 Years

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:

We need a confident perl programmer to help us expand our operations
throughtout the world.

The code base is currently approximately 12,000 lines of perl, in addition
to some test code, and documentation. It uses gearman to manage several
workers that hit various APIs and perform some screen scraping to interact
with our vendors and storefronts. There is also a small, but growing
internal web-based administrative interface.  It's written in rather modern
perl, making use of modules such as DBIx::Class, WWW::Mechanize, Plack, and
some Moose. It runs on a rather large PostgreSQL database, so a working
knowledge of PostgreSQL and how to tune it would be very useful.

Our team is quite small, so you would be expected to fill several roles in
addition to perl programming. You would perform some linux system
administration and database administration in addition to the typical
administrative work associated with managing your own part of a software
project. We're spread out around the country, so we communicate through
email, phone, and text messages.

The ideal candidate will have extensive perl programming experience, not
only on web-based systems but also on stand-alone applications. Much of the
code runs outside of a webserver. You will have worked alone or as a senior
member of a significant programming project so that you're comfortable
working from a specification, estimating the time required for a task,
reporting on progress periodically, and delivering tested, usable code.

Since much of the work will be in adapting a current system to interact
with some new vendors and sites, you must be willing to work with an
existing code base. You will tailor it to work for the new markets while
allowing its current use.

You will also be responsible for the operation of the code, so ability to
occasionally respond to urgent matters off-hours is necessary. You may also
occasionally interact with customers or vendors.


Required skills:
* use of "Modern Perl" tools like DBIx::Class and Moose
* writing test code for perl
* history of working with XML or JSON APIs

Desired skills:
* writing gearman bots
* linux system administration
* Amazon API knowledge
* WWW::Mechanize
* PostgreSQL administration
* git
