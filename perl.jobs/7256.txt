Job title:
Perl, Perl and more Perl - True commercial development - Relo/Sponsorship -
New York City

Company name: GridApp Systems, Inc.

Internal ID: Perl.org GA 709

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: Very competitive salary

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
THE POSITION – You are currently a mid to senior level developer (if you’re
just 1-2 years into Perl development, please contact us as well) with at
least 5 years of Perl development experience; you travel to and from all
the Perl websites, PM user groups, and open source associations like the
streets of your home town. You most likely have experience in other forms
of object oriented development.

**Offer significant abilities with Perl (more than just CGI) with PHP and
C++ experience a plus
**Have solid experience in TCP/IP network and/or distributed systems
programming
**Are working with one or more of these databases - Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL

**Are very comfortable with Linux (and ideally UNIX as well)

THE COMPANY– GridApp Systems is a leader in database automation and
management. Our Clarity™ software and D2500 database appliance provide
companies with the ability to simplify and manage critical database
operational tasks such as deployment, patch management, auditing, and
replication across the enterprise. The company is privately held and
headquartered in New York City. For more information, visit
www.gridapp.com.

THE WORK ENVIRONMENT– Located in the Flatiron District of New York, easily
accessible from many directions, our mission is to transform the way
organizations manage their database infrastructure through the use of
automation. This is not a 24/7 position; camp-out under your desk type of
environment; you’re with others who love Perl and open source. Naturally,
there may be times when you have to put in the hours but you won’t
regularly be calling in for pizza delivery at 4:00 AM. Our development team
is top shelf with a myriad of personal interests that always seem to find
their way into our daily activities. In a nutshell, it’s programmer casual
with a company that was created by developers.

And if you do work at GridApp Systems, you will be well paid, will receive
benefits and stock options, and unlike quite a few companies these days, we
also provide relocation money for stellar candidates as well as
sponsorships and transfer visas as needed.

So come visit our website and see for yourself how our products help
companies manage their data resources smarter. Read the GridApp blog
(http://blog.gridapp.com) and leaf through the great industry, systems,
development, and career resources we’re assembling for you.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT– After you send us your resume
(techjobs@gridapp.com), you will receive a notification of your status
within 24 hours. If our team feels your experience meets our immediate and
longer term needs, we’ll call you for a phone screen; if all goes well,
it's time for the code test.

THERE ARE OTHER POSITIONS AVAILABLE – in QA, sysadmin, sales engineering,
and sales. Click here to go to our jobs page - you may have a friend who is
a perfect fit!

“What is the sound of Perl? Is it not the sound of a wall that people have
