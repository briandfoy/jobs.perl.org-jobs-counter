Job title:
Perl Developer for Unique Toronto Tech Company

Company name: OANDA

Location: Canada, Ontario, Toronto

Pay rate: Commensurate on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Why OANDA?

It’s really pretty simple.  OANDA is a unique company.	It's not a Web
upstart or a bank.  It’s a technology company that innovates both in
computer engineering and financial modelling for the Foreign Currency
Exchange Trade market. 

OANDA has experienced continued growth since its founding in 1996, and
opportunities for employees are unprecedented as the company creates new
products that redefine the forex market.  With a daily capitalization of $3
trillion, the forex market dwarfs both the US bond and equity markets. 

What's at the root of OANDA's success?	A culture of transparency and
openness, and  a continued focus on constantly developing innovative
technology.  At OANDA, you will work under the leadership of computer
science and economics experts in an almost lab-like environment.  You will
develop and challenge your skills every day.  You will have the ability to
be self-directed in your work within a collaborative team structure. 
You’ll enjoy the immediacy of a small company, but use the most advanced
tools/technologies that a large firm can offer.  And to maintain that
community feel at OANDA we offer flexibility & sociability with things like
a concierge service, on-site massage therapist, weekly Wed lunch, Friday @
4 gatherings and more.	You will contribute to the growth and direction of
OANDA, and your contributions to the success of the company will be
recognized and rewarded. 

Located in downtown Toronto, the OANDA development office provides
convenient access to public transit and other downtown amenities.  

The Perl Developer:

Perl Developers are critical to OANDA’s business success as a software
company; our products are only as good as the people who create them.  With
that in mind, OANDA looks for highly intelligent, innovative, and dedicated
technology professionals.

Working within a Linux / Solaris environment, the Perl Developer will
research, design, test, implement, and maintain online and back end trading
and data services infrastructure applications.	The successful candidate
will work closely with OANDA’s technical leadership to understand business
requirements, and will collaborate with development team members to design
and write applications systems and programs.  S/he will participate in
project management and will contribute to the architecture and design
process of the Internet site.  S/he will test and debug applications to
ensure proper performance, and will be responsible for developing/modifying
program documentation. The Perl Developer will also develop an extensive
knowledge of OANDA’s computing	and business environment.


Required skills:
- At least 2 years of professional working experience in a software
engineering role. (Industry experience in the foreign exchange, financial
services, or other industry with high transaction volumes is preferred.)
- A University degree in computer science, computer engineering, or a
related field.	A graduate degree would be an asset.
- Solid development experience using Perl and mod Perl.
- Experience with UNIX / Linux / Solaris operating systems.
- Relevant experience in the development of Internet-ready applications
programs using Internet communications protocols (TCP/IP).
- Proven ability to innovate in ways that contribute to the success of the
business.
- A strong team orientation combined with the drive and ability to
contribute at the individual level.
- Exceptional communications skills – both oral and written.

Desired skills:
- Database programming experience (preferably in DB2 and MySQL).
- Knowledge of trading protocols such as FIX, CMS, etc. would be a bonus.
