Description:
I have a custom script that needs reworking for security reasons.  The vast

originally designed to be automatic, but now I need parts of it to be
manual.  The mysql database is already there, all of the code is already
there, I just need parts of it moved around to post data to various tables
in a different way.  I have a basic form already designed, I need a
programmer to write the code that will send the data from the form to the
database.  The rest of the script should remain on automatic, but it is not
currently working 100% and I need someone to fix it.  The auto part of the
script deals with the egold sci script.

perl (please know your perl!) some cgi, html and php

familiar with perl then you should have no problems with it.  i do not have
time to learn it right now.  i would like to be able to have contact
information if i need you in the future.  if you can do this then please
send me your rates and desired method of payment.  i have never minded
paying for a job well done.
