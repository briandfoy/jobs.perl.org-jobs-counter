Job title: General perl programmer for on-line tools

Company name: United States Racquet Stringers Association

Location: United States, CA, Vista

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
The company I work for is in need of a perl expert. We've never hired an
outside programmer, so I'm not certain what the best approach is for us,
but if you're a perl whiz and have the time and knowledge to help us touch
up our legacy code and add some new functionality with new code, please
contact me. I don't know exactly what's required, so we'll have to work out
the pay rate and/or contract value.

Required skills: perl

Desired skills:
perl security, password protection of areas of the site
