Description:
Ezead needs to be an easy to use well branded E-commerce Portal providing
innovative solutions for not only the Auction and Online Trading community
but a site that all can use whether they are looking within their city -
their state - their country or globally. Not Known only to a niche auction
and trading community but is seeking to become a redefined online presence
and identity - to promote the company's unique approach and vision to a
global audience. Additionally, Ezead would like to promote additional
capabilities including print(coupon specials) and interactive identity
campaigns. The existing web site is a basic layout site with outdated
content and technologies that I have built in my spare time. Immediate
goals include advancing marketing and promotion of the company via all the
search engines, and by promoting user to user communication(in other words
make it easy and sensible that our members will want to promote the
site).In order to further promote the site and supply local support and
local help to offer a affiliate program for both Ezeauction Franchisees and
Toolsntoys.Com but also A City by City Ezead Franchised Affiliate 

An excellent place to begin is to take a good look at the Ezead Advantage
it puts forth a lot of my thought and items I feel are essential in the
site. 



Platform:

The site needs to integrate with a single database system? The database
MYSQL is currently being used?
Is it best or do we have to look at other options? 

This gives you a basic outline of what is required - if you feel that you
are up to the challenge and want to further pursue this please email me
with a company resume so we can further discuss options - your
recommendations. At which point I will forward a total wish list of items
that need to be addressed and give access to the present code which has
been set up on a secondary server!! 

Thanks and Regards
Frank Rayner 


Required skills:
Perl and ability to go through and cleanup my code - complete all functions
and streamline the look and feel of the site. Revamp the site both
functionally and cosmetically to appeal to all.

Desired skills:
A team of professionals that can take on the project that I have started
and make it world class - I have total outline available in zip files that
can be forwarded to qualified individuals or teams.
