multi-task are a must. 

This position lends itself most to the technical savvy, research oriented
developer who has a solid grasp of software programming languages, n-tier
applications and especially Oracle database development.
Projects vary from external web-site development to internal tools. This
position requires solid coding experience on platform and a proven track
record of developing complex, web-based applications in an n-tier
architectural environment. A qualified candidate must have mastery of
Oracle, SQL, PL/SQL, Perl, and C.
