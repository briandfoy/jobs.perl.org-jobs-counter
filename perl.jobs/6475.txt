Job title:
Senior Perl Programmer wanted for (buzzword warning) Web 2.0 Startup

Company name: Somewhere Inc.

Internal ID: perljobs01

Location: United States, MA, Winchester

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Somewhere, Inc. is looking for a senior Perl programmer. Standard
Linux/Apache/MySQL environment. We're looking for someone who has
experience designing and developing object-oriented systems (in any
language). Someone who can come up with an architecture, defend the
decisions made, and then make it happen. Who knows how to architect for the
future, but develop for today. And who can deal when we suddenly have to
throw the architecture out the window and just get the product out the door
as fast as possible. In other words, someone who works in the real world. 

We'd prefer someone in the Boston area, but remote development is a
possibility given the right person. 

This is a full-time position with salary and equity compensation. We can
entertain starting it off part-time, but we are not looking for a
consultant. Compensation may vary depending on whether you join prior to
our first investment round. 

For what it's worth, we develop on Macs. 

As to what we are doing; here's the quick summary. 

Somewhere is transforming your old static address book into a dynamic
display of what your friends and colleagues are actually doing online right
now. Our goal is to make it easier for people to stay in touch, even as
their online presences are dispersed across a growing number of services
and networks.

If you want the really short buzzword summary, you could call us a "People
Aggregator", a "Social Networking Address Book", or more obscurely, a maker
of "Mediatronic Victorian Calling Cards". 


Required skills:
Perl, *ix, Object Oriented Design, SQL Database, Web Development.

Desired skills:
Experience with AJAX development a plus. Experience with Prototype,
Catalyst, Embperl, Template::Toolkit or other similar libraries also a
plus.
