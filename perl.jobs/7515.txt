Job title:
Software Engineer for Interactive Promotions Agency

Company name: ePrize

Location: United States, Michigan, Pleasant Ridge

Pay rate: VERY Competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Did you use SOAP today?  We did!  Along with Perl, Java, JavaScript, XML,
XSLT, XML-RPC, Web Services, and Flash.  Technology is always changing, and
so is ePrize.  We’re looking for a software developer who’s on top of it
all to deliver reliable software – on time and on budget. If you are the
go-to person relied upon to get it done when it absolutely, positively,
must be done right, we want to talk to you.  Especially if you smell
Rainforest Clean.

We are in search of Software Developers to join our team in Pleasant Ridge,
Michigan. As an ePrize software professional, you will bring rock star
capabilities to our delivery teams. Our developers design, code, test,
document, and support the ePrize technologies that drive our business.
ePrize software professionals command a challenging and non-traditional
position that demands a broad scope of knowledge and a high degree of
individual responsibility.  Enthusiasm for learning, aptitude for creative
problem solving, and a team oriented personality are key traits of a
successful ePrizer.

Required skills:
Our developers are responsible for owning and delivering on all aspects of
our technology projects. Exceptional critical analysis skills, a talent for
understanding big picture concepts, and the motivation to independently
contribute to the unlimited success of your team goes without saying.
Loving what you do is non-negotiable. Daily responsibilities include:

•	Delivering reliable software that delights the customer, on time
and on budget.
•	Contributing in a substantive way to our proprietary Toybox
Software.
•	Defining and executing on improvements to our software development
processes, habits, and techniques.
•	Communicating effectively to Project Managers, Clients, and other
audiences of all technical levels in a team environment.
•	Internalizing new technologies and procedures and applying that
knowledge to ePrize business needs.


Desired skills:
Technology is always changing and so are we. We currently use Perl, Java,
JavaScript, XML, XSLT, SOAP, XML-RPC, Web Services, and Flash. However,
ePrize software professionals are not hired based on their current skill
set but on their proven ability to master the technologies and practices
necessary to over deliver success. If you are that go-to person relied upon
to get it done when it absolutely, positively, must be done right, we want
to talk to you. Helpful experience and knowledge include:

•	Extensive experience with Linux, and Object Oriented Perl
•	Incredible coding skills in a modern programming language
•	Extensive practical knowledge of web-related concepts and
technologies
•	Practical experience in object oriented concepts and technologies
•	Practical experience and a belief in agile concepts such as test
driven development, iterative development, pair programming, and continuous
feedback
•	Relational database programming and design
•	Bachelor’s Degree or equlalivant work experience
•	Excellent command of written and spoken English
