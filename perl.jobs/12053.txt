Job title: Advanced Automation Developer (Perl)

Company name: Nimble Storage

Location: San Jose, CA

Pay rate: market rate

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have a job opening at Nimble Storage that requires advanced Perl skills.


About the job:
We are developing a test automation framework for our storage arrays.
The framework will abstract from storage appliance and client concepts, and
generally allow test case developers to create complex automated tests. We
are looking for senior-level developers who can write clean, maintainable,
object oriented code. Ideally in Perl, but
we will consider experience in comparable technologies. If you are
intimately familiar with modern Perl, you will enjoy this. We also have
parts of the product code and support web site in Perl.
Some of the technologies used/considered: Moose, Rose::DB,
Mojolicious, Log4perl, Perl 5.14, etc...
But since it is a startup, you will get deep exposure to a lot of
other technologies.

the storage business. We are growing rapidly due to a great product
line that sells like crazy.

North San Jose. Despite being a startup, we have solid financing for many
years to come, and great revenue growth.
