Job title:
activestate/Win32 + linux, perl + wxWindows + TCP/IP sockets(POP+SMTP
proxy) new antispam application. telecommute posn.

Company name: spamzap.com

Internal ID: 1

Location: Telecommute, Telecommute, Telecommute

Pay rate: quote me

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: indefinite adhoc

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Deliverables:
A) setup_win.exe
B) setup_lin.rpm
C) setup_mac.tgz
D) Full source & all necessary tools/utilities

I would like you to work to my specifications on developing a standalone
anti-spam C/R (challenge-response) email proxy application.

It sits between a users email program and SMTP/POP servers, and does its
work.  It simply has a whitelist and blacklist - dropping blacklisted
emails, and permitting whitelisted emails, and challenging unknowns (unless
they fail SPF - see spf.pobox.com).

It needs a built-in GUI to allow users to view "pending" emails and
whitelist/blacklist/delete them.

It needs graphics ability to create custom "robot hostile" challenge
request response-emails.

It needs a database to store black and white listed email addresses, and
the pending email contents.

I own the patent on this (priority filing date mid-1995), and I'm very
litigious.

Please contact me if you're interested and want more info.  If you sound
suitable and affordable, I'll invent a "test" for you to complete, and if
you pass it to my satisfaction, you've got the job.

This is likley to be an on-going position - there will forever be new
features and upgrades to apply.

Wage increases in line with profitability are availble in the medium to
long term.

Required skills:
*strong* perl on Windows and Linux

I personally don't like OO - so ability to lean towards "procedural style"
programming is a non-negotiable requirement.

wxWindows

Strong sockets programming (eg: ability to use "select()" to handle (poll)
multiple simultaneous connections without forking)

Must sign non-disclosure statement.

Desired skills:

Knowledge of SMTP and POP protocols

Ability to create standalone installer

Understand how to code for Windows/Linux (and Mac OSX)
