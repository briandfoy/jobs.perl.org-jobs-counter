Job title:
OO/DBI/XML Programmer for Financial Institution

Company name: Dimensional Fund Advisors

Location: United States, CA, Santa Monica

Pay rate: $75 - 80 / hr.

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have a framework for financial industry client reporting and want to
extend it to produce additional material.  The focus of the project will be
abstracting each underlying layer of the system away from the actual
application -- database calls, XML output -- to allow for easier and more
varied extensions in the future.

An example would be the creation of a Characteristics class that queries
the database for relevant information and passes back the output of
multiple SQL queries as a single result (say, an array of hashrefs).  That
result would then be passed to a subroutine that would output each hashref
as XML.  That XML might be combined with the XML from Attributions or
Transactions APIs to produce a specific report.

Additional work will involve writing XSL to transform the XML into FO for
production of PDFs.  Knowledge of XSL is very helpful, FO can be learned on
the job.  There is some slight PHP involved, as the user interface.

Required skills:
Perl class creation
MySQL/DBI
XML generation
XSL

Desired skills:
FO
PHP
