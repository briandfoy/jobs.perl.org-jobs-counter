Description:
ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be playing a central role in the
design, development, and delivery of web applications for one of the most
heavily-trafficked network of real estate sites on the web. You will work
in a small, collaborative environment with other seasoned pros and with the
direct support of the companyâ€™s owners and CTO.  Your canvas and raw
materials include rich data sets totaling several million property listings
replenished daily by hundreds of external data feeds. This data and our
end-user tools to access it are deployed across several thousand real
estate search sites used by more than a million home-buyer leads and
growing by 50K+ users each month.  The 1M+ leads using our search tools are
in turn tracked and cultivated by the several thousand real estate
professionals using our management software. This is an outstanding
opportunity to see your creations immediately embraced by a large community
of users while you enjoy working within a creative and supportive
environment.  

BENEFITS
We're offering a competitive starting salary with opportunity for growth,
medical benefits, paid holidays and personal days, paid monthly parking, a
casual work environment with no dress code, a well-stocked kitchen,
frequent company lunches and dinners, and the opportunity to join a
talented and committed team of engineers as well as extremely nice folks in
all areas of the company.  Participation in the twice-daily Quake sessions
is voluntary but encouraged. Relocation assistance is available.  We're
located in sunny West Los Angeles, 10 minutes from Santa Monica and the
beach, a short walk from UCLA and with public transportation a block away.

AN ENDORSEMENT: As a fan of Perl, you may be familiar with Tim Bunce,
author and maintainer of the Perl DBI module which has been the standard
database interface for Perl since 1994. Tim has been part of our team for
several years and was kind enough to say "TigerLead is a lovely company to
work for and this is a great opportunity. Highly recommended."	      

COMPANY BACKGROUND
TigerLead Solutions is a privately held, owner-operated and thriving young
company in its sixth year of providing residential property search portals,
online marketing services and lead management SaaS to successful Realtors

senior role within our team of engineers.

Required skills:
-a *nix enthusiast with solid history of success in open source web
development
-prefer to work in all layers of the stack

-strong background in OO architecture and MVC design
-comfort with Git or Subversion
-Excellent communication and collaboration skills
-Demonstrable interest in learning and adopting new tools and techniques
-enjoys an intellectually vigorous environment and contributes to that
