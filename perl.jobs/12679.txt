Job title: Director of Technical Operations (Perl)

Company name: Where2GetIt

Internal ID: 1001

Location: Arlington Heights, IL

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You are currently a perl developer. You are looking for your next move up
the ladder. You'd like to continue doing some Perl development. This
position has your name on it. The Director of Technical Operations is
responsible for managing the daily technical operations of Perl application
development including integrating offshore development activities, managing
code deployments, and coordinating and improving all operational tasks (all
done in perl of course).

Where2GetIt is a fast paced Internet organization in the middle of the
hottest Internet growth areas, location based services. Our continued
growth and success is dependent upon highly motivated and highly skilled
individuals. If you want to join a team of like minded people, this is the
place for you. With hundreds of brand name clients around the world, we
help consumers find our client's products (either online or offline).  This
position will have the opportunity to dip its toes into all aspects of the
consumer experience. From front end AJAX, mobile applications (iPhone,
Android), to social integration, to the spatial databases you'll be busy
learning about the latest technologies in the LBS world. Our office is
located 1 block from the NW Metra line in downtown Arlington Heights, IL
which means there are lots of great eating places and some good pubs too.

We've been in business 15 years so we are extremely stable, not dependent
upon VC funding and not susceptible to the fluxating economy (in fact we
keep to growing). We'll continue to grow as we re-invent ourselves to meet
the needs of our clients. Did I mention that you get to participate in the
company ESOP program?

Required skills:
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related
discipline; equivalent experience acceptable
Experience in Perl development
Experience in Subversion
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
Effective interpersonal and communications skills; strong mentoring
abilities for teamwork and interdepartmental communications

Experience in Javascript (libraries like Prototype, jQuery, dojo)
Previous experience mentoring junior level staff as well as project
management experience.
