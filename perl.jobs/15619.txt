provider of IP intelligence and online fraud detection tools.  MaxMind is
privately held and based in Waltham, Massachusetts.

Transaction fraud
detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is never done.
Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection, which means
we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud detection
service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP products, which
associate geographical and other data with individual IP addresses. We
screen over a billion online transactions each year and provide IP
intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.


THE POSITION:

fraud detection engine. You would work on reviewing transaction data to
detect patterns, identify improvements, and update our algorithms to
uncover more fraud.

fraudulent transactions as reported by our customers.
- Detecting fraud
patterns using abductive reasoning
- Updating code in our machine learning
and rule set framework to improve fraud detection

review tasks
- Exploring other data sets to find correlations with fraud.

Compensation includes a starting salary of $100k/year (depending on
qualifications) and participation in a performance-based bonus plan. The
position is based at our Waltham office.

WORKING AT MAXMIND:
MaxMind is a
casual, friendly, results-focused company of 30-some employees, about half
of whom are in technical positions. We maintain a set of core, overlapping
hours, but weâ€™re flexible with specific start and end times and are
understanding about appointments and life events.

In addition to medical,
dental, and vision coverage, we offer several other benefits including a
401k with employer contribution, FSA, and transit reimbursement.

Our
office is located near downtown Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, a five
minute walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus
lines.


OUR DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES:
Our data analytics code is largely
written in Perl using PostgreSQL and Linux. We maintain fast development
cycles and identify small, incremental improvements that add up over time.
