Description:
Large publishing company is looking for software developers to work on
dynamic content websites, ecommerce systems, and in-house administrative /

We strive to write clean object-oriented code and make judicious use of
CPAN.  We are open source friendly, both in terms of using and contributing

Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential.

We have positions located in our New York City (midtown) office.

Significant experience working in a Unix environment (preferably Linux),
strong Perl development skills, with some relational database (MySQL

Desired skills:
This is a software development position, however experience with mod_perl,
MySQL, and/or HTML::Mason is a big plus. Other things we 'd find to be a
plus are experience with Apache configuration, Linux system administration,
and any database administration.
