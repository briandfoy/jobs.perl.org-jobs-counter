Description:

Location: San Francisco, CA
Compensation: 80,000-90,000


You will get to make an immediate impact on the future success of an online
marketplace.  Our site is experiencing explosive growth with tremendous
uptake within our target market. As a result, our product team is looking
to expand to support the development and release of a long list of exciting
new features. 

Position Summary
================
You will initially wear two hats.  Your primary responsibility will be QA
Engineer.  A secondary responsibility will be contributing to our Support
team.  Support entails both front-line, customer-facing activity (generally
via email) as well as assisting our sales staff with the questions and data
needs they have.  The expected breakdown of work is 75% QA and 25% Support
for the immediate future.

What we need most: 
A talented self-starter with exceptional internal drive. You will be
delivery-focused and success oriented.	We need a QA engineer who can
partner with the software engineers and build a culture of test-driven
development.  You should be a creative thinker who will push your abilities
to the maximum to develop creative solutions for our team and our users.  

Position Goals for the Next 12 Months
=====================================
* Co-develop innovative processes that allow for the fastest and most
efficient delivery of rock-solid software
* Develop a suite of automated tests that bring quality as far forward in
the process as possible and act as a force multiplier for our small team
* Create, document, and execute manual testcases for new functionality
* Execute, improve, and extend documented manual testcases for existing
functionality
* Maintain the level of high-touch, high-quality customer support that we
have provided to date

The Toughest Parts of this Job
==============================
* Priorities are constantly changing.  We are building an entirely new
marketplace and every day we learn new things that force us to reevaluate
prior learnings and assumptions. 
* Documentation of requirements may be limited.  We do our best to document
where we are going, but often change direction (see point #1) along the
way.  You may start out planning to test a black sports car but ultimately
get presented with a hot pink Winnebago.



The Bottom Line
===============
No two days will ever be the same in this highly dynamic and evolving
organization and you will be constantly challenged across all dimensions. 
This position represents an opportunity for an entrepreneurial,
business-savvy technologist to help guide and shape the direction of a
young organization.  If you can perform this role exceptionally well and
help us exceed our aggressive success metrics then your career trajectory
could mirror our site's amazing growth curve.


Required skills:
Skills and Experiences We Need to See
=====================================
* 3-5 years experience testing web applications
* 3 years hands-on experience ***coding*** automated tests
* 3 years programming experience with Perl, Ruby, or similar
* 3 years SQL experience 
* Demonstrated ability to work in a highly fluid environment
