Description:
We are a Contract Hire and Leasing company with a slight difference. Our

We are looking for a junior Perl programmer to work within our small web

Knowledge of Perl is essential.

We maintain two public web sites and a private administration web site
deploying two web server hosts that run Apache, and one database server
running an Oracle 10g instance.  All web and database servers use Linux as
their operating system.

The Oracle instance contains one schema shared by all three web sites,
containing the data, and low-level routines implemented in Oracle PL/SQL. 
The web server host runs Apache 2 frontend processes that serve static
content and pass CGI requests through to Apache/mod_perl backend processes.
 The application layer is implemented purely in Perl, with a common code
base used by all public and private web sites.

Required skills:
A knowledge of Perl is essential and the ability to interact with a team is
