Job title: Perl module to access Google information

Company name: Lacerte Development

Location: Canada, British Columbia, Victoria

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have some work that I need done for a Web based service I am building.
Basically I have a number of Perl modules that need to be written. My
service will use these modules to interact with third party services in
order to transfer information between them. As an example, I have a
Facebook module which allows my site to obtain friend and event information
from a Facebook users account. I also have a similar module to access gmail
contacts and Google calendar information. These modules basically talk to
the CPAN available modules with some enhancements as needed. Initially I
need the Google module finished... it has some problems creating contacts
on the Google side and there are some missing fields in contacts and
calendar events that need to be added. Once the Google module is complete
there are a number of other modules that will need to be written for other
sites such as Bebo, Plaxo, etc. Each of these modules will be dealt with as
a separate project. If you are interested in taking on this work please get
in touch and I can provide more details.

Required skills: Perl programming

Desired skills:
interfacing with third party sites via their API (Facebook, MySpace, Bebo,
Google, etc.)
