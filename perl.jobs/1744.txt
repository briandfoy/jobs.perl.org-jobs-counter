Job title: mod_perl Software Engineer

Company name: Semantico

Internal ID: MS/SE

Location: United Kingdom, East Sussex, Brighton

Pay rate: £25K - £35K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Semantico create and support online publishing solutions for major
publishers. We have two main areas of activity: individual site or
platform-based publishing; and access management systems. 

We have developed a number of award-winning sites including Oxford
Reference Online and the the Grove Dictionaries of Art and Music, SYBWorld,
The International Who's Who and the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 

We have developed access control solutions for Oxford University Press,
Macmillan Publishing and the Taylor & Francis Group. 

We require an experienced software engineer to contribute to the technical
development of our award-winning Internet applications. We develop in a
Linux/Perl/Apache environment so you should be a very skilled Perl
developer with at least three years' experience of object oriented Perl. 



Required skills:
You should have a very good knowledge of Linux and be able to do a
reasonable amount of admin tasks yourself without the need for an
Administrator. 
We will expect you to be comfortable with team software development, have
excellent communication skills and clear problem solving ability.
Participation in the process of creating, refining and interpreting
technical plans and specifications is critical, as is your knowledge of
formal design techniques including UML.
