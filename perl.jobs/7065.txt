Job title: Perl Application Developer

Company name: Info Plus International

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3+months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Talented people make all the difference. Info Plus International possesses
one of the most important competitive advantages in the marketplace: we
have a valuable relationship equity in our people. They have built
long-standing relationships and partnerships with their colleagues and
clients. They are proud of their personal and professional achievements,
helping to propel IPI to the forefront and be recognized by our clients and
peers as a leading IT/Telecom consulting organization.

We are an IT/Network Consulting Firm in San Mateo, CA and we have an
immediate assignment for a very large computer manufacturer modifying some
feeds of Telecom data for an Executive Dashboard application that they have
built in-house.  The team will be comprised of expertise in the following
areas:
1) Data Collection - coders, programmers
2) Data Transformation Developers
3) User Interface GUI

Here's what we know - this project will be performed in two phases.

Phase I: Stabilization to be completed within 4-6 weeks
To bring stability to our customers' PBX metrics system to improve the data
collection process by adding new OSX servers to collect data and writing
some software to streamline the movement of data into those new servers. 
The platform is made up of taking feeds from the Avaya PBX(s) located
around the world and manipulating the data with Perl scripts to put into a
MYSQL database.  PHP is the language that the web application is built to
display this streamed data in a dashboard UI.  Immediate means a start date
within a week or so.  The initial project would be a short term engagement
but we believe the subsequent phase(s) could keep us engaged for a bit. 
They actually want to redesign/re-architect the solution in the longer
term.  The short term need is to stabilize this process globally before the
holiday peak volumes start by establishing additional servers in Cork
Ireland and in Cupertino.

Phase II: Re-engineering project
There is a need to re-engineer the current dashboard product to improve the
architecture as well as the features of the actual dashboard. Essential
skills are for UI a designer.  

~ Local San Francisco Bay Area candidates only
~ Work to be done by the end of November

~ Technology:
1. Avaya reports pulled from ASA and AIM
2. My SQL database
3. Perl scripts to manipulate reports data to push to database
4. PHP to place data on Website (Dashboard UI)
5. OSX Server setup and administration
6. Familiar with call center metrics, PBX platform, and Windows knowledge
will be beneficial.
~ Understanding of Contact Center metrics
~ Specific programming experience needed to develop the data collection
layer, data transformation layer and UI layer.
