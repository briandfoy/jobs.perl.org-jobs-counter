Job title: Perl Programmer

Company name: Thermeon

Location: UK

Pay rate: £40-60k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Thermeon are looking for experienced programmers to join its UK development
team. Applicants should be versatile and inquisitive by nature, able to
adapt to new technologies, frameworks and languages. A personal interest in
computing and programming should drive applicants to explore and innovate
on their own. Thermeon provides services and software primarily to the car
rental industry, and employees find interesting challenges that stimulate
innovative solutions using the full range of technical resources available.


Thermeon's development team telecommutes. We have a passionate and
experienced team of perl developers working well together remotely.
Applicants should ideally have experience with remote working, and have a
suitable stable environment free of distractions. Travel to our Gatwick
office will be required occasionally. Applicants must have the right to
work in the UK.

Applicants should be fluent in the Linux environment with experience in
web services, web servers, databases and networking.
They must have strong history of planning and delivering projects from
beginning to end.

An engaged approach to problem solving and a self-reliance are key
attributes for a candidate. Thermeon will continue to investigate and
adopt new technologies and employees should always enjoy learning to
apply new dynamic solutions to existing problems.

Required skills:
Whilst a capacity to learn is fundamental to the role, the following
skills/familiarities are very desirable:

- Perl 4+ years
- Modern web frameworks (Catalyst, Dancer, Mojolicious, etc)
- Async / event systems ( IO::Async, AnyEvent, POE, etc )
- MOP/sugar libraries ( Moose, Moo, Moops, etc)
- Unit testing
- Version Control (git/hg)
- Web interfaces (XML/SOAP/HTML/CSS)
- Javascript frameworks (ExtJS ideally)
- Databases (Postgresql, cassandra)
- Linux environment (zsh/Bash/vim)
- Web Servers (nginx/lighttpd/etc)
