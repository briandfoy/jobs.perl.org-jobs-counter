Job title: Small Project $400 Bot Creation scraping SERPs

Company name: Silver Fox

Location: SF

Pay rate: $400

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Im looking to have a bot created that would be built in perl that would use
search engines to look up products. The specifics of the project are below:


1. import from a csv input file, a query 
2. perform the query on the first search engine
3. parse the results page(SERP) for specific data elements
4. output the resulting data 
5. perform a calculation to compare two numbers, one from the input file
and one from the parsed results of the SERP.
6. output the results from the parsing the SERP and the calculation in #5
above to an output CSV file
7. Name the file date stamp.csv


Im only looking for developers who have scraped SERPS before and know their
way around using Proxies. This script needs to be installed on a linux box.
Please only bid if you have the time to work on this to have it done by
Friday May 3rd. 

Thanks fellow Perl enthusiasts.

Desired skills: Experience scraping SERPs
