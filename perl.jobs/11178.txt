Description:
COMPANY BACKGROUND
TigerLead Solutions is a privately held, owner-operated and thriving young
company in its fifth year of providing cutting-edge residential property
search portals, online marketing services and lead management SaaS to
successful Realtors throughout North America.  We're seeking a talented
developer to assume a senior role within our team of engineers and
spearhead the creation of tools that users will love, such as our latest
offering (http://tigerlead.com/product/new_media) showcasing an
industry-first real estate search capability entirely within the Facebook
environment.  

ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY
As a Senior Developer, you will be playing a central role in the design,
development, and delivery of cutting-edge web applications for one of the
most heavily-trafficked network of real estate sites on the web. You will
work in a small, collaborative environment with other seasoned pros and
with the direct support of the company’s owners and CTO.  Your canvas and
raw materials include rich data sets totaling several million property
listings replenished daily by hundreds of external data feeds. This
valuable data and our powerful end-user tools to access it are deployed
across several thousand real estate search sites used by more than a
million home-buyer leads and growing by 50K+ users each month.	The 1M+
leads using our search tools are in turn tracked and cultivated by the
several thousand real estate professionals using our management software.
This is an outstanding opportunity to see your creations immediately
embraced by a large community of users as you work within a creative and
supportive environment that is both professional and non-bureaucratic at
the same time, offering the positives of a start-up culture without the
drama and instability. 

BENEFITS
We're offering a competitive starting salary with opportunity for growth,
medical benefits, paid holidays and personal days, paid monthly parking, a
casual work environment with no dress code, a well-stocked kitchen with
both healthy and not-so-healthy food and beverages, the opportunity to join
a talented and committed team of engineers as well as extremely nice folks
in all areas of the company.  Participation in the twice-daily Quake
sessions is voluntary but highly encouraged. 

AN ENDORSEMENT: If you're into Perl, you probably know of Tim Bunce.  Tim
has been part of our team for several years and was kind enough to say
"TigerLead is a lovely company to work for and this is a great opportunity.
Highly recommended."	    

Required skills:
Generally, we are looking for a talented and reliable pro who is not afraid
to take ownership of challenges and who has a "let’s get it done"
mentality. You will receive clear guidance on business goals and see
immediate results from your work. You will work with intelligent and driven
colleagues, and you should be the type of person who enjoys and contributes
to that intensity. You will have ample opportunity to develop your own
ideas and designs while you also welcome frequent input from team members.
 
Specifically, qualified candidates are expected to bring:
-5+ years professional software development experience
-Rich browser-based development experience (JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS)
-Either a) expertise in a *nix environment with tools and languages such as
Perl / Catalyst, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and GIT or B) expertise with
alternatives giving you the ability to quickly learn our stack and/or the
confidence to recommend and then lead the implementation of new tools of
your choice
-BA/BS Computer Science or a technical/quantitative degree
-Unit testing experience and automated integration testing (Selenium)
experience is a plus
-Excellent communication and collaboration skills
-Demonstrable interest in learning and adopting new tools and techniques
-Great attitude and a sense of humor (non-negotiable); you're the kind of
person that coworkers look forward to seeing every morning
