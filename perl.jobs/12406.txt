Pay rate: $80K-$110K USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
Company Background
TigerLead Solutions is a leading provider of internet marketing services
and management software to Realtors throughout North America. TigerLead is
a thriving young company offering a cutting-edge set of services to an
enthusiastic and expanding client base. We're seeking a talented Perl
developer to assume a key role within our team of engineers and help
spearhead the creation of apps and features that users will love.

About the Opportunity
As a Web Applications Developer, you will be playing a central role in
creating and improving web applications for one of the most
heavily-trafficked network of real estate sites on the web. You will work
in a small, collaborative environment with other seasoned pros and with the
direct support of the company's owners and CTO. Your canvas and raw
materials include rich data sets totaling several million property listings
replenished daily by hundreds of external data feeds. This valuable data
and our powerful end-user tools to access it are deployed across several
thousand real estate search sites used by nearly two million home-buyer
leads and growing by 50K+ users each month. The prospective home buyer
leads using our search tools are in turn tracked and cultivated by the
several thousand real estate professionals using our management software.
This is an outstanding opportunity to see your creations immediately
embraced by a large community of users while you enjoy working in a stable
and positive environment. 

Benefits
We're offering a competitive starting salary with opportunity for growth,
medical benefits, paid holidays and personal days, paid monthly parking or
public transportation pass, a casual work environment with no dress code, a
new high-end workstation with your personal specs, a well-stocked kitchen
with both healthy and not-so-healthy food and beverages, and the
opportunity to work with a talented and committed team of engineers as well
as extremely nice folks in all other areas of the company too.
Participation in the twice-daily Quake sessions is voluntary but highly
encouraged. This is a full-time position in our comfortable offices in West
LA near UCLA and public transportation hubs. We are not able to consider
contractor or telecommuting arrangements at this time, although occasional
work from home could be OK once you are established. Relocation assistance
is negotiable.

An Endorsement
If you're a fan of Perl, then you're probably familiar with Tim Bunce. Tim
has been part of our team for several years and was kind enough to say
"TigerLead is a lovely company to work for and this is a great opportunity.
Highly recommended."
