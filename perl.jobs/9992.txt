Job title: Sr. Systems Administrator and Tools Dev

Company name: Quantcast

Location: CA, San Francisco

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Quantcast is looking to hire a Linux/UNIX expert with extensive WAN
experience. As we’re currently collecting data from over 8 million page
views a day, across 10 million directly measured sites, this is a unique
opportunity to work on one of the largest computing infrastructures in the
world. The ideal candidate should be excited by working on a global scale,
multi-locational WAN, in a start-up environment. Our highly skilled team is
small and tight-knit, providing the ideal environment for someone looking
to make a visible impact and contribute to Quantcast’s success.

Quantcast provides publishers, agencies and marketers unmatched abilities
to measure, segment, and target audiences based upon inference models that
couple machine learning with massive quantities of directly measured
audience and reference data. This approach overcomes the challenges and
limitations of traditional media measurement services that rely on panels
and expands the limited delivery of retargeting approaches to reach a
larger, more qualified audience.  We were recently named the #3 most
innovative web company in 2010 by FastCompany, behind Facebook and Google,
and we are roughly 80 employees.  We offer a full benefits package.


Required skills:
Responsibilities:
· Administration of existing global infrastructure
· Management of alarm/alert systems including familiarity with standard
alarm and monitoring software/methods and development of new
alert/monitoring subsystems
· “Lights out” and remote datacenter deployment and management
· Experience with management of large compute and serving clusters and
associated issues such as automation, configuration management, deployment,
inventory, hardware troubleshooting, system troubleshooting, etc.
· 24 hour on-call duty as necessary
· Some travel required

Requirements:
· Bachelor’s in Computer Science, Networking or Electrical Engineering or
equivalent professional experience
· Expert knowledge of Linux administration and production operations
· Understanding and tuning of Linux internals
· Extensive knowledge of networking protocols on the wire and by RFC,
especially TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.
· Experience with package management systems like RPM for building and
deploying custom software
· Extensive Experience scripting in Perl, Python, or Ruby
· Experience multi-datacenter deployments
· Flexibility to deal with novel, and fast-paced deployment environments
· Excellent planning and prioritization skills
· Vendor negotiation and management background a plus
· Experience running a production 24/7 web site
