Job title:
Experienced Unix Perl developer for advanced network monitoring

Company name: nnit A/S

Internal ID: Network

Location: Denmark, Copenhagen, Bagsvaerd

Pay rate: To be negotiated

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You will be designing, documenting, implementing and maintaining UNIX/Linux
applications, which your colleagues use in their day-to-day work in the
network and monitoring group. You will be an important part of a network
team with 24 other specialists who develop, operate, monitor and maintain
our clients' worldwide networks.

You can develop yourself here
You enjoy working in a team where collaboration, helping each other,
initiative and knowledge sharing are keywords. We have room for differences
and give you the space you need if a colleague needs a hand or tight
deadlines have to be met.

In NNIT we work with a special conscience, where we take on the
responsibility for our clients' IT as if it were our own. We live our
values every day, so you should be able to see yourself in them. We are
conscience driven, value adding, open and honest.


Required skills:
Your base is broad Unix (Linux) experience, preferably from a large
installation or a career as a consultant. 

You have at least two years' experience with developing, documenting and
maintaining Linux applications (SUSE, Red Hat, etc.) with Apache,
PostgreSQL and MySQL and network tools such as SNMP, traceroute, Nmap and
others.
You master one or more programming languages with the emphasis on Perl, PHP
and possibly C/C++. We also expect you to have knowledge of CGI
programming.
You are good at written and spoken Danish and English.
Qualified applicants will be called for interview as applications are
received.


Desired skills:
You will be supporting the monitoring of our clients' networks using a
large number of applications, mostly based on UNIX (Linux) and open-source
applications. 

The monitoring applications communicate with a central PostgreSQL database,
which contains the status for all the network units and a number of
servers. Any alarms are presented on a dynamic PHP-generated web page,
which is one of the tools used by our 24x7 monitoring.

You will need your good analytical sense when you take on the
responsibility for these complicated tasks. You manage to structure the
abstract and turn it into solutions which work well. You are also a good
teamworker and have a good sense of humour.

You should be prepared to deliver very high quality in everything you do,
as we work according to the rules for regulated industries in many of our
environments. We therefore document all our work, and you should agree with
us that documentation and quality control are fundamental for successful
teamwork.

We invest heavily in your skills development. You will receive ongoing
training in the newest technologies in the network field, and you will be
certified in Unix and networks (Cisco) if you are not already.
