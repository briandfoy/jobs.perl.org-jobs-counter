Job title: Software Engineer, Google.com 

Company name: Google

Internal ID: 23593

Location: United States, California, Mountain View

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This position is available in Mountain View, CA, Seattle and Kirkland, WA,
Santa Monica, CA, New York, NY, Sydney, Australia, Dublin, Ireland and
Zurich, Switzerland.
The area: Google.com Engineering

With analytical and code-level troubleshooting abilities to spare,
Google.com's engineers are technology whizzes who love being in the center
of the action. We tackle a range of complex software and systems issues,
including monitoring, responding to and safeguarding the availability of
our most popular services.
The role: Software Engineer, Google.com

Are you part ace coder, part adrenaline junkie? Do you have a knack for
seeing a problem and immediately discerning the likely solution? Maybe
you've been coding for years, are bored with the old
design-build-review-test-ship-repeat routine, and yearn for some
faster-paced challenges? Or perhaps you're a seasoned software engineer who
is also a genius at jockeying networks and administering UNIX clusters.

We're looking for top-notch thrill-seeking software engineers to join the
Google.com engineering team. Google.com engineers are in the thick of
everything involved with keeping Google running, from code-level
troubleshooting of service anomalies to safeguarding the availability of
our most popular services; from monitoring and response to building new
automation infrastructure to balancing the desire for change management
with the need for stability. All team members must have strong analytical
and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding, good communication skills,
and most of all enthusiasm for tackling the complex problems of scale which
are uniquely Google. We tackle challenging, novel situations every day, and
work with just about every other engineering and operations team at Google
in the process. 

Required skills:
In this role you will need:

    * Expertise in coding, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale
distributed systems.
    * Experience in a high-volume or critical production service
environment.
    * Strong understanding of IP networking, including the ability to
analyze network behavior, performance and application issues using standard
tools like tcpdump.

Qualifications:

    * 0-15+ years experience.
    * 3+ years developing web-based applications.
    * Expertise in data structures, algorithms, and complexity analysis.
    * Fluency in one or more of: C, C++, Java.
    * Fluency in one of more of: Shell, PHP, Perl or Python.
    * Ability to handle periodic on-call duty as well as out-of-band
requests.
    * Solid working knowledge of Unix, preferably Linux.
    * Tack-sharp analytical abilities.
    * A strong sense of ownership, urgency, and drive.
    * Fluent written communication and unusual verbal agility are strong
assets.
    * SQL experience a plus, MySQL a plus.
    * Experience leading short projects involving outside teams is a plus.
    * BA/BS in CS, MS or PhD is preferred.
