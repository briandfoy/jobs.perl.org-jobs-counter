Code LAMP stack application from requirements. User interface using JAVA

The application under development supports the connection between requests
for access  (a web portal for access and smart-badge requests) to a
database of facility and person information, to several  individual
proprietary access control systems through file interfaces and
web-services.

-	   The application runs on Linux VMs.

-	   The application interfaces with several up-stream and downstream
data sources and work-flow systems.

-	   This is a LAMP environment and NOT a windows environment

-	   The application is written in PERL, on a MySQL database, with
Javascript for the user interface.

-	   BRD and FSD are well laid out, though there is constant team
dialog to question and confirm technical details.

-	   The development team is now a designer/coder, and two other
developers. The team will expand by one with this opening.

-	   We anticipate 2 more application releases in 2010 (end of q3,
end of q4)

-	   No particular information security or cryptographic background
is required.

-	   Recent and substantial Javascript / Perl experience is a key
selection factor, and the most important success criteria for this

be impediments. Recent and substantial Perl and Javascript experience are
key drivers.
