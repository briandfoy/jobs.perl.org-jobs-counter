Job title:
Passive Security Scanner Control Panel Needed

Company name: Nick Temple

Internal ID: Security Scanner

Location: United States, Kentucky, Louisville

Pay rate: Open

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have just released an ebook that shows non-technical people how to begin
to secure their websites. Part of the service I am providing is a scanning
services that will:

a) Search Google (using the API) and related websites for common security
issues (old versions of vulnerable web software, unsecured front page
extensions, etc).

b)Does a basic port-scan for open vlulnerabilities, as well as
recomendations for each port found open.

I need the internal tool to perform these scans, then generate a "pretty"
HTML report that lists the items checked, warnings in yellow and critical
issues highlighted in red.

Other ideas for passive, external scanning are welcome.

I need someone to build this tool, using existing open source software.
Customers are predominantly on shared hosted environments, with ISP's that
may not be security conscious.	Many also have unmanaged dedicated servers
that are extremely insecure.

Also, I need a tool that helps me look up the owner of the IP address
(users ISP) so that I can do basic verification  and obtain permission
before performing the scan.

These tools are for internal use, the customers will not have access to the
tools themselves only the generated reports.

Finally, as an additional service, we need a few companies that we can
outsouce server hardening to, when vulnerabilities are detected. I prefer
companies that are Visa / Mastercard "certified", but that is not a
requirement as long as I have some way to verify the company we recommend
is indeed legitimate and well run / organized.

Payment upon completion, longer term work availble for the
rignt individual.


Required skills:
Perl, Security Awareness, Google API, Port Scanning software

Desired skills: Fluent in english.
