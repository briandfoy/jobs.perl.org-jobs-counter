Job title: Perl / Mason / DBI programmer

Company name: Giganews

Location: United States, TX, Austin

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Steady gig with the Usenet industry leader, profitable since '94, small
privately-owned company.

My team has a hand in pretty much everything that isn't directly related to
providing NNTP service - external websites, internal websites, accounting
databases, authentication, you name it.  Not a lot of bureaucracy, and
there's always something new to work on.

You must be in Austin or willing to move, and already eligible for work in
the US.

Required skills:
Perl
(You don't have to be an expert, but you do have to be quick on the
uptake.)

Unix
(We do all our work in GNU screen sessions on remote machines, running vi /
emacs / $EDITOR.  If you're not comfortable on the command line, this is
not the job for you.)

Abstraction & Composition 
(If you're still writing 2,000 line scripts with no subs, this is not the
job for you)

Love of programming 
(If you don't code on your own for fun, this is not the job for you)

Desired skills:
Tools we use on a regular basis:
OO Perl
Mason
mod_perl
SQL
DBI
HTML
CSS

Exposure to multiple paradigms (OOP, functional, logic) and languages
(Lisp, Haskell, Prolog) is a plus.
