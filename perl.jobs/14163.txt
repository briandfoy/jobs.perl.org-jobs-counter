Job title: Senior Perl Developer, Telecommute

Company name: Ucompass

Internal ID: PD201404

Location: Tallahassee, FL

Pay rate: Highly Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Do you want to be a part of something big? We are building a
next-generation Learning Management System (LMS) that will change the way
students learn and radically alter the way students interact with
educational material. Imagine a system that can detect a student spending
an inordinate amount of time on a lesson or assessment and automatically
serves up other alternatives; alternatives that represent the same
educational material, but in a way that might be more palatable for the
particular student. Or a system that can compare a particular student's
interactions within specific lesson material, compare it against metrics
from other students and alert the instructor before the student loses
his/her way?

You, as a Senior Developer, will play a big role in developing this complex
system. Are you willing to work hard? Are you willing to interact with and
learn from other talented developers and brilliant professionals from
virtual schools? Are you ready to change the way our kids learn? If the
answers to these questions are a resounding YES, then we want you working
with us!

We are based in Tallahassee, FL. However, this is a TELECOMMUTING position.
We want a senior developer who has good Perl skills and experience and is
passionate. If we find multiple qualified candidates, we will give a slight
preference to those who are located in and around Tallahassee or in the San
Francisco Bay area.

Required skills:
- Perl, Perl and more Perl
- OO design
- MySQL and/or other relational database experience
- SQL
- Templating (TT2, Mason, etc)
- Unix (FreeBSD, Linux)

Desired skills:
- Client side experience with HTML, JavaScript and CSS
- Version control (git, svn)
