Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Location: Somerville, MA (Davis Square)

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for a motivated, customer service oriented engineer to
assist our clients with new product deployments and upgrades. You should be
familiar with UNIX systems administration on a number of different
distributions. You will be responsible for ensuring that the new or
upgraded system is fully deployed and functioning per the clients
specification. You will also assist us with streamlining our installation
process and updating relevant documentation, as well as participating in
some amount of core development on the product.

Required skills:
You should be a self-starter who has 1-3 years experience with Perl;
previous systems administration background is highly desirable. You should
also have some experience with at least a few of the following buzzwords:

- Web servers (Apache, lighttpd, nginx)
- Mail Servers (postfix, exim, sendmail, fetchmail)
- SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Open source development practices
- Distributed source control (git, branching, patches)
- Test driven development (smoke testing, Test::More)
- Documentation (user-facing, API)

It's okay if you don't know everything out of the gate, but you should be
able to learn on the fly and be comfortable asking questions when you get
in over your head. RT is a mature codebase with a diverse set of deployment
options, and a decently large amount of code to explore -- so you should be
prepared to work with a project that's too big to hold all of the
implementation details of in your head all at once. If you want to see what
sort of trouble you're getting yourself into, you can find all of our open
source code on github.
