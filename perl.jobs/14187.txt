Job title:
OOP Perl, Catalyst, HTML::Mason Programmer (Remote / Boston)

Location: (Remote / Boston)

Pay rate: 20

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hello,

We are looking for a long-term remote resource to support our web 2.0 art
platform. We welcome college students with entrepreneurial spirits
alongside experienced candidates. 

You must have over 5 years of day-to-day command of: 

1) OOP Perl
2) Catalyst MVC
3) Mysql
4) HTML:: Mason
5) DBlx::Class
6) Linux server environment (Lighttpd experience)
7) Git subversion 
8) Authorize.net and OpenSRS APIs (a plus)

The pay is $20.00/hr - negotiable as our product catches on.

We're looking for time commitment of at least 10 hrs per week with
flexibility for full-time. 

You'll be working to maintain the current code base while producing patches
to handle growth and will be dedicated to the marketing team. 

Our product roadmap is mature and we are currently seeking a support
resource outside of our development team.

We're small, unique, and informal. Everyone pitch in to get things done as
effectively and as quickly as possible with accountability laid across the
team. There's a lot of excitement to our product. 

Projects will be well defined and delivered to you.
