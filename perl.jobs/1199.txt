Description:
We are developing Stock Market Game for students. The game will be web
based and developed in Perl, PHP and mySQL to be run on FreeBSD (or another
derivate of Linux/Unix).

The game would include sign-up process, ability to place trades, check
portfolio and history, generate performance graph (and apply it against
another index, such as Dow). The system should also generate top 10 (or
another number) players and winners.

The script must be well written and clean and must be well commented. The
delivery would include both PHP files as well as the .sql file.

If you can do the project please let us know and we can discuss the full
details. Please quote us the rate for the entire project (not an hourly
rate) and tell us how much time you would need to finish the project.

Thanks

Ray
