Description:
Title:	  Senior Software Engineer: Learn OO Perl in
	  High-Transaction Web Environment

Company:  Ticketmaster
Location: West Hollywood, CA

What does it take to work at Ticketmaster?

1). Do you excel at Java, C#, Ruby, Python, or C/C++? 

2). Are you an expert object-oriented developer?

3). Are you comfortable working in a linux-based dev environment?

4). Do you have some significant exposure to perl, even if only procedural
development?

If so, we'd love to speak with you.

Our development environment is heavily based on OO perl and we're happy to
cross-train you to learn OO development techniques in this language. We
would require you to have a solid engineering background in OO development
in another language, and at least some exposure to real-world development
in perl. Learning both perl and object-oriented development would be too
difficult a hill to climb in our rapid environment and we want this
experience to be a win-win all around.

Those being said, if you're already a top-flight OO perl guru, please do
apply! I'm sure that you'd feel right at home ;)

Description:
Build the guts of ticketmaster.com.  Most often you will code the "model"
and "controller" component of our software which includes working with
Perl, mod_perl, mysql, oracle, CPAN modules, and our custom ticketing API.

Throughout a typical workday you'll work on a project coding new
functionality, fix a few bugs, eat some lunch, write some unit tests, and
meet with your team to design developing projects. 

Required skills:
Desired Skillset:

• Senior-level experience in development,
  architecture, and design
• Expertise of one or more of the following:
  Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, or similar language
• You understand objects better than Erich Gamma ;) 
• Some significant experience as a perl engineer
• Proven experience working in a high-availability
  web-based environment
• Drive to learn and grow
• Strong knowledge of algorithms
• Flexibility - our business has rapidly
  changing priorities
• Thrive in a team based environment
• SQL inserting, updating, and retrieving skills
• Enthusiastic effective communication style

Bonus Points and a Get Out of Jail Free Card:

• Degree in Computer Science, Information Systems,
  or Similar

Desired skills:
Perks of Working on the Engineer/Developer Team:

• Flexible work hours
• Excellent growth potential as you'll work on
  very important core products
• Occasional outings to see the Lakers, Kings,
  and/or Clippers
• Opportunity to hone your OO Perl skills working
  with others on your team
• Exposure to and input on the technology it takes
  to run a mega high-volume website
• Occasional free movie screenings in our
  cushy private theater
• Opportunity to attend OSCON, YAPC, ApacheCon,
  and other industry conferences
