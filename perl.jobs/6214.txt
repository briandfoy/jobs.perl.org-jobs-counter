Job title: UNIX Systems and Network Administrator

Company name: Southern Records

Location: United Kingdom, England, London

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Southern Records is looking for an experienced UNIX Systems and Network
Administrator for its small team of IT personnel. This position is based at
our Wood Green (London) head office/recording studio and is open
immediately.

Southern was founded as a recording studio in the mid-1970's based on a DIY
ethic that exists in all aspects of the company to this day. Southern has
been a UNIX shop since 1985 and strongly supports Open Source solutions
within the IRIX, GNU/Linux and Apple Macintosh OS X frameworks, as well as
bespoke applications produced in-house.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in IRIX/Solaris and Linux
server administration, Mac OS X, and solid experience managing terminal
servers and dealing with console-based server administration over a WAN. A
large part of this job will involve making various bits of hardware and
software play together nicely, so good knowledge of TCP and the ability to
make patch cables and adapters for all kinds of devices (e.g. RS-232 over
Cat 5) is important. On the software side, our scripting language of choice
is Perl, so the ideal candidate will have experience programming and
maintaining OO Perl. Knowledge of C will also be necessary.

Don't forget to send us your salary requirements!

Applicants must have the right to live and work in the UK.
