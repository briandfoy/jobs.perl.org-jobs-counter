Job title: Senior Perl Programmer/General Manager

Company name: bbNetwork Ltd

Location:
UK, though international applications are welcome., Telecommute

Pay rate:
Negotiable, depending on skill/experience.

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
An experienced, committed individual is required for a combined "Senior
Perl Programmer / General Manager" position at bbNetwork Ltd - an
up-and-coming high-end Perl Message Board software company. We are set to
release our product later this month, so an immediate start is required.
This is a telecommute position, and international applicants are welcome.
 
This position is half-and-half Senior Perl Programmer, and General Manager,
as the latter part of the job is not expected to include a lot of
responsibilities yet.
 
Programming: The software is 100% OO Perl, and is due to be released later
this month, as I mentioned above. It is aimed at high-end customers,
including large businesses and web sites, however it will also be available
to regular users. You will be expected to lead the programming team,
improve and add features to our internal and public software, and fix bugs.

 
Managing: You will be expected to oversee existing staff, make sure
development is happening on-schedule, and generally ensure that all areas
of the business are functioning correctly and effectively. For example,
constantly making sure that we have enough tech support staff and
programmers is a top priority.

Exact hours of work are relaxed, and your own choosing. However, you are
expected to make sure that everything is happening on-schedule and of the
best quality. You're therefore expected to be working full time. You will
be expected to provide regular progress reports.
 
Payment will be made via GBP cheque or PayPal.com. Unfortunately, it will
likely not be possible to pay in any other method.

Required skills:
Advanced knowledge of OO Perl.
Ability to write code very quickly and accurately (i.e, as few bugs as
possible)
Ability to find and fix bugs and mistakes quickly, preferably before they
do any real-world damage.
Knowledge of DBI and different database systems.
Knowledge of HTML and CGI programming.
Ability to learn new things very quickly, particually in relation to
getting used to our existing code layout and API functions.
Ability to lead a team of programmers, making good decisions about feature
additions and schedules.
Ability to manage, hire and fire staff as and when needed, and inkeeping
with the budget.
Commitment. As you will essentially be able to make or break the business,
a real passion for your work is absolutely essential. In this sense,
workaholics are preferred - you must be able to really care about your
work.

Real-world experience is prized over formal qualifications.

Desired skills:
Basic bookkeeping skills are a bonus, but not necessary (you won't have to
fill out any books).
Knowledge of the UK legal legislation applicable to online business is also
a good bonus.
Knowledge of different internet protocols (e.g WAP, NNTP) and ability to
sift through the RFCs dedicated to them is a great bonus.
Skill with web design is another good bonus.
Experience in programming/modifying other message board software previously
is a huge bonus.

Contact information:
Please send an e-mail to hr@bbboy.net , including your resume
(.doc/.pdf/.txt attachment preferred), your contact details, and an
approximate wage you wish to receive. Unfortunately, due to the number of
resumes we were sent for our last position and predict for this one, we are
not able to consider entries which do not include the approximate wage you
wish to receive. Thanks for your understanding.
