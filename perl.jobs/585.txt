Have you ever wanted to make a big impact?

Chaffee Interactive, a leading web development firm, 
seeks a top-notch web developer to aid us in building 
web sites and web-based applications. Work from 
home or from our office in Chicago if you prefer.

We are a small company with big clients and are 
customer-service obsessed.

The successful candidate will have excellent problem 
solving skills, enjoy a job that is different from day to 
day, and possess flexible and varied skill sets. He or she
must also have the ability to quickly learn and deploy new
methods and technologies.  Ideally, the  
candidate will have a sense of humor and enjoy 
working directly with clients.

Our work environment is extremely varied. As a classic 
web shop we develop strategies and solutions for 
other companies - yet we are simultaneously engaged 
in several proprietary ventures of our own. We love 
turning ideas into reality. 

If you are able and willing to work from home, our 
downtown Chicago office, or in the middle of a forest 
with wireless access - then you might be the person 
we are looking for!

A self-starting and creative team player is a must. 
We are a very family-oriented shop and 
many of us work some strange hours to accommodate
our families. The right person will share our values, our 
fun and our success.

You must be committed to customer service and 
excellence.

Required skills:
Required Skills: 
* Minimum 2-4 years experience in web development
* Perl, PHP, UNIX, SQL a must
* Relational Databases - SQL Server, MySQL
* Provide creative solutions with the determination to 
meet deadlines in a fast-paced environment

Desired skills:
* Java, JSP, XML/XSLT, or ASP is a plus.

Personally, we expect you to have excellent 
communication skills, be easygoing, honest, extremely 
aggressive, and self-motiviated. Intellectual curiosity 
is a must, as is a strong desire to expand 
and cultivate your skill set.
