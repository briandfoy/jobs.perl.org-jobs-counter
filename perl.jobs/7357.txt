Description:
eBay is one of the largest, most complex web applications in existence. Our
team inside eBay is responsible for an agile, scalable solutions platform
where many new, innovative and original ideas are executed or put to the
test, and we want YOU to help out!
 
We are looking for a staff software engineer who is a specialist in
server-side application development, but also somewhat comfortable with
front-end presentation. You will be developing applications on a very
high-traffic LAMP platform, built on a Linux/Apache/mod_perl architecture,
with HTML::Mason and HTML::Template utilized for a multi-lingual
presentation tier. The application layer utilizes XML-based messaging over
HTTP to communicate with enterprise systems. Development will be done in
English (UTF-8), and then localized for testing and release. You must be
familiar with source control (preferably ClearCase) and bug tracking
systems, as well as full Product Development Life-Cycles (PDLC). The ideal
candidate must have a responsible, diligent work ethic, be a self-starter,
be willing to ask questions, and have a desire to do things "the right way"
rather than "just make it work". Also, must be VERY comfortable in a
Unix/Linux environment, using BASH, SSH, Vi(Vim), etc. You may be asked to
perform sysadmin tasks from time-to-time.

Some projects may also require managing development and integration across
mulitple third-party applications and teams.
