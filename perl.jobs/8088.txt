Job title: Experienced Web Programmer

Company name: Indiana University

Location: Indiana, Bloomington

Pay rate: 18-20/hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
A position to work on a medium sized web application along with another
programmer. The primary objective is to optimize the code for performance. 
 The core application is LAPP (Linux, Apache, Postgres and Perl) in nature.
 The Perl is OO and at times functional (techniques lifted from the book
"Higher Order Perl.  The code runs under mod_perl interacting with a
Postgres database.  In addition, Javascript and AJAX are used to enrich the
user interface.  The area of emphasis is to refactor the existing reports
to run much faster and scale better.  There will also be some user
interface refactoring.

The current optimization plan includes:
- Improving SQL queries by reducing the number of queries and speeding them
up ( DBIC prefetch, index search fields)
- Faster computations with two emphases: the use of triggers for
pre-calculating report data, and the use matrix operations possibly via PDL
(Perl Data Language) if the matrix size warrants it.
- Streamlining some of the Javascript to make less AJAX calls.	
- Concurrent programming be it threads in Perl or the use of actors in a
language like Scala.  The intent here would be to perform parallel
computations on disjoint objects.

Required skills:
* OOP Perl
* SQL
* ORM experience (DBIx::Class, Rose::DB::Object, Class::DBI)
* Templating Language such as Template Toolkit.
* Comfortable with Linux as a development/production environment.
* Javascript

Desired skills:
* Optimization experience (Benchmarking and profiling perl code and
database queries)
* Design Patterns such as MVC (Catalyst, CGI::Application)
* Database Design
* Testing (Unit and application, WWW::Mechanize::Test)
* Version control (CVS, subversion)
* AJAX, Javascript libraries (jQuery, Prototype)
* Java, C, Scala
* Concurrent Programming
* Knowledge of Perl Best Practices
