Job title: Web Application Software Engineer

Company name: Pearson

Internal ID: CTG-179

Location: United States, MA, Boston

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Web Application Software Engineer
Location: Boston, MA
Company: Pearson – www.pearson.com 
Products: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry, MasteringAstronomy,
MasteringBiology
	

POSITION SUMMARY:
Technology is transforming the way we educate students.  Pearson
understands this fact, and it is committed to playing a leadership role in
the transformation.  The software development group you would be joining,
referred to internally at Pearson as the “Mastering” team, is responsible
for an online homework / tutoring system for college science students.	The
specific products are called: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry,
MasteringAstronomy, and MasteringBiology.  We are extremely proud of these
products – they are based on educational research done at M.I.T. and they
have proven very effective.

The Mastering product line is built on top of standard web technology:
Perl, Flash, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, MySQL, and Apache.  It is a
high-throughput database application that services hundreds of thousands of
students.

We are currently looking for smart, experienced web developers who know
Perl and are generalists who are happiest when the entire codebase is their
playground.  That is, we are not looking for specialists at this time.	

The office is on Arlington Street at the corner of the Boston Public
Garden.  The environment is professional, but relaxed and flexible.  The
emphasis is on getting good work done effectively rather than on adhering
to someone’s idea of perfect process.  It is a small development team.	You
can have a major impact on the team dynamics and the product’s evolution.  


Note that while our server-side codebase is essentially all Perl, we do not
require you to know Perl before you get here.  If you have a deep
understanding of database driven web application architecture and consider
yourself to be a serious software engineer, then we would be happy to have
you join our team and learn Perl.

If you would like to know more about our products, take a look at the
websites for each product:
•	www.masteringphysics.com	(click on the “Listen to Dr. David
Pritchard” link)
•	www.masteringchemistry.com
•	www.masteringastronomy.com,
•	www.masteringbiology.com


Required skills:
QUALIFICATIONS:
•	Perl (or equivalent) expertise
•	Software Engineering Background 
•	Smart, Dedicated, Team Player
•	Comfortable working on a large (but organized) software project
•	Experience with multi-tier, high-throughput web applications
•	Database programming experience, working knowledge of SQL

•	Science, Engineering, and/or Math background is a plus
•	Educational / Teaching background is a plus 
•	Experience with mod-perl is a plus
•	Experience with the general Open Source toolset is a plus
