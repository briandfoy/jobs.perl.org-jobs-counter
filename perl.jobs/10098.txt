Job title: Entry/Intermediate Perl Developer

Company name: Naama Networks

Internal ID: perldev

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Description:
Naama Networks is a early stage startup focused on the online restaurant
industry. We're looking for perl developers to work on our backend systems.
Primarily API driven, we're looking for a developer that can rattle off
regexes, know when deciding not to use Moose isn't premature optimization
and isn't afraid to dirty their hands with some timely denormalization.

We're building a team of rock star developers and perl is our bedrock. If
you've got proven experience or if you don't but you've got something to
prove, we want to hear from you.

Required skills:
What we need:

- solid understanding of perl and object oriented programming
- work with a relational database, mysql in particular
- understand working in a unix environment
- a love of programming and an affinity for creative problem solving


Desired skills:
Any of these would be gravy:

- Catalyst/Moose experience
- knowledge of linux administration
- knowledge of apache and mod_perl administration
- experience with git
- experience with serialization methods like json, protocol buffers and
thrift
