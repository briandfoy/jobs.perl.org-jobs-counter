Job title:
Perl programmer required to automate Tomcat installation/upgrade/removal +
user/apps install/upgrade/deletion

Company name: Anya Services

Internal ID: ASPERL001

Location: Bangalore, India

Pay rate: $100

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I basically require a perl module to be created that automates
install/upgrades/removal of Tomcat, and also automates
install/upgrade/deletes of apps and users for the installed Tomcat.

This perl module should be designed as a module that plugs in to the Webmin
Hosting Control Panel.

I can provide you with more info on how this is to be done, in case you are
interested! You dont need to be a java developer-- you simply have to
automate installation and deployment, and addition/edits/deletes to config
files for all of the above!

Required skills: Perl

Desired skills: Java
