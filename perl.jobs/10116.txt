Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
RENTRAK CORPORATION is an information management company serving clients in
the entertainment, media, retail, and advertising industries.

Rentrak Corporation is looking to add more fantastic developers to our
team. You're probably used to being the smartest developer on your team
(but are too humble to admit it), and are looking for a place where you can
work alongside talented peers building great software on interesting
projects. We're a small enough company that you can make a big difference
here, but we're big enough that your paycheck never bounces.

Here are some things Rentrak programmers have done recently:

Wrote customized extensions to Open Source tools, to process queries
hundreds of times faster than commercial RDBMSs
Built a goal-seeking system to dynamically generate optimal SQL queries for
end-user data requests
Celebrated our 5 billionth transaction processed
Implemented software to categorize and predict consumer behavior based on
television viewing history
Competed for fame and fortune at a Rentrak sponsored programming contest
Created systems that predict movie sales in theaters, retail stores, and
video rental locations
Celebrated a coworker's birthday with a group skydive
Gave a Tech Talk to Google about our brilliant database technology (
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4681632964554085715 )
Rented a room at a local brewery, and played games all night with project
teammates

Our teams are relatively small (3-10 people), and we have a development
environment influenced by XP (http://extremeprogramming.org/) and SCRUM.

We have a nice open work area so the developers can share their brilliant
ideas, learn from each other about and extend our extensive custom
libraries, and work together to solve tough problems. We keep our source
code base well factored, and filled with unit tests.

We work with a stunningly large amount of data, and everyone here does an
amazing job of turning it into something manageable. We have a very high
hiring bar, and we feel that all the people who work here could easily get
a job at any of the major tech companies. Our management understands this,
and works hard to make sure our developers are happy and productive.

We're looking for more developers, especially ones with functional or
dynamic object-oriented development experience (e.g., Lisp, Smalltalk,
Scheme, Ocaml, SML, Haskell, Ruby, Unlambda, C++/STL/Boost, or advanced use
of Python or Perl). RDBMS experience is also helpful, especially with
terabyte-plus databases.


All of our developers work in-house.  Our office has convenient access to
public transportation and the freeway. We offer a friendly team oriented
workplace, a competitive vacation package, medical/dental and life
insurance, educational assistance, 401(k) plan, and a variety of extras.

successful completion of background investigation and pre-employment drug
screen. No recruiters or agencies without a previously signed contract. No
phone calls please.
