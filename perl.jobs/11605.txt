Job title: Perl Developer for London Startup

Company name: Adzuna

Location: UK, London

Pay rate: 35k to 45k GBP

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking to recruit an experienced, professional perl developer to
support the growth and development of our next-generation classified ads
search engine.	The site to date has been developed on the back end by a
single experienced lead developer, however we are now looking to expand our
team.

You will need good communication skills and attention to detail as well as
technical ability. You will also need to understand the importance of
building structured code that is fast, scalable, reliable and robust.  As
part of a very small but talented team you need to thrive working
independently and in a fast-moving, low-structure environment.

The kind of projects you will be working on include  new search features
and relevancy algorithms, partner xml feed integration, data analysis and
metrics, administrative tools and  a variety of new features and
enhancements. Our systems have been with scalability in mind, so the
successful candidate must demonstrate experience and ability to write
scalable code to be run in distributed environments.

Adzuna has been founded and recently launched by two experienced web
entrepreneurs who have built three multi-million revenue companies in the
last 5 years with similar business models, are developer-friendly, and have
extensive expertise in marketing and monetisation of these businesses.	It
is funded by experienced business angels and a venture capital fund.  The
initial focus is on the UK, but we expect to expand internationally
rapidly.  To find out more about us visit http://jobs.adzuna.co.uk

Initially the role may be on a contract basis at market competitive salary,
however there is the opportunity for this to become a full time role and to
earn an equity stake in the business over time. 

Location is at our office in central London.  Flexibility can be discussed.

Required skills:
•	Very good Object-Oriented Perl
•	Apache, fastcgi
•	mysql
•	SOLR or other search engine
•	Attention to detail
•	multi-box/multi-environment system configuration

Desired skills:
•	Experience with templating frameworks (ideally Template Toolkit)
•	Spidering technology
•	Catalogue / feeds management
•	Search engine optimisation
•	Classified ads / vertical search websites
•	Cloud services integration (eg AWS)
•	gearman or other distributed job-dispatching mechanisms
