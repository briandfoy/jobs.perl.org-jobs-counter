About Yahoo!

Think about impacting 1 out of every 2 people online--in innovative and
imaginative ways that are uniquely Yahoo!. We do just that each and every
day, and you could too. After all, it's big thinkers like you who will
create the next generation of Internet experiences for consumers and
advertisers across the globe. Now's the time to show the world what you've
got. Put your ideas to work for over half a billion people.

About Business group or Product:
Yahoo!'s Developer Tools Team provides productivity solutions to thousands
of employees in every Yahoo! location worldwide.  Our tools portfolio
includes open-source and homemade systems covering everything from defect
and source-code management, through build systems, and on to packaging and
deployment.  We also manage a large internal documentation system and
provide language platform infrastructure, specifically in Perl and Java.

Our customers are thousands of internal developers, service engineers, QA
engineers and project managers.  We support deployment to hundreds of
thousands of hosts, and have some of the largest developer databases in the
world.	If you're interested in working in large-scale streamlined
engineering solutions, the Yahoo! Developer Tools Team is the place to be.
We're a medium-sized team that continues to grow rapidly.  We have a strong
commitment to open source software, both as consumers and contributors.

Job Responsibilities:
We're now looking to hire a top-notch developer to work on our next
generation deployment tools.  You'll be building systems that need to
support deployment profiles as small as a few individual hosts up to very
large-scale infrastructure of 10^4, ^5 or ^6 real and virtual machines.

Most of our existing toolset is written in Perl, with some PHP and Java. 
Our database solution is usually MySQL but you should have strong
experience in memory-based caching solutions.  

You'll need to have worked on large-scale distributed systems, and have a
thorough understanding of network architecture and security needs

You must have demonstrated experience in scaleable, object-oriented design.
 You'll be passionate about delivering high-quality, maintainable code,
with a full test suite and with the appropriate documentation. 

===  Skills and Experience ===
The system you'll be building will be the backbone of Yahoo!'s deployment
infrastructure for many years to come.	We expect skills and experience
that match.
