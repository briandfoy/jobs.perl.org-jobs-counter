Description:
We need a perl programmer to work under me. I am the Project Manager and
lead perl programmer for the company. I have several to-do lists that the
company would like accomplished pretty fast. They have asked if I would
like to hire some one to work under me and help me accomplish all that I
have to do and then some. we can keep you busy. Here are what I will be
asking of the person we hire:

1) I will not have you login to the server or anything, but will ask you to
program everything as a module. If you can find a module already rogrammed
to use on Cpan, that would be fine if you can make it work for what we
need. For instance... I need a working module that can be kept up to do
what will utilize SOAP to communicate with UPS and USPS to calculate
postage on the fly. How I have this envisioned is that I will pass the
weight, dimensions, from zip and to zip to the module and you have the
module return to me a hash that has the name of the method and the price of
it. I will then present to them in the ecommerce the choices they will
have.

We can accomplish everything that way. What I need, you can build a module
for it and then I can access it that way.

Required skills:
Perl (for a unix machine)
MySQL
SOAP

Desired skills:
ASP.NET
Oracle
