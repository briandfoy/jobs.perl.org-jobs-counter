Job title:
Internal Systems Developer: Linux, Apache, Mysql, Perl

Company name: SmoothWall Ltd

Location: United Kingdom, West Yorkshire, Leeds

Pay rate: negotiable - dep. on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Internal Systems Developer:
SmoothWall is a rapidly growing software development company with offices
in the UK & US. Many of our internal systems - licencing, etc. are built on
a LAMP platform. 

We are currently looking for a developer to work closely with our sales and
accounts teams to improve, update, and generally maintain these internal
systems.

This job would suit both the "first job" and "couple of years experience"
scenarios, and you'd be working alongside experienced developers who can
show you the nuances of the existing systems.

There's tons of scope for doing things "right" and making a real
difference, without too much management in the way! We also actively
encourage our colleagues to get/stay involved in Open Source development.

Required skills:
Perl5, including DBI, CGI.pm
SQL, preferably MySQL
HTML/Javascript

Desired skills:
Linux/Apache admin
All that "Web2.0" stuff I am too old to learn ;)
