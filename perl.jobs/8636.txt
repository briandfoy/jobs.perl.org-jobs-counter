Job title: Object-Oriented Perl Superstars Needed

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Pay rate: $70k-$90K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of our time
writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback loops speak
louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings. We
practice
test-driven development and have a comprehensive suite of tests. We pair
program, so you'll learn the system quickly and have a great time doing it.
We have short release cycles, which means your talents
won't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of day.
Software you write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a
couple of weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP
project in the
industry (six years and counting), so we have gotten quite good at
embracing XP's advantages while avoiding its pitfalls.

I work hard for eight hours solving challenging problems, and then go home
to lead a well balanced life outside
of work.  When I'm at work I get to interact closely with a group that is
brilliant, funny, motivated, and inspiring.I spend most of the day
smiling,laughing, and learning.  The team we've built is truly a special
group, and I'm proud and honored to be a part of it.

We build network management software that is used by many of the leading IT
organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major universities,hospitals, and
other prominent institutions. Our industry-leading software helps
plan, configure, manage, and monitor some of the largest wireless networks
on the planet.


Required skills:
* Object-oriented programming
 * Strong refactoring and design ability


Desired skills:
* Perl or other dynamic language like Ruby, JavaScript, Lisp or Scheme
 * Experience developing automated tests
 * Apache mod_perl
 * Basic SQL (PostgreSQL experience a plus)
 * Experience with agile software development
 * Linux application development
 * Knowledge of TCP/IP and 802.11 wireless networking
