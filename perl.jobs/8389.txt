Job title:
Pobox.com - Programmer, Research & Development

Company name: IC Group

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're looking for a new programmer.  You might know us as Pobox.com or
Listbox.com; we've been around since before the Internet was cool,
offering all kinds of email-related services.  Email is our life's
blood, so you'll need to know email, but we also do a lot of work with
web applications and web services, automated testing, job queueing, and
whatever other problems crop up along the way.

We're a small company located in center city Philadelphia.  You'll need to
live
nearby and come into the office a couple times a week -- but it's a pretty
comfortable and casual office, so don't panic.

We like open source; it runs our business.  As much as possible, we try
to write our code so that we can release it -- it's easier to write good
code when you know other people will see it.

Feel free to sign up for a trial account of either service to see more
about what we do.

Required skills:
  * proficiency with Perl, including OO
  * proficiency with how email works
  * proficiency with relational databases, the Perl DBI
  * proficiency with working in a unix environment
  * experience using an ORM (preferably DBIx::Class or Class::DBI)
  * experience coding for the web, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  * proximity to Philadelphia (or willingness to move here)

Desired skills:
  * familiarity with
    * Moose
    * Catalyst
    * jQuery
    * Mason
  * experience with the Postfix MTA
  * experience with PHP and/or Python
