Job title: Integration Engineer

Company name: OANDA

Internal ID: 10490

Location: Canada, Ontario, Toronto

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
OANDA is a unique company.  It's not a Web upstart or a bank.  It’s a
technology company that innovates both in computer engineering and
financial modeling for the Foreign Currency Exchange Trade market.  OANDA
has experienced continued growth since its founding in 1996, and
opportunities for employees remain unprecedented as the company creates new
products that redefine the forex market.  With a daily capitalization of $3
trillion, the forex market dwarfs both the US bond and equity markets. 

What's at the root of OANDA's success?	The Employees.	As an employee you
will constantly develop innovative technology in an almost lab-like
environment.  You will develop and challenge your skills every day.  You
will have the ability to be self-directed in your work within a
collaborative team structure.  You’ll enjoy the immediacy of a small
company, but use the most advanced tools/technologies that a large firm can
offer.	And to maintain that community feel at OANDA we offer flexibility &
sociability with things like catered lunches, on-site massage therapists,
Friday @ 4 gatherings and more.  You will contribute to the growth and
direction of OANDA, and your contributions to the success of the company
will be recognized and rewarded.  Located in downtown Toronto, the OANDA
development office provides convenient access to public transit and other
downtown amenities.

At OANDA the Integration Engineer can be described as an Architect, System
Administrator, Developer, and QA – all in one role.  This is a person who
is passionate about the big picture since every decision is made by taking
into account what would be best for the whole system.  The Integration
Engineer is someone who takes a holistic approach to technology and is
excited about tackling issues that pose a multi-layered challenge.

Being an Integration Engineer means that you are involved early in the
design process to give a holistic perspective.	You are the gatekeeper of
the entire development process.  In order to understand what is happening
in the system you need to well versed in Perl since that is the primary
language used throughout the system.  You will look for ways that the
infrastructure might fail, as well as ways to optimize the system.  You
will do light feature testing to ensure that new/upgraded code doesn’t
interrupt existing resources.  As well - all Integration development work
is written in Perl so expertise in this area is necessary.  You work
closely with others and help guide them to the most appropriate solutions. 
Essentially you are a key member of a team that ensures OANDA’s continued
success.

The Integration Engineer is also an excellent role to get a complete
understanding of all the technology positions in both the Development and
Operations parts of OANDA.  This allows for a wide range of continued
career growth opportunities within the company and beyond.


Required skills:
•	A University degree in computer science, computer engineering, or a
related field.
•	Demonstrated knowledge, passion and experience (either professional
or personal) of system architecture including communication protocols,
intra-system dependencies, hardware and software configuration.
•	Extensive experience with UNIX / Linux / Solaris operating systems.

•	Extensive development experience using Perl and mod Perl.
•	Sound knowledge of Object Oriented Programming concepts.
