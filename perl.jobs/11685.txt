Description:
Senior Software Engineer
Direct hire opportunity with one of our clients. The purpose of the Senior

components of the company's web-based technology. The company is seeking a
number of Senior Software Engineers to join their team. The purpose of the
Senior Software Engineer role is to design, build and maintain critical
components of their technology. Your first 12 months will be exciting.
During that time you may have: 
•	Created new features that help students learn more effectively;
•	Designed an API to support new integrations;
•	Improved the testability of our application;
•	Mentored less-experienced team members;
•	Contributed to improvements to our Agile process.
•	(And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.)
They are searching for multiple Senior Software Engineers. The successful
candidates will bring with them extremely solid software engineering
fundamentals, as well as unique experience solving specific types of
problems.
The Duties
• Write high-quality software as a member of an Agile team.
• Accurately estimate and plan the work necessary to build a new feature or
component.
• Analyze complex business problems and determine the best technological
solution.
• Collaborate with fellow developers, test analysts, designers and product
managers.
• Drink free beer (or another frosty beverage of your choice) every
Thursday afternoon.

Required skills:
The Fundamentals
Any successful candidate will have most of the following:
•	Ability to improve the testability of our application. (This
includes the basics of automated unit and functional testing, along with
the ability to refactor non-tested portions of our application to make them
testable.)
•	Significant experience with Object-Oriented programming with Perl. 

•	An in-depth understanding of design patterns. (For example, you
should feel remarkably comfortable with: Model-View-Controller, Gateway,
Façade, Singleton, and Factory Method design patterns.)
•	Experience with MySQL (or another RDBMS).
•	Techniques for solving problems in a high-volume, always-available
environment.
•	A history with modern browsers and supporting technologies (such as
CSS 2 & 3, XHTML, HTML5, Ajax, and Javascript frameworks).
•	In-depth experience with multiple server-side languages, such as
Java, Perl, PHP, Ruby, etc.
•	A strong desire to be a part of a cross-functional development
team.
•	A passion for automating just about everything, but especially
testing, packaging and deploying.

The Qualifications
Successful candidates will likely have the following:
•	At least 7 years of software development, preferably with a
web-based, Software-as-a-Service application.
•	A passing familiarity with Agile software development.
•	A bachelor’s degree (a master’s is a plus) in Computer Science,
Computer Engineering or related field.
•	A passion for helping teachers teach and students learn.

Desired skills:
The Distinctives
Having a history with and passion for one or more of the following will set
you apart from the pack:
•	Designing, building and testing RESTful APIs.
•	Improving the performance of an application with technologies such
as Memcache and Beanstalkd.
•	Mentoring other developers.
•	Serving on cross-team committees that establish and promote solid
engineering standards.
•	Using NoSQL to store and retrieve lots of data. Technologies such
as MongoDB, Hadoop, BigTable, and Cassandra should ring a bell.
•	Writing advanced Javascript and/or contributing to Javascript
frameworks such as Jquery or Dojo.
•	Building software under a continuous integration model.
•	An in-depth understanding of Agile development. (For instance, you
might know the answer to “How are team commitments different in a Scrum
culture than they are in a Kanban culture?”)
