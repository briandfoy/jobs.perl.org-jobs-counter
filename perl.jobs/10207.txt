Job title:
Scientific Perl Programmer - High Throughput Gene Targeting

Company name: Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute

Internal ID: 80336

Location: United Kingdom, Cambridge

Pay rate: 27.3k - 37.6k p/a

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 2.5 years

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We do software support for three high-profile scientific projects, doing ES
Cell mutagenesis at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

We are pragmatic in the technologies we use, and we work closely with our
lab’s molecular biologists to make our software effective. For this reason,
we are only interested in an on-site employee (i.e. no remote work).

Our software ranges from plate-tracking to sequence analysis to data marts,
often with Ajax-driven web front ends. Some of our software is deployed
here: 
<url>http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt </url>
and here: 
<url>http://www.knockoutmouse.org/martsearch</url>

Required skills:
You should be proficient in object-oriented Perl programming over
relational databases, and have a good working knowledge of SQL.

Desired skills:
A working knowledge of other OO languages and frameworks used in
server-side development (e.g. Ruby, Rails) would be welcome. If you have
experience with server-side frameworks (such as Catalyst and Template
Toolkit), and / or Javascript toolkits (such as Prototype or JQuery), this
would be an advantage. A qualification in Biological computing is not
essential but an interest in the science and willingness to learn fast is
key. The campus runs frequent courses to allow staff to augment their
technical skills.
