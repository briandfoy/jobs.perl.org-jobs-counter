Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: DR MyCommerce

Location: Minneapolis, MN, United States

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a junior to mid-level Software Engineer.

We're part of a publicly traded company with more than 1400 employees
located just outside of Minneapolis. Our group is a smaller subset called
MyCommerce, focused on small and medium businesses, with an agile and fast
paced development process. As a part of this larger organization, we can
offer perks such as an on-site fitness center, full service cafeteria,
parking, casual dress, tuition reimbursement, employee referral program,
domestic partner benefits, a 401k plan, employee stock purchase program,
medical/dental/vision/life insurance, PTO, and paid holidays.

As a member of the development team for an e-commerce web application, you
will design, code, and unit test new features and modifications. As a
software engineer, you must be willing to help define technical
requirements based on business needs while implementing solutions. You will
be expected to implement projects in a timely manner, in conformance with
coding standards and in compliance with defined specifications. You should
be able to consistently follow existing patterns and implement new ones
when appropriate.

We're looking for someone with some reasonable Perl experience, but we
aren't looking for a language loyalist. We have a team of developers with
widely different backgrounds and language knowledge, and we're willing to
try new things as long as they work, they're robust, and they're scalable.
The core platform is written in Modern Perl (Catalyst, Moose, DBIx::Class,
and more), but new services could be built in different languages, and we'd
like you to be open to it.

Responsibilities:

 - Design, code, and unit test new features and modifications
 - Implement projects in a timely manner in conformance with coding
standards and in compliance with defined specifications
 - Triage, refactor, and troubleshoot issues found within the codebase
 - Communicate effectively in a fast paced work environment
 - Develop robust, reliable, well-tested software

Required skills:
- B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent experience
 - 3+ years software development experience
 - 2+ years object oriented analysis and design
 - 2+ years programming experience in Perl
 - 1+ years programming experience in another object oriented language,
such as Java, C#, Python, or Ruby
 - 2+ years SQL experience, Oracle preferred
 - 2+ years developing in a Unix/Linux environment
 - 1+ years experience in ORM or persistence frameworks such as
DBIx::Class, Hibernate, or ActiveRecord
 - 1+ years experience in Catalyst, Mojolicious, or another major MVC web
framework
 - 1+ years experience in Git or another version control system
 - Experience with HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS
 - Experience with AJAX, JSON, and API interaction
 - Experience building web applications in an object oriented development
environment

 - Excellent written and verbal skills
 - Comfort with a fast paced environment
 - Proven record in delivering results in complex development projects
 - Ability to translate business requirements into a technical design that
can be understood and implemented by a cross functional team
 - Can take several assignments at the same time and manage development
activities according to priorities and schedules
