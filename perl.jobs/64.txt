We're looking for a creative self-starter to help support and

firewalls/iptables)
- Database administration, especially PostgreSQL
- High Availability systems (Linux/HA, LVS, UltraMonkey, file/db
replication)
- Cross-browser Javascript
- XML/XSL
- vi ;-)

Your responsibilities will include a combination of system
configuration at our DC area colocation facility and perl module
development at our Washington DC office to support existing and
create new functionality in our product line.
