Job title:
Integration of VideoConferencing Software with our Site's User Management
System (login system)

Company name: www.ustrippoker.com

Location: online, online, online

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: as needed it

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We're looking for CGI/PERL programmer who can help us integrate
CamFrogWeb's video conferencing software
with our site's user management system (login system)


Our site uses customized vesrion of BAC software for our backend, see 
www.buildacommunity.com


video chat software we license :
http://www.camfrogweb.com/
(see attched file "programmer's guide to the integration of camfrogweb")


Here is the detailed description of the script's requirement:

-We have licensed a videoconferencing software (camfrogweb active X
Control) that needs to be integrated with our site's logon and password
system.

-Our goal is to integrate video chat room into our site so that our members
would not have to login twice (first time ... to the site, second time...
to the videochat).

-The videochat software will be hosted on a separate server we lease from
EV1Servers.Net
- The Camfrog software will be installed by camfrog programmers on
EV1Servers.Net server.
- The Camfrog software will be hosted on a Windows 2003 server but our web
page can run on buildacommunity.com's server (unix)
- The script that you write should help CamfrogWeb software recognize who
is

1) free member (Privilege Group 0 )
2) premium member (Privilege Group 3)
3) free member who paid an entrance fee to participate in "pay-per-play"
game (Privilege Group 5)


Three above mentioned statuses can be determined depending on what
directory the members are using to access the Camfrogweb's videochat
software. 
Therefore, we should have 3 directories:

1) www.oursite.com/free-directory for free members
2) www.oursite.com/premium-directory for premium members (monthly paid)
3) www.oursite.com/pay-per-play-games-directory for free members while
they're playing a "pay-per-play" game.

-People coming from www.oursite.com/free-directory will have a "time-out"
video features (camfrogweb's configuration is adjustable)

-People coming from www.oursite.com/premium-directory will have no
limitations on video features, 100% access to all features, all the time.
(camfrogweb's configuration is adjustable)

-People coming from www.oursite.com/pay-per-play-games-directory will have
no "video time-out" limitations while they're playing a pay-per-play game
(for the duration of the PPP game).

When a free member pays an entrance fee for the ppp game your script would
have to temporarily move that player (username) from
www.oursite.com/free-directory to 
www.oursite.com/pay-per-play-games-directory . That player will be in
www.oursite.com/pay-per-play-games-directory for the duration of the PPP
game. When the game is over or shortly after your script would have to move
him back to www.oursite.com/free-directory.

Basically the script upon the confirmation of payment via ccbill.com and/or
paypal.com moves a free member from one privileged group (group zero) to
another privilege group (group 5).

Our goal is to allow free members - who normally have a restricted use of
video feed - to have a full 100% use of video-feed during the PPP game for
which they paid an entrance fee. Once the ppp game is over your script 
should move them back to www.oursite.com/free-directory which allows them a
restricted use of video (video feed times out in 60 seconds; this is
configured via camfrogweb settings).
