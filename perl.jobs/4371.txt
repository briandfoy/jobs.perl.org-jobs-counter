Perl Web Applications Development
 
We provide over 300 of America’s most successful retailers and catalogers
with rich media applications for their online channel. We are the leading
player in our rapidly growing market segment. Our continuing success is
based on superior technology and innovation.

As we continue to grow rapidly we plan to strengthen our R&D team and look

Position will include design,  coding, implementation, and delivery of our
Web ASP platform. The Perl developer for Web Applications will work with a
team of 4 - 5 developers 

Each of our rich media applications follows a common design methodology. We
take existing visual content (images, catalogs, video) and optimize it for
online purposes through the addition of interactivity, animation and
integration with standard e-commerce components like shop systems, site
metrics, site search etc. All our rich media presentations are top-notch
client-server web applications used by millions of consumers. They are
automatically generated by our proprietary set of rich-media generation
tools, embedded in our Web ASP platform. 

 We are located in New York City, and offer a competitive compensation
package including bonus. We have outstanding benefits for all employees,
including top-rated health, dental, and vision coverage, as well as
vacation, flexible holidays and 401(k) plans.


Required skills:
Requirements for the position are:

·At least 5+ years of hands-on experience in designing, coding, and
implementation of enterprise-level web applications.

·Familiarity with both back-end and front-end web technologies. Explicit
hands-on development experience with Perl, on Linux and Apache is a MUST.
In addition equivalent experience with either .NET, or, J2EE is a plus.

·Proven development abilities in a demanding, fast-paced, rapidly evolving
environment.

·Experience with large storage systems, and large hosting facilities.
 
·Prior experience with imaging and/or publishing systems is a plus.

·A team player with excellent communication skills.
