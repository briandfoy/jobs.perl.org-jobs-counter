Job title:
Science background, or a passing interest in life sciences?
Junior/mid-level Perl developer

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Excellent

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Friendly and quiet office in London (W1) looking for a Perl (or similar)
developer with at least two years experience. You're expected to have
fullstack experience/abilities, from improvements on the client's HTML
front-end to backend services. It's a small company, so there's some
fluidility expected between roles - a good place to expand on your
jack-of-all-software-trades skillset.

Client builds a popular software
product range for life sciences research. Any bioinformatic experience
would be an advantage, but an interest in moving into this area would do in
a pinch.
