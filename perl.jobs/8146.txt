Job title:
perl engineer for mobile site integrations

Company name: MoMac

Internal ID: SEPO

Location: Netherlands, Zuid, Rotterdam

Pay rate: 40 euro/hour

Travel: 50-75%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
Within our software development department we have temporarily a need for
extra perl developer. Within this year we expect to execute a number of
small and larger projects like:
-	Further integration of payment and identification system for UK
portals
-	Set-up & integration of mail functionality in mobile sites 
-	Extension of advertising integration in mobile sites 
-	Set up and extending new content feeds (RSS, XML) 
-	Aid at the migration of platform components to new hardware 
-	… more project can be defined in time as business requires..

Some projects are small and can be done in a matter of days, other projects
are larger and can take up to 3 months.

We expect some good knowledge of perl, we also use perl in a object
oriented way where most of our mobile sites and integrated (server side)
applications are build within our framework. Besides perl knowledge we also
expect some knowledge of open source components such as Apache, MySQL and
Linux. 

We prefer to build a good relation with one freelance worker as some
knowledge will be required of our development, test and production
environment and perl frameworks in order to develop solutions.
Such knowledge can be reused then in subsequent projects.

We prefer native Dutch speaking workers, but (good spoken and written)
English is an viable alternative. 

We require, especial at startup of the relation, on site availability in
our office in Rotterdam. Much of our development is Agile and requirements
alter frequent and are discussed in face2face meetings with our technical
oriented project managers. Off site work will be allowed once, we have a
good feeling on the scope of the project and can make very clear agreements
on the deliverables, test results, support during testing and deadlines.

We do not want intermediate agencies to respond to this request.

Our hour tariff will be max. 40 euro/hour.

We will not reimburse costs such as travel, location/stay costs.


Required skills:
2-3 years of perl development
Object orientation in perl
understanding of Apache, Linux, MySQL

Desired skills:
deeper insight in perl, cpan, mod/perl and the technical architecture
Apache, MySQL, and Linux. 

Also some of our components are also written in PHP so some PHP skills are
a plus.
