Job title:
Short-Term E-Commerce Perl/JavaScript Project Needs Finishing

Company name: The Purple Store

Location: Seattle, WA, United States

Pay rate: (negotiable)

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 1-2 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
U.S.-based developers only, please.

We have a project that two friends helped on and nearly got done before
each got too busy with their day gig projects.	It's pretty close to done
and could use some help wrapping up from another developer.

The Purple Store has been around for nine years online
(www.thepurplestore.com) and now has a retail store in Seattle.  Yes,
everything we sell is purple. We cater to purple fans, carrying
men's/women's clothing, furniture, jewelry, kitchen, electrical tape, etc.


We expect this to take 5-15 hours depending on experience (and perhaps how
quickly you tend to code and get things done). 

Location:		Seattle (Greenlake/Fremont) though work can be done
off-site.  We prefer someone locally based in the Seattle area but can make
this a telecommute if you have references saying you're awesome.

We need someone to finish an e-commerce payment steps flow to integrate
with PayPal's back-end for thepurplestore.com.	Major bits are done; it
needs final a few more features and testing.

Timeframe:	Soon.  This or next week if possible.

Time Needed:	From what we understand, it's about 3-4 real Perl coding
hours remaining for the basics on this and a few extra hours for some other
features if we can get to them, plus a bit of handoff time to get familiar
with what's in the code.

Assets: 	We have a Perl conversant project lead (having built part
of the less-pretty parts of the code) who can be a reference.  Both
previous devs would be available to explain what the heck they did, so you
wouldn't be in the dark.

A Few Details:
We're hoping to redo the front-end of our website soon and will be
improving the back-end at the same time.  Our current code is Perl +
Postgresql and we'll either be improving that and adding some missing
features (accounts, etc.) or ditching it for some open source or other cart
system.

In the meantime, our checkout payment approach is stupid.  It sends the
customer off-site to PayPal, sometimes returning them after payment, and
scares a lot of non-PayPal users away.	We can't afford to redo the website
until we boost some cash and that means bringing the payment system
on-site.  This will both improve conversions and let us measure
pay-per-click conversions so we can improve the ads we're running.

You'd need to look over what's there, activate a few features done but not
being triggered, and add two or three more things (such as an API for
address verification) if they're not yet in there. Most of the PayPal
integration, we believe, is already done.   Then our staff would help with
testing and you'd debug.

While we can't afford a ton right now this is a priority for us so we'd
like to pay someone (rather than have a friend do it when they can) a
reasonable amount so they can prioritize it.  Again, we will be hiring
someone based in the U.S. and not abroad.

Please let us know if you or someone you love would fit this and what your
background and skill levels are.  We're happy to work out project and
compensation details together.

If things go well, we may have some add-on features for this or other Perl
projects periodically.

For e-mail your reply, including a quick description of your background and
(candid) assessment of your Perl and JavaScript skills.

Required skills:
-- Really solid Perl
-- Decent JavaScript/AJAX for a few small steps
-- Good API/CGI sense
-- A mind for tight security development, as these are payment steps
-- Ease at communicating how things are going and working together toward
the best end result.

Desired skills:
-- Background in CSS and mobile layout development is a plus for phase II,
making the payment steps mobile responsive or adaptive.

-- Familiarity with PostgreSQL wouldn't hurt, though we have already built
most sql commands for this.
