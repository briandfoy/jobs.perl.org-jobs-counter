Job title: Perl Web App Development (MRTG and DNS Management)

Company name: Quonix

Location: Philadelphia, PA

Pay rate: Based on estimate

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
High Level Description

We are looking for a telecommute perl developer to
build from scratch a customer facing web GUI to allows client to view their
MRTG bandwidth usage graphs and make changes to their forward and reverse
DNS.

We have an existing system in place, but it is very limited. The only
salvageable piece is the Mysql database that has all the client info
(logins, forward domains, reverse zones, which interfaces belong to them).
So the database portion is effectively good to go, but you have to develop
a new front end.

Details

The DNS data lives on the filesystem in BIND
syntax. So forward domains are simply stored at /etc/bind/master/domain.com
and the file itself contains all the MX, A, CNAME records, etc.,. The
reverse zone is tricky, it lives at /etc/bind/master/5.6.7.in-addr.arpa and
that file controls the reverse DNS for 7.6.5.0/24. But most of our clients
have subnets smaller then a /24, so that file is shared across multiple
clients. The database contains entries for the forward domains that a
certain user has rights to, and for the reverse the database contains all
the IPs the user has rights to. For example, if a user is assigned the
subnet 7.6.5.0/30, then the database would have the IPs 7.6.5.2 and 7.6.5.3
in it. Keep in mind alot of this is open to redesign. One option is we
store all reverse data in the mysql database, then have a cron job that
"builds" the .arpa zone files every hour.

The MRTG data is alot easier to
interface with. A given client has an interface assigned to them, this is
in the database. The graphs for that interface can be fetched via a static
http get request, so that graph just needs to be wrapped and displayed.

Desired skills:
Web front end experience, perl, mysql, BIND DNS, IP and subnet knowledge,
and MRTG/RTG.
