Job title: HeadForwards Perl Development roles x 3

Company name: HeadForwards

Internal ID: roles-x-3

Location: UK, Cornwall, Pool

Pay rate: Varied; up to £50k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are excited to be able to offer 3 new Perl Developer opportunities
within an established and expanding scrum team. Perl development experience
is the most important attribute of candidates applying (C and C++
experience would also be considered). If you have experience of working in
an Agile software team as well, even better, but not essential.

Within a scrum framework you will be part of a team whose job it is to
understand user requirements, design solutions, and develop and test
multi-tier implementations to address the requirements.

Our preference is to employ successful candidates as permanent employees
(although contract employment can also be offered).

Please only apply if you are eligible to live and work in the UK.

Required skills: Perl

Desired skills:
OO Perl
CPAN
SQL (any flavours)
Web front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery)
Web protocols e.g. HTTP
PostgreSQL
Source/Version Control systems and practices (preferably Git)
Experience of Scrum / Agile
Python
Unit Testing
