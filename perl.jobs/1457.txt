Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Plus Three recognizes the inherent relationship between Strategy, Design +
Technology in today's evolving market and delivers integrated solutions
that effectively communicate across all media. Plus Three works in the
political, non-profit, telecommunication, financial and publishing
industries.

Our clients include the Democratic National Committee, Democratic GAIN, the
United Federation of Teachers, and John Kerry for President.

We need a senior Perl programmer to lead development in our Washington,
D.C. office. We are building complex, high-traffic web sites using open
source software, including GNU/Linux, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL and
XML::Comma.


Required skills:
    * Demonstrable programming ability and experience with Perl, including
OO design, effective use of the CPAN, and familiarity with modern web
development tools like mod_perl and templating systems.
    * A broad knowledge of Internet technology, and a desire to find things
out empirically rather than rely on conjecture (i.e. someone who is not
afraid to telnet to port 80).
    * A desire to plan for the future with suitable programming
abstractions, automated test suites & version control, and generally feel
in control of your own destiny.
    * Expressive verbal and written communications skills. Direct
interaction with clients will be involved.
