Job title:
Perl coder/maintainer for Internet Exchange IP-aware tools

Company name: LINX

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month renewable to 3 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
This contract is to carry out some maintenance and refinement work on some
internal scripts and home-grown software that forms part of our network
monitoring and management toolset, mostly written in Perl and using Perl
modules.

The work will consist of a code review of the existing software, followed
by maintenance of the code to achieve two things - addition of some new
features and improve the ease of future maintenance. There will also be a
need to document the work you have done and hand it over.

The position is nominally based in London, UK, with but with agreed
telecommuting acceptable.

Required skills:
Excellent spoken and written English
Proven experience in programming for LAMP based infrastructures
UNIX system administration skills
Understanding of IP networking, with IPv6 experience advantageous
Demonstrate thorough knowledge and experience of solving problems using
scripting languages - Perl essential!
Previous software maintenance experience - Involving the adoption and
maintenance of other developers' work
Producing documentation for software deployments
Using revision control systems such as SVN, RCS, etc., to manage software
evolution and maintenance in a collaborative environment
Experience with network monitoring and measurement software an advantage -
e.g. syslog, MRTG, RRD databases, sFlow, NetFlow, etc.

"Coding Challenge"
You should be able to indicate multiple examples of openly available Perl
programs you have written which:
a) Have been accepted into recognised open source software repositories
such as CPAN, and
b) Are clearly documented, and
c) Are regularly maintained, where maintenance is appropriate.

You are also required to have the right to live and work in the UK.
