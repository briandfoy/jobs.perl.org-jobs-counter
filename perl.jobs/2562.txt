Job title: mod_perl developer

Company name: CheetahMail, an Experian company

Internal ID: perl

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: US $$$

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking mostly for people with unix/linux background, with expert
knowledge of C and/or Perl, ideally mod_perl programming. They should be
interested in working in a "the buck stops here" environment, i.e. there is
nothing that's broken that isn't our responsibility to fix and that we
can't fix. We have all the source code since we use open-source and
in-house developed software only (with the exception of Oracle). In
discussions, there is no "X says so", but rather an idea or a way of doing
things has to be explained so that others based on common sense can be
convinced. Little specialization, lots of discussion/learning. 


Required skills:
We work a lot with Oracle. Basic SQL is a must, and more experience,
especially Oracle, is desirable. 
expert knowledge of C and/or Perl, ideally mod_perl programming
