Job title: Developer

Company name: athenahealth

Location: MA, watertown

Pay rate: 50-100K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Who are we? 
We are a 400+ person rapidly-growing software/services company dedicated to
improving the lives of practicing physicians in the U.S.  We are one of the
few successful companies focused on making medical offices run more
efficiently. Our co-founders, Todd Park (Economics, Magna Cum Laude,
Harvard '93) and Jonathan Bush (HBS '98) both helped to found the managed
care consulting practice at Booz Allen & Hamilton.  We have won multiple #1
awards, enjoy revenues of $80+ million per year, and we're just getting
started.  

Why would you want to work here? 
We hire the best of the best: software developers, business analysts,
implementation consultants. If you're looking at Oracle/Microsoft/Google or
McKinsey/Bain/BCG, you'll feel right at home here.  Our product development
branch includes many alumni from Harvard and MIT, as well as former
professors from U. Chicago and Northeastern, a Rand Institute statistician,
and other smart folks who took the road less traveled.	We were also voted
one of the best places to work in Massachusetts by Boston Business Journal
(http://athenahealth.com/Home/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/BBJBestPlaces2005
/).  

In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of DHTML, CSS, and
JavaScript thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we
believe any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of
a couple of months or so. We're more interested in folks with raw talent
and a burning desire to succeed.  

If interested, please send a resume and a solution to the following puzzle.


You and a friend are about to eat a pizza. You know that it always takes
you x seconds to eat a unit of pizza, and you know it takes your friend y
seconds. Once the pizza is cut, you will both start eating at the same
time. Each person can eat only one slice at a time. You cannot touch the
next piece until you finish the one you're eating. Out of generosity, you
have agreed in advance to allow your friend to have the last slice if you
should both happen to reach for it at the same time. Assuming that you
would like as much of the pizza as possible to end up in your stomach, into
how many equal-sized slices should you cut the pizza?
