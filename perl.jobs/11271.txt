Job title:
Perl Web developer for data-heavy MySQL application 

Company name: ChannelMeter

Internal ID: Dev1

Location: USA , CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: Negotiable (USD)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent 

Hours: Full time

Description:
Are you a smart, hungry Perl web dev?	Want to be employee #1 at a funded
startup doing YouTube analytics?  We'll give you a moderate salary, great
equity, and a whole lot of responsibility. We'll expect brilliance,
motivation, blood, sweat, and tears. 

Preference will be given to San Francisco Bay Area residents.  We will
consider telecommuters who are no more than 3 time zones away PROVIDED THEY
ARE US CITIZENS / HAVE A GREEN CARD.

Why take this job?  We've just launched version 2, we've done no marketing
and we've already got hundreds of customers and major corps asking to sign
up, and videos about us are popping up on YouTube. 


Required skills:
- Expert-level Perl

- Experience with an ORM (ideally DBIx::Class), a templating engine
(ideally TT), and a MVC web framework (ideally Catalyst)

- US citizen or green card

- Fluent written and spoken English

- As stated above, preference will be given to San Francisco Bay Area
residents.  We will consider telecommuters who are no more than 3 time
zones away PROVIDED THEY ARE US CITIZENS / HAVE A GREEN CARD.

We care more about your character and learning speed than existing skills.
We can teach you Catalyst but not how to be smart or motivated. 

Desired skills:
Serious data management experience in MySQL, meaning:

- Determining appropriate indices and caching strategies for tables with
millions of rows and >1M rows added daily 

- Optimizing website performance to serve data from said database with
sub-second response time.  

- Catalyst

- DBIC

- TT
