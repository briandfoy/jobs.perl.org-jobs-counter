Job title:
Telecommute: Perl developer for web publisher

Company name: Rapid Intelligence Pty Ltd

Internal ID: perljob04

Location: Anywhere, Telecommute

Pay rate: depends on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a Perl Programmer to help maintain and develop the
backends to our large-scale consumer websites (includes NationMaster.com
and exciting new sites).

We offer:
* Small, innovative team
* Opportunity to use diverse range of skills
* User focus. We're publishers. We have no clients!

Why work for us? We get over 12 million pageviews monthly, so everything
you do will hit the big time. Our mission is to make data accessible and
understandable for everyone around the world. And it should all be free! We
seek to build long term relationships with our staff and grow with them.
Most of our telecommute employees have been with us for 3+ years. If you
enjoy challenging and rewarding projects, this job is for you. And you can
have confidence in a solid business founded back in 2001. 

Pay: $1200 to $2000 / month depending on experience.

Required skills:
Successful candidates will have the following technical knowledge and
experience:
* Perl (at least 4 years). Must be comfortable with reading others' code,
regular expressions, OO, CPAN, etc. 
* Text processing
* Relational databases
* Web crawling

That's the technical side of things but your personality matters too. You
must have:
* Strong work ethic
* Desire to continually learn and improve
* Good communication skills in English
* Pragmatic approach
* Ability to work closely with other team members.

The headquarters of Rapid Intelligence is in Sydney Australia, so you must
work most of the time in Australian business hours. So this role is
suitable for Asians and Middle East/Eastern Europeans who work late at
night.	

Desired skills:
If you've got experience in any of the following areas, we'll like you even
more:
* Data mining
* MySQL 
* Text mining
* Natural language processing
* Version control 
* Statistics
* LARGE volumes of data 
* Distributed applications
* WikiMedia software
* Telecommuting
* Ad trafficking
* Analytics
* Writing
* Search engine optimisation
* Linux 
* Documentation
