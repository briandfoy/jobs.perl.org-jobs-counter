Job title: Anti-Spam Software Engineer

Company name: IronPort Systems

Location: United States, CA, San Bruno

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IronPort Systems is looking for an experienced server software engineer
with expertise in anti-spam and e-mail processing to help maintain and
extend our anti-spam and anti-virus offerings with services including
SpamCop, SenderBase, Virus Outbreak Filters, and Bonded Sender. 
As a part of our development team, you will be focused on maintaining and
improving anti-spam and anti-virus techniques. You will be developing from
specifications, testing code, and integrating your work into existing
services. 

We are looking for a person with strong communication skills and excellent
analytical skills. We need someone able to work on their own or within a
team to come up with workable and elegant solutions. You should be able to
give and receive feedback and be able to distill technical information and
prepare it so it can be delivered in a form that non-technical people can
readily understand. 
Development will be in Perl, Python, and MySQL on FreeBSD. You will own and
drive the engineering aspects of the projects you work on, which are
central to our corporate strategy. You will work with engineering and
operations team members to plan and improve scalability and operability of
our products. You will be part of a first-rate engineering organization and
must be ready to contribute. The ideal candidate will have a messaging
background and a firm understanding of issues currently facing mail
administrators in the field.

Why IronPort:
We have closed $50M in funding and have top-tier partners such as Symantec
(BrightMail), Sophos, and Microsoft. IronPort is a one of a kind
opportunity. You'll work with great people, exciting technologies, and help
run a cutting edge internet service. These skills will make you invaluable
now and in the future, but the opportunities at IronPort are so excellent
you won't want to go anywhere else.
