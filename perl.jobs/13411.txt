Job title:
Business & Technology Applications Analyst II - The Genome Institute -
25270

Company name: The Genome Institute at Washington University

Internal ID: 25270

Location: St. Louis, MO, USA

Pay rate: $56,222 to $73,091 annually

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Genome Institute at Washington University has an opening for a talented
software engineer in the Bioinformatics group.	The position will work with
an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting
the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large
scale genomic research projects.

The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its
inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as
the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects.
 The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of
genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of
the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at
understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease).	In
addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science
through various educational and outreach efforts.

Required skills:
Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or
college plus two years of relevant work experience required.  Additional
relevant programming experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis
for required education.

Desired skills:
The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is
interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production
environment.  The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a
regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers
across groups.	The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get
things done will find a lot of opportunity.

Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the
work.  Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture,
relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently,
which will require thorough knowledge of each concept.	The applicant will
use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people
and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a
compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the
specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.

Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.)
is a plus, but not required.  Understanding of relational databases and SQL
will be helpful.  Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS,
Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset.  Regular work
will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. 
Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as
git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.
