Job title: Junior SysAdmin – Large Linux cluster environment

Company name: DownUnder GeoSolutions

Location: Houston, Texas

Pay rate: USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Do you primarily run Linux on your desktop at home?

Does the thought of being a future SysAdmin of one of the worlds largest
cluster environments excite you?

If you’ve jumped out of your chair shouting YES to both those questions
then we should talk!

We are looking for an excited young person to join our team as a Junior
SysAdmin. You will come to us with a great knowledge of Linux from the long
hours spent tinkering with your own Linux systems. You’ll already be pretty
good at bash scripting and general Linux SysAdmin tasks, even if only in a
non-commercial capacity.

We are looking for someone young, someone that we can mold into our
practices and most importantly our culture here at DownUnder GeoSolutions.
What you will receive, along with a fantastic group of colleagues, is
pathway to being a full SysAdmin to one of the largest clusters in the
world!

As well as data room tasks associated with managing a large cluster, this
role includes desktop support of our 160+ internal users, predominately on
Linux platforms,but also includes some Windows and Mac desktops.

If this sounds like you, then what are you waiting for? Send us your
resume!

If your Linux exposure is primarily non-commercial and not obvious on your
resume, then outline your experience on a cover letter. Links to your
contributions to the Linux community in way for open source projects, forum
activity and Server Fault activity may assist with this.
