Subject: looking for telecommute work, or contract/permanent in Boston area
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: davedc@e-list.net (Dave Della Costa)

Hello, my name is Dave Della Costa.
I'm a web application developer/web master type looking
for Perl work, either contract work where I could telecommute,
or something in the Boston area.  I've got about 2.5 years
experience, and I mainly focus in technologies such as:
CGI.pm, Perl DBI (with MySQL mostly), Apache, mod_perl.

I'm currently an independent contractor, working primarily with
Harvard Business School and Dover Publications, but if 
a permanent position came up that was appealing I'd be 
interested.

If you've got something in mind but it doesn't seem like
I'm familiar with it, try me: I learn very quickly and I'm always
up for something new.

Check out my resume for more details:

Thanks very much!
-Dave D.
