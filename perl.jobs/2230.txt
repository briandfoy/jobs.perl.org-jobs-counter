Job title:
Very simple Perl script for order tracking

Company name: ATS

Location: Belgium, BW, Braine l'Alleud

Pay rate: best offer

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: few minutes...

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
I'm actually looking for a script I couldn't
find on the web

In order for my customers to track their orders, the script would open
a txt file looking like:


00001;we are preparing your order
00002;we are preparing your order
00003;your order has been shipped
00004;we are preparing your order
00005;we are waiting for your payment
00006......

The customer gives his order reference (field 1) in a "search" text
box, the script checks out the txt file and the page then returns
order status (field 2)- If order reference does not exist, page
returns for exemple "Order does not exist"

I also need it to work on my website:
How do I place this script in my html
page ? Do I have to create a .cgi file ? Cut & Paste in my page ??? What
about CHMOD ???

This answers have to be provided

I will choose best price offer (As the script is a few line, I just want to
spend very few money) 
Price & payment method to define (Credit card, paypal or if you are
interested in audio & light products, maybe can we find arrangement)

Required skills: perl, cgi, ... ?
