Description:
EMAIL SERVICE CHANGES
1. How the current service works
A user function within Mediasurface (Large Java based Content Management
package system) sends information from it to the 
Majordomo software running on one of the clients’s servers.

Editing options of email subscribers (subscription web site page)
- When a user adds or modifies their details on the subscription page, the 

Majordomo database of subscribers is altered.

Maintaining categories of email (Java client function)
- Through the Mediasurface Java client, we edit the navigation branches 
through which the different categories of emails are defined.

Defining a mail to be sent (Mediasurface field)
- Some (but not all) of the web content authored in Mediasurface includes 
the field ‘include in mailshot’. When published with this field set to 
‘yes’, a message is sent to Majordomo causing the URL of this item to be 
sent to the appropriate group(s) of users.

Reporting
- Majordomo sneds a weekly report of numbers of users subscribed.

2. Requirements for other facilities
We would like to be able to :
- modify the content of emails (including sending a newsletter comprising 
html);
- add new categories of subscription groups;
- modify the subject line and sender of the mail sent;
- maintain the subscriber base (e.g. to delete old categories of user);
- modify data capture to be able to gather and store more extensive info 
about
users when they subscribe;
- modify Majordomo report content and names it is sent to ;
- make further changes (as yet unspecified) more easily.


Required skills:
Perl, Majordomo, maybe some Mediasurface and Java
