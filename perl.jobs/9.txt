Subject: Perl Application Developer (F/T), Greenwich, CT (NYC Perl hackers should also take a look)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: leahandkc@mindspring.com ("Leah and K.C.")

We're looking for 2 Perl programmers with 3-5 years of experience to work at
our Financial Services company in beautiful Greenwich, CT.  We are a $550
million company that is 20 years old this year.  We have 600 employees, of
which 100 work in information technology.  We work primarily in government
securities, asset finance, securitization markets and in the provision of
high quality futures brokerage services.  We have a high energy, yet casual
office environment (dress), where entrepreneurial attitudes are rewarded.
There isn't a lot of hand holding, or looking over your shoulder, so we need
to have people that have a high degree of self sufficiency.  Through a
spirit of team work the firm has grown the company year in and year out.

These Perl application developers will work in our "mid office" group that
is responsible for various critical applications and projects such as
finance and credit applications, management reporting systems, etc.
Excellent Perl skills will be needed.  C++ and Java experience will also be
good to have.  You should have the ability to review, analyze and modify
programming systems including encoding, testing, debugging, and documenting
programs.  Heavy experiences in UNIX systems is a must, Sybase, Oracle, SQL
will be needed, but if you know one or the other you will be fine.

Compensation for this position is in a range of $80K to $110K, with the
opportunity to earn  a 20-25% annual bonus.  These bonuses can grow
substantially year to year based on performance.  In addition, there is
tuition reimbursement, matching 401K, and extensive health benefits.  Just a
note, we have many employees that live in NYC and take the train to
beautiful Greenwich everyday.  It's only a 35 minute ride on Metro-North to
Greenwich and we're located only 3 minutes from the train station.
