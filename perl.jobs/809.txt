Dear Recruiting Manager:

  I am a Java Developer/Architect that specializes in developing distributed e-commerce applications using Java and J2EE technologies.  I have experience in architecting and developing server side (EJB), client side (JSP/Swing), and standalone multithreaded applications.  I am also experienced in the tools that are needed to build and run these applications.

  I have more than 10 years experience in the computer industry.  I worked in many different computing environments.  I graduated from the University of California near the top of my class (3.93 GPA).  My professional and academic experience contribute to the applications that I build today.  I am able to build applications quickly, accurately, and efficiently because of my prior experience.

  Attached is my resume for your reference.  Samples of my work, including my resume, can be found at http://www.paulrowe.com.  An interview would give the opportunity to prove my strengths.

Respectfully yours,

Paul Rowe

P.S.  I am considering permanent and contract positions in New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, but I am willing to relocate anywhere in the U.S. if needed.

OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS

* Built internet gaming system that runs out of my house. This is an extensible system that illustrates my J2EE skills. This system is online @ http://www.paulrowe.com/game.cgi. The architecture of this program is described @ http://www.paulrowe.com/java_samples.html#chess.  This system runs on Tomcat, Jboss, MySQL and Linux.

* I wrote an NT screensaver that uses OpenGL and GLUT. This screensaver is a 3-d screensaver that similates orbits of planetary bodies. This program is described @ http://www.paulrowe.com/c_samples.html

* My skills at website construction (HTML/Javascript) are illustrated @ http://www.paulrowe.com

* Create JNI interface to WinRadio C++ driver. Wrote a series of Swing Applications to control the WinRadio. These applications use MySQL and JDBC for their persistence.  This program is further described at http://www.paulrowe.com/java_samples.html#winradioui.

* Improve upon the stress testing application that I built at TiVo.  Rewrite it so it is more object oriented and scalable.  Use this application to crawl websites in a spider like fashion.  This code relies heavily on HTML parsing, sockets and multithreading.

* Take the process scheduling application (QueueService) and rewrite it so it is more scalable, and even more robust.  Genericize this code so it can be used for other applications.  In addition to process scheduling, "Service" is now used for queued e-mail delivery and stress testing.
