Required skills:
Ideally looking for candidates with 2-3 years of experience. You do not
have to be superstar programmers that build highly complex applications in
Perl but you should not be non-programmer script writer types either. Must
be able to deal with the internal accounting group. communication skills
are important, as is the ability to interact with non-technical users. 

Desired skills:
Some accounting, money management,or bond knowledge is very helpful and
people with that experience are highly preferred.Lack of business knowledge
would not cause someone to be ruled out. Highly motivated applicants 
with good structured Perl programming skills and strong educational
backgrounds are OK, too.
