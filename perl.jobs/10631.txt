Company name: ChannelMeter

Internal ID: Emp1-dev

Location: USA , CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: Negotiable (USD)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent 

Hours: Full time

Description:
Are you a young, hungry Perl web dev?  Want to be employee #1 at a funded
startup doing YouTube analytics?  We'll give you a moderate salary, great
equity, and a whole lot of responsibility. We'll expect brilliance,
motivation, blood, sweat, and tears. 

You're expected to work onsite most of the time, although telecommuting
will happen. 

Why take this job?  We've been around five months, we're deploying v2 this
month, we've done no marketing and we've already got hundreds of customers,
major corps asking to sign up, and videos about us popping up on YouTube. 


Required skills:

Skills: Perl. 

We care more about your character and learning speed than existing skills.
We can teach you Catalyst but not how to be smart or motivated. 

Desired skills:
Catalyst, DBIC, Moose, jQuery, jqPlot,	SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL. 

Statistics knowledge is a big plus.
