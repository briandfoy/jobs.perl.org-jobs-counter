Job title:
Experienced mod_perl/DBI/FastCGI developer for small NZ company

Company name: Rixington Group Holding Company

Location: New Zealand, Auckland (Albany area)

Pay rate: 80k NZD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We’re looking for an experienced and enterprising hacker with a desire to
work on "Web 2.0" projects for the New Zealand (and wider) market. (Yes, we
know that "Web 2.0" means different things to different people.)

We’re about to launch a nationwide beta of our first NZ-targeted product,
and we have several other projects in mind. That is where you come in.

This is the classic start-up experience, involving dedicated people who
live, think and dream technology. It will involve solving interesting
problems in new ways, doing a lot of work, and hopefully having a lot of
fun, while bringing new products to market in a very fast-paced
environment.

We're also flexible with compensation (equity vs. salary slider), and we'll
tailor a package to meet your experience and expectations.


Who Will I Be Working With?
--------------------------------------------------

You'll be the fourth member of our team, which currently numbers three: one
developer, one designer, and the guy who pays the bills.

As well as this senior position, we’re adding a more junior developer in
the next month or so as well.

We’re a seasoned team and are very serious about the business – the first
two people are imports from the USA, who’ve put in time at some of the
oldest and best known companies on the www. The guy who pays the bills has
successfully founded, built and subsequently sold web
companies in New Zealand going into the last millennium.

We've got a top team here, and are looking for top talent to expand it. If
you are the go-to guy (or gal) in your organisation who enjoys making
decisions as well as executing on them, isn't afraid to speak your mind,
and likes playing with new technologies, you'll fit right in.


What Technologies?
--------------------------------------------------

Our current environment is typical LAMP, consisting primarily of perl 5
programs running via FastCGI and SpeedyCGI on Apache 2.0.x. We use MySQL to
manage our data store. All of this runs on top of CentOS, which is
essentially RedHat Linux.

We are open to other options and technology, if they solve more problems
than they cause.


Am I The One?
--------------------------------------------------

Only time and scrutiny will tell. Our ideal candidate will have some of
these attributes:

- Speaks, reads and writes English fluently. A second language would be
advantageous, but isn't a requirement.

- Has 5-10 years of experience developing and/or operating commercial web
applications based on Linux, MySQL and Apache. Experience with well-known,
high-traffic, 24x7 sites is a huge plus.

- Has 5 or more years experience with Perl 5, especially in a CGI.pm,
mod_perl, or HTML::Mason environment. Don't worry about Fast/SpeedyCGI --
you'll pick that up quickly. Some expertise with the perl DBI interface is
a big plus (but we'd be surprised if you had 5 years of perl without it).

- Has some skill with HTML, Javascript, AJAX and/or PHP.

- Has at least a passing interest in Ruby, Rails and/or Python.

- Reads techcrunch, mashable, slashdot and similar websites on a regular
basis to keep on top of news and information. Bonus points if you're tuned
into OnStartups, Ventureblog, Paul Graham's essays, and other content aimed
at startups and the people who love them.

- Can pick up and start using new technology quickly.

- Isn't afraid to work outside of their job description.

You must be eligible to work in NZ to apply for this role.
