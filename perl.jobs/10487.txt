Job title: Web application developer

Company name: CoolerEmail, Inc

Location: United States, CA, Solana Beach

Pay rate: $40/hr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
CoolerEmail is a growing email marketing and small business service
provider looking for a motivated developer with LAMP experience. This is a
contract position with bonuses depending on the growth of the company and
the contributions made to that growth. Rates will increase with time and
proven ability to complete tasks.

First and foremost, we are looking for someone with the organization and
initiative to manage their own projects. You must be able to work in a
distributed environment (we have no offices), and be comfortable with
telecommuting via phone/email/IM.

At least 5 years of Perl experience is required. You must be familiar with
both procedural and object-oriented development, and have a working
knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Experience with jQuery is a plus.
Experience with XML and API Development is a big plus.

We are an email marketing service provider, so familiarity with email
architecture and MTAs (particularly Port25's PowerMTA) are a big plus.

Experience with MySQL is required, although you don't have to be a DBA.
Experience with Apache is important, but you don't have to be a sys admin.

Occasionally you may have to work directly with customers, so a proven
track record of having done this is key.

You will be part of a unique company that is daily empowering small
businesses to grow. We are a small but very effective group - you will be
on a team of 6 developers and helping bring our new platform to the next
level.

Last but not least, you must love what you do. We are in this because we
believe in what we are doing - and that a small, focused group of
developers can take on the big boys and win. If this sounds like you, we
want to hear from you.

Required skills:
Familiarity with Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl
XML
HTML
CSS
Javascript
jQuery
Email
Good communicator
Comfortable working in a team environment
Organized

Desired skills:
Web API development
Experience with MTA's (ideally, PowerMTA)
Can commit to at least 20 hours/week (we have enough work to give you 5x
that, but realize you're human)
