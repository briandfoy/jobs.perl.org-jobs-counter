Job title: Director Of Engineering

Company name: Elite Digital

Location: Los Angeles, CA

Pay rate: $125k USD + Bonus Up To $75k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Elite Digital is a small company of 25 employees specializing in the sale
of media through online channels. We work behind the scenes to sell
millions of different products around the world. If you've ever bought a
rare book or cd through Amazon, you probably bought it from us. 

We've
been in the industry for more than 10 years, so we are an established
company but we still have that scrappy startup spirit. We currently have a
single developer handling our entire system, which consists of 150k lines
of Perl running on 30 machines.

As the Director Of Engineering you'll
directly shape the future of the business. You'll be responsible for
choosing the technologies, selecting vendors, and growing the team. You'll
be the day-to-day leader, negotiate deliverables, set schedules, and
communicate progress. 

You will wear many hats in this position: project
manager, system administrator, architect, devops, software developer,
mentor, manager, and more. You'll have the opportunity to tackle some
challenging analytical and architectural problems at scale. Your work will
have a visible impact on the bottom line, every day. 

This is a 100%
telecommute position, but candidates must be located in the United States,
ideally in the Los Angeles area. We especially like people who can show us
their work on GitHub, StackOverflow, or CPAN.

Desired skills:
- Are you a self-starter? Are you driven? Are you an ‘A’ Player? 
- Are you
an excellent critical thinker and problem solver? 
- Are you up for the
challenge of increasing sales by implementing new technologies and
enhancing current technologies? 
- Are you able to come into an
organization and quickly understand a complex code base? 
- Are you able to
analyze the costs/time of building upon legacy code vs re-writing it from
scratch? 
- Do you typically create tests before implementing new code? 
-
Are you willing to ensure maximum system uptime by occasionally responding
to urgent system alerts? 
- Do you have a prior track record of success in
your prior positions? 
- Have you successfully worked in a telecommute
position? 
- Do you have 6+ years OO Perl expeience? Are you fluent with
CPAN? 
- Can you design, administer, and optimize MySQL databases? 
- Can
you administer Linux via command line (RHEL or equivalent)? 
- Do you have
two professional job references you can introduce us to? 
- Do you like to
solve complex problems every day? 
- Do you like to learn about new
technologies? 
- Do you play well with others. 

If you said “YES” to all
these questions then you are the person we are searching for!
