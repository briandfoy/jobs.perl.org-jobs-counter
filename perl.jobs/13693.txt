Job title: Entry-level UNIX/perl support

Company name: Restore Health

Location: Madison, WI

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
We need someone to support our perl-based pharmacy system.  Some of the
position will be generalized IT support (e.g. fixing printing problems,
setting up new users, etc) and some will be reading code, finding problems,
checking mysql entries, and coding more and more as comfort level
increases.

The user systems are Windows-based.  The servers are FreeBSD.  FreeBSD
works differently than linux and some familiarity with *BSD is strongly
preferred.
