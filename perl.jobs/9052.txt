Job title: Scripting Genius

Company name: White Oak Technology, Inc.

Location: United States, MD, Silver Spring

Pay rate: Competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're White Oak Technologies, Inc. (WOTI) and we have a number of openings
in the Washington, DC metro area. Don't live here? Not a problem -
relocation packages available for qualified candidates. 

Who you work with: 
You will work with colleagues who will impress you and help you. You will
work in a fast-paced production environment with customers who will
challenge you. You will get to focus on solving hard problems and gain an
understanding of the overall mission and where your part fits in to our
customer’s puzzle. 

Why you want to work with us: 
Our customers come to us to solve their most complex large-scale database
and data engineering problems. Unless you get bored learning new skills,
you will have plenty to keep you challenged. We follow solid SDLC practices
and have high visibility. We offer compensation and comprehensive benefits
that are commensurate with the exceptional quality of candidates sought.
This location and many of our other projects are Metro accessible. We're
proud to be EOE. 

If you're ready for a real challenge, we're waiting to hear from you.

Required skills:
You: 
You’re an awesome programmer & technologist. You’ve made something scale.
You’ve clustered something. You have a favorite data structure. You’re a
proponent of OOD. You have a Top Secret clearance (or have the ability to
obtain and maintain one). You are just as happy slinging code as you would
be designing database schemas, talking to clients, troubleshooting
production problems, or unit testing. 

Applicants must be U.S. citizens and selected applicants will be subject to
a government security investigation and must meet eligibility requirements
for access to classified information. WOTI will assist qualified candidates
by sponsoring their application for a security clearance. 

Desired skills:
Technologies you'll work with: 
Perl, Python, Java, or other open source language 
Web-client, database application development 
OOAD  
RDBMS (Oracle 10g preferred) 
Clustered Linux/UNIX
