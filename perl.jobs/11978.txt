Description:
Plain Black (plainblack.com) is hiring and we’re looking for a geek like
you. Not your average geek, but someone who wears GEEK as a badge. Someone
who breathes Perl, and drinks Linux. A geek who knows that there’s more you
can do with SSH than just open a terminal to a remote box. Someone who
believes that Internet access is not just a human right, but that it’s as
important as air, water, and shelter. If we’ve described you, then please
apply.

Compensation:
 - Gainful employment with a salary of around $50,000 per year.
 - 100% fully paid medical and dental coverage.
 - Profit sharing.
 - A brand new high-end MacBook Pro.
 - Ultra flexible paid time off, up to four weeks per year to start.
 - An expense account.
 - On the job training.
 - An ultra-flexible work schedule.
 - The freedom to telecommute from anywhere.
 - Automatic annual cost of living increases.

Required skills:
You must be able to:
 - Work independently or as a member of a team.
 - Be self-motivated.
 - Write modern Perl, not chicken scratch Perl, and be able to explain the
difference.
 - Use and abuse relational databases like MySQL.
 - Be comfortable with common tools like Bash, Git, Nginx, Apache, and Vim.

 - Know common web development technologies like Javascript, CSS, HTML.
 - Prove U.S. Citizenship, as we do a lot of work for the Federal
Government.

Desired skills:
It would be nice if you:
 - Have experience with Perl web development including one or more of:
WebGUI, Plack, Catalyst, Dancer, or Mojolicious.
 - Have experience with one or more modern Javascript frameworks like
jQuery, YUI, or Dojo.
 - Live in Madison, or at least Wisconsin, or be willing to relocate.
Relocation expenses are available.
