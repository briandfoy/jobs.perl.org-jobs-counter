Description:
The AutoInstalls Group is part of our Core Platforms Group which is
responsible for ESX and our Core Virtualization Infrastructure.

Virtualization is the technology that is poised to change the way we think
about computing. VMware (NYSE: VMW) is the global leader in virtualization
solutions from the desktop to the datacenter. Customers of all sizes rely
on VMware to reduce capital and operating expenses, ensure business
continuity, strengthen security and go green. With 2008 revenues of $1.9

award-winning technology, market-leading position and culture of excellence
provide the more than 6,600 passionate people we employ in 40 locations
worldwide with a platform for professional growth and the excitement of
being an early-stage innovator.

The Virtual Machine Group (VMG) is at the core of VMware R&D.  VMG is
responsible for the creation and functional verification of anything
related to a virtual machine (VM) most importantly the ability to run any
x86 operating system (OS)  and supporting the virtual devices (VD’s) needed
by the VM.  The operating systems include all current and legacy x86 OS’s
whether officially supported or not.  This includes MS Windows, Linux,
Solaris and BSD in all their variations along with many other OS’s.

The AutoInstall Team within the VMG is the most significant development
team contributing to the functional verification of the VM by automatically
(Auto) installing (Install) all variations of these OS’s using their
complex and constantly evolving system software infrastructure written in
C, Perl and Java leveraging proprietary and non-proprietary API’s across
all VMware products.  The AutoInstall team is a highly motivated group of
system software engineers dedicated to supporting the development of the
AutoInstall infrastructure and the R&D staff that depends on it.  The ideal
team member is the engineer who drives to complete in an environment which
requires continuous contribution in the areas of system software
development, evolution of x86 operating system, x86 virtualization, VMware
product internals and the support of one of Silicon Valley’s most
aggressive development environments.
