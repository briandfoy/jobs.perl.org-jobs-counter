Linux skills and be able to magically transform into a sys admin when
necessary. Must be able to work and learn new skills independently when
necessary, but also work in a team environment to develop project
requirements and specifications. Our software is developed in house, so
projects will run a wide gamut of business areas (accounting to warehouse
management, and everything in between). Development would be on an existing
suite of software, so an ability to adapt to and extend an existing
architecture is a must. Responsibilities will include:
web/console/batch/GUI based application development, maintaining and
configuring development servers, participation in requirements and
specifications gathering processes, software quality assurance and
assisting with internal documentation maintenance.

ThinkGeek is a small, close-knit group of fun, weird, and enthusiastic
people who run one of the most successful niche e-commerce sites on the
Internets. As part of SourceForge, Inc, a publicly held company, ThinkGeek
employees receive an excellent benefits package while enjoying the benefits
of working in an exciting start-up environment in our Fairfax, Virginia
office. This posting is for a permanent, full time position in our Fairfax,
Virginia office. Only local applicants or those willing to relocate at
their own expense will be considered.

    * 5+ years professional programming experience with Perl (incl. 5)
    * 4+ years professional experience working with databases (SQL)
    * Extensive knowledge of Apache and familiarity with Apache module
development
    * Solid Linux Knowledge (4+ years of experience with Linux or Unix
systems)
    * Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in
an exacting manner
    * Team oriented personality
