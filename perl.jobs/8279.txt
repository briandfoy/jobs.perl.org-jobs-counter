Job title: Sr. Software Engineer

Company name: Spry.com

Internal ID: dev

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: BOE (60-90k)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Spry is a web hosting provider. The position is primarily developing and
coding the backend systems that provide our clients with interfaces and
control panels for managing their VPS and hosting accounts with us. 

We have a 1.0 provisioning system written in perl that needs to be
rewritten with a number of new features. There are existing control panels
written in PHP and they all need to be replaced by one unified control
panel and account management interface. Integration with PHP applications
will be required as the billing system is a PHP app.

The candidate we're looking for is going to impress us with not just how
well the code works, but also with how easy it is for the rest of us to
grok and tweak it without breaking stuff. 

Required skills:
Perl, PHP, AJAX, SOAP, REST, HTML, CSS.  Must be familiar with functional
and OOP styles and comfortable with both. Must be so familiar with at least
one test framework that you can whiteboard out several tests for a hunk of
code and barely have to think about it.

Desired skills:
Experience with modernbill, WHMCS, and various web hosting control panels
such as Plesk, cPanel, webmin, etc. Experience with Xen and Virtuosso are a
plus.
