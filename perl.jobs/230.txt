Description:
The Quantitative Finance group at the Bank of America is seeking a
full-time Perl programmer. Our group manages a multi-billion dollar
portfolio. We use Perl to set up a large parallel simulation, taking 16
hours on 70 Sun Netras, and to generate reports of the results. These
reports are read daily by bank executives, and are used to make trading
decisions.

The person we hire must be very responsible, as the simulation must run
successfully every night. (Currently, three programmers monitor the
simulation, and the new hire would be added to this group. One person is
never solely responsible for the success of the simulation.) The person
must be able to work accurately under time pressure.

Pay depends on experience and the impact of the employee to the group.
Moving expenses will be paid. There is a starting bonus, an annual bonus,
and at least 4 weeks of vacation per year.


Required skills:
Perl


Desired skills:
C++
Excel macro programming
knowledge of finance or economics
