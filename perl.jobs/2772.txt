Description:
We're looking for a Perl Web Developer- We're currently building a team of
perl web developers, and we're looking for people with Perl as their
primary programming language.

who appreciate such things will enjoy working here.

Required skills:
Strong Perl skills- must be a competent programmer.
Strong Database skills- Preferrably PostgreSQL, but MySQL is also welcome.
Strong Web Development skills- good command of HTML 4.01 strict, XHTML,
java, CSS, and the CGI perl module.
Strong Linux skills- we use Debian as our server platform of choice, but
development environments are up to you.


Desired skills:
Subversion- Code management is done in subversion, so familiarity with it
is a plus.

XML- when apropriate, it's used. knowledge of XML::Simple is a plus.

Java, Asp, Php- We're in the process of replacing legacy systems in these
languages, so familiarity is a plus.

Flash- We don't really expect anyone to have flash experience for this
position, but hey, it would be nice.

Web Design- We have several graphic designers for print media, but any web
design abilities would be welcome.
