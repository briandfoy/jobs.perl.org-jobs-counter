Job title: Senior Perl/Linux/Oracle/Web Developer

Company name: Rent.com, an eBay company

Internal ID: 6303BR

Location: United States, CA, Santa Monica

Pay rate: OPEN

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Rent.com is building new products and has room for another top-level
development engineer.

The recent purchase of Rent.com by eBay means that we get the perks of
being employees of a large company (eBay), and as a Rent.com employees we
also get the direct involvement, responsibilities, and excitement of
working for a small company that is redefining its own industry.

The engineering team at Rent.com is still small, has had  zero turnover in
the last four years (since current management came in), and is composed of
highly qualified developers who know their stuff.

We have built an environment of casual competence, relaxed challenges, and
low-pressure high-productivity.  We can build high quality products quickly
enough that our customers and execs don't feel the need to force artificial
deadlines on us.

We'd love to work with another professional geek who has deep experience
with advanced Perl in production systems, knows how to interact with
serious databases using SQL, is at home on Linux, and enjoys building
clean, simple solutions to demanding problems--software that both work well
and needs minimal maintenance.

Perks for this position currently include: stock options, eBay quarterly
bonus program, ESPP (discounted stock purchase plan), 401(k) with matching,
paid time off, medical coverage, dental, vision, pet insurance, flexible
work hours, company parties, team movie days, reimbursement for home ISP
costs, and knowing that the software you build is used by a million people
each week.


Required skills:
You must be an expert at Perl and Linux and love both. You must be
proficient with SQL (Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL), web
technologies including HTTP/HTML/XML, and object oriented design and
development. You must be able to speak your mind and communicate well with
other tech types.  You must be comfortable with fast-paced development in a
low drama setting.


Desired skills:
Apache, mod_perl, Mason, Template Toolkit, JavaScript,
CSS, sense of humor.  Experience with "lower level" languages like Java,
C/C++ are good indicators of a serious engineer, especially if you now
prefer Perl.
