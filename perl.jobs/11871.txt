Job title: Senior Perl Programmer - Telecommute $140k

Company name: CBN LLC

Location: Las Vegas, Nevada, United States

Pay rate: $100,000-$140,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We need a confident and experienced perl programmer to help us expand our
operations throughout the world.

Our team is quite small, so you would be expected to fill several roles in
addition to perl programming. You would perform some linux system
administration and database administration in addition to the typical
administrative work associated with managing your own part of a software
project. We're spread out around the country, so we communicate through
email, phone, and text messages.

The ideal candidate will have extensive perl programming experience, not
only on web-based systems but also on stand-alone applications. Much of the
code runs outside of a webserver. You will have worked alone or as a senior
member of a significant programming project so that you're comfortable
working from a specification, estimating the time required for a task,
reporting on progress periodically, and delivering tested, usable code.

You will also be responsible for the operation of the code, so ability to
occasionally respond to urgent matters off-hours may be needed. 

Must be U.S. Citizen and currently reside in the U.S.

Required skills:
* use of "Modern Perl" tools like DBIx::Class and Moose
* writing test code for perl
* history of working with XML or JSON APIs

Desired skills:
* writing gearman bots
* linux system administration
* API knowledge
* WWW::Mechanize
* PostgreSQL administration
* git
