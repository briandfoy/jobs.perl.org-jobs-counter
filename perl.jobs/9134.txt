Job title: Senior Perl Engineer (onsite, 3months)

Company name: Lokku Ltd.

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
For more detail see
http://www.lokku.com/jobs/project-q2-2009.txt

In general terms, we need a solution to a large and complex optimization
problem that involves the optimized gradual evolution of a large graph
in response to a dynamic set of objective criteria.  Our plans for this
system will require a solution that can be scaled up easily as we apply
it to larger and larger problem sets and narrow the runtime requirement
from days down to hours.

A complete set of product requirements have been generated by a
non-technical product manager.	You will be responsible for generating
the software and system design and implementing that design.  You will
have the assistance of other Lokku technical staff, but you will be
doing the bulk of the design and coding.  Depending on the design, this
project may involve formal mathematical methods and "cloud" or grid
technologies like Amazon EC2 or similar.


Required skills:
You have at least 5 years of experience writing software in Perl
for UNIX-like operating systems.
You have experience designing large object-oriented software
libraries .
You've worked with distributed systems and large-scale data sets.
You unit-test even unit-tests. And write a test case to make sure
it actually ran.

Desired skills:
Background in formal mathematics or optimization is a big plus.

Knowledge of dataware-house systems, Amazon EC2 and distributed
computing a plus.
