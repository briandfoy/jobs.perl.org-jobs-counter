Job title: Backend developer

Company name: FastMail

Location: Melbourne, Australia

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We strive to build clean, well-tested, reusable code -- to have our backend
code look as good, and work as well, as our interface. With a swiftly
growing customer (and code) base, we are looking to add new team mates to
help make sure we are reaching our own standards.

Together with our other
engineers, you'll work on FastMail and its associated systems. You'll
quickly take ownership of features, and see your code ship to production.

We are a close-knit team, but do most projects individually. We are always
ready to jump in with an extra set of eyes, a lengthy explanation of why
things work the current way or just to grab a coffee, but you should feel
comfortable making desisions solo.

Our backend infrastructure is widely
varied, in both subject matter and style -- expect plenty of refactoring
and converting in-place code to reusable methods. We are also looking ahead
to adding more integrations with other services, our own new products, and
improving existing features!

Desired skills:
You may be a fit for this role if you:

* Have strong Perl skills. This is
the main language that implements almost all of our FastMail-specific
server-side logic. It's possible that you'll use other languages, but
you'll need to be (or quickly become) up to speed in modern Perl.

* Score
"lines of code deleted" as high or higher than "lines written". Hearing
"refactor" sparks joy in your heart. The first time you saw NYTProf, you
thought of three pieces of code you were dying to run it on.

* Enjoy
developing, then working to, a specification document. Our user interface
uses a well-defined API to communicate with our servers, and you will need
need to be able to program to the specified API. We believe implementing to
a spec ends up with high-quality, maintainable code, and hope you do, too.

* Feel comfortable asking questions: we encourage dialogue with other team
members over ambiguous, dubious, or otherwise suspect specifications,
quirky code that doesn't make sense, or just the whys behind a task!

* Are
comfortable picking up new tools, evaluating existing solutions, or just
building your own. We think long term, and want to ensure we control our
future. We like to fully understand the code we run, whether it's something
we wrote ourselves or an open-source component we contribute to.
