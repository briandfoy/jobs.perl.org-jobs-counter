Job title:
Perl Developers for Funded, Growing Startup Company

Company name: iTeam

Internal ID: PerlDev1

Location: United States, MA, Littleton

Pay rate: based on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
iTeam has developed an automated software platform for selling and
delivering IT services in high volume across North America.  Our unique and
patent-pending technologies have attracted some of the largest reseller
channels in North America to use our platform.	Developers will work on all
aspects of the platform including new features and enhancements, code
transitioning, integration with other systems, and more.

We seek Perl developers to build out our next stage of integrating with
partners which will enable us to reach many more people. 

- telecommute, work from home or your own office

- contract position, flexible hours

- Amazon EC2 development server available with all needed libraries
installed

- original programmer available to answer your questions about the existing
code base and how to implement project requirements 

The work is organized as a series of small projects.  Each programmer is
responsible for doing their project from beginning to end: starting with
understanding what iTeam needs, and going all the way through assessing the
current code, implementation, integration, reviewing the implementation
with iTeam to see if any tweaks need to be made, testing, to delivering
working code. 

Required skills:
Perl (including object oriented Perl development)
 MySQL
 HTML, CSS, XML
 web application development (whether in Perl or some other language)
 experience getting two different systems to talk to each other (could be
web services or some other technology) 
 debugging and problem solving
 basic Linux (login using ssh, running programs on the command line)


Desired skills:
This is for you if you:

- are in the mood to crank out some code
- can look at existing code (some of it really terrible legacy code) and
figure out what is going on
- see an existing application and say "ok, there are the five paths the
user can take through this system, so here are all the things that are
going to need to be tested before and after making my change" 
- are good at asking questions about iTeam's needs and how things work (or
currently aren't working) in the existing code base
