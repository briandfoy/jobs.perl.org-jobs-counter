Job title: Shopping Cart/ Customer log-in setup

Company name: Pixicated Design and Print

Location:
United States, CA, Redlands, CA - Las Vegas, NV

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: negotiable

Hours: Flexible

Description:
1.	User Log-in/Shopping Cart:
a.	  Creation of user is very important. Here we will need to collect
information about our client and store it for future contact usage, as well
as for purchasing capabilities (explained in detail below). There will be
to types of clients, Retail and “Pro Shop Partners”(wholesale). This will
be determined at time of user creation.
i.	The only way to log in as a PSP is to have an existing account
number with Tartan. This list will be provided to us.  PSP’s get a
different price on each item and sometimes there is a promotion, i.e.
receiving a “free” item with a certain purchase, “free” item will be
automatically added to shopping cart when the special item is added to
cart.  It will say FREE.
b.	  Once logged in User will be able to see their past purchases,
Pending purchases (when they are to be shipped, cost, payment used,
estimated arrival date), as well as a “wishlist” of item they are thinking
about purchasing (with these all they need to do to purchase them is to add
them to the cart which should be displayed directly near the item).
c.	  User can choose not to have to log-in every time if they
wish…their main computer will be recognized for 120 days without having to
log back in.

2.	Purchasing capabilities:
a.	  While using the catalog progress must be saved immediately once
something is added to wishlist or shopping cart, this way customer can come
back at anytime to where they left off.
b.	  Each item available will have several properties: Retail and
wholesale cost, color, style#, and shipping cost.  Once added to cart, item
will then be adjusted for quantity and size quantity, and bulk shipping.
Item should be referred to as “TN XXX?” (style#).
c.	  Once order has been placed a sales receipt with ORDER # should be
generated on screen and be a printable version.  Also an e-mail should be
sent to purchaser’s e-mail address and to Tartan (Sales office/Shipping
Office/Records) with similar information.  Tartan will then be made aware
of what has been purchased and by whom.
i.	Each order made should be put into an organized list that can be
sorted by date ordered, size of order, priority, and customer.

3.	Customers:
a.	Once Customer has been created using the website they should then
be recognized by both name and a customer # which should be generated at
time of account creation.  This # should be attached to all threads
associated with such customer.
b.	Customer should always be able to logon or call main office to see
order status and past orders. We should also be able to see the same
information.
