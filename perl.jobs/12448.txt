digging through log files, testing of local and distant networks and
various other forms of research as a part of the process, and the ability
to solve these puzzles is important to the job. A love of puzzles is a
definite plus.

company and we are looking for people to become part of our team.

* Minimum of 4 years of schooling in a computer-related field, or the
professional equivalent

* * Some non-empty subset of <em>Java</em>, <em>C++</em>, <em>C</em>
					
* Ability to program in:
* * HTML
* * Perl
* * SQL
* * JavaScript (using AJAX)

* Ability to operate as both a self-starter and team player
* Good people and communication skills
* Eagerness to learn and a love of technology
