Job title:
One-off contractor for simple HTTP 'push' service using epoll() on Linux
2.6

Company name: undisclosed until candidate is selected

Location:
United States, Illinois / New York, Chicago / New York City

Pay rate: To be negotiated based on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: one week

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We have a small application that exists as a proof-of-concept that accepts
long-lived HTTP requests on the front-end and accepts notifications via
another listening HTTP instance on the back-end, returning the notification
to the front-end client.

In short, it is a special-purpose webserver.

It was prototyped in another language and must be reimplemented in Perl for
scalability and performance reasons.  The current implementation is under
350 lines not counting external generic libraries.  

In our first Perl version, we'd like to be able to support at least 10,000
connections per 1GB of ram, which shouldn't be difficult, and five to ten
times that in subsequent optimized versions.  As almost every connection is
idle almost the entire lifespan of the socket, this should be easily
attainable.

We are located in Chicago and New York but your location is irrelevant
provided you are accessible by email and telephone.  You can work at your
location or either of ours (Chicago or New York) at whatever hours are
convenient for you.

Note that this is a one-off contract project, although excellent
performance will likely lead to ongoing per-project relationships.

Please contact us via email at jpaul@datavibe.net and include your contact
information (telephone number is mandatory) and a small (10kB or less) text
attachment (no archives) of a representative module or script that you have
written in the past.

Required skills: Linux 2.6 epoll, Perl, HTTP

Desired skills:
Danga::Socket may prove to be useful when implementing this service.
