Job title: Perl Kung-Foo Artist

Company name: OmniTI Computer Consulting, Inc.

Location: United States, MD, Columbia

Pay rate: Depends on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
OmniTI is looking for developers to join its diverse and talented team. We
specialize in both fixing and building highly scalable web applications for
clients with high-volume, mission-critical online systems: robust
applications servicing tens of millions of people.

Translation: you get to work with big toys, smart people with serious
skills and a plethora of awesome technologies, all in a casual and open
environment with pizza and donuts galore. We work on some pretty hefty Perl
code bases. How does half a million lines of Perl sound? We eat that for
breakfast. Sprinkle Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL on top at a few thousand
transactions per second, and you have a nice recipe for a web site that
services 20 million consumers. Want to work on projects like this?

Required skills:
* 3-5 years experience programming in Perl (or PHP with a desire for a
better life).
* Familiarity with DHTML/JavaScript Programming.
* Good understanding of Web Standards (HTML, XML, CSS).
* Working knowledge of SQL (Oracle, Postgres or MySQL).
* Experience working in Solaris, Linux, BSD or another UNIX-like
environment.
* Ability to play nicely with others and work independently.
* Intelligence with a sense of humor.


Desired skills:
* Familiarity with mod_perl.
* Working knowledge of Apache Web Server.
* Experience building AJAX Applications.
* Exposure to Version Control Systems (CVS or Subversion).
