Job title:
Freelancer for Tasks on new Bloonix Monitoring WebGUI

Company name: Blunix GmbH

Location: Berlin, Germany, you can work remotely worldwide

Pay rate: Please send us your hourly rate

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for some small extensions on the new Bloonix Monitoring
System, which can be found at https://github.com/bloonix. We would need a
couple of new feelds in https://github.com/bloonix/bloonix-webgui as well
as new Plugins https://github.com/bloonix/bloonix-plugins-basic

For
working with the Tool you might need an introduction to the Bloonix
Monitoring System, which we can provide. However we don't know much about
the codebase itself, so you'd have to work into that. The code sadly isnt
documented to much, and lots of the doc on how to use the tool is in
german. We can help you setup an instance for development in vagrant or
whatever you may prefer.

We would like to have all additions to be
commited as PRs to github, so the additions are to be open source.

Desired skills:
Well you should know about Perl - the Core Components are written in Perl.
You will have to add some minor new functionality to the API and then in
the Webgui. The Webgui seems mostly js. Also we need additional custom
Plugins https://github.com/bloonix/bloonix-plugins-basic/ and would be
happy to find a Programmer that could code monioring Plugins for us every
now and then on a long term basis.
