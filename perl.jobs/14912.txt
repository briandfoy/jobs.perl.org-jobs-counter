Description:
We are looking to recruit an experienced and talented full-stack web
developer to join the Ensembl Genomes team at the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EMBL-EBI) located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus near
Cambridge in the UK.

Ensembl Genomes (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org) provides access to
genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species, utilising the Ensembl
software platform for genome analysis and annotation. The successful
candidate will work as part of a small team of web developers with
responsibilities including:

-  The maintenance of the software infrastructure needed for public service

-  The development of new features for data visualisation and analysis
-  Developing the Ensembl platform in conjunction with the Ensembl and
Ensembl Genomes teams
-  Providing web support for other EMBL-EBI projects mainly based on
Ensembl technology or data  
-  Data production coordination

EMBL-EBI is part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and is
Europe's leading provider of information services to biological researchers
in academia and industry. EMBL-EBI staff enjoy many benefits including
sports facilities, a free shuttle bus to Cambridge and other nearby
centres, and an attractive working environment set in 55 acres of parkland
alongside being close to major transport links to London.  Our salary
scales are very competitive.

Required skills:
Applicants should have a degree in a biological or computer science, and
proven professional programming experience.  Applicants should be
experienced in web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) ideally using
Perl.  Advanced knowledge of any other modern programming languages, e.g.
Python and PHP, would be considered.

Maintaining communication with several collaborating teams is an important
aspect of the role. Good communication and interpersonal skills are
therefore essential. A flexible mindset, a capacity for independent work,
and a commitment to the delivery of a high-quality public service, are all
required.

Desired skills:
Knowledge of the following would be highly desirable: MySQL, Git, Linux,
Apache, mod_perl, software testing, user interface design and Ensembl. 
Working knowledge of biology/biochemistry/genomics is desirable but not
essential.
