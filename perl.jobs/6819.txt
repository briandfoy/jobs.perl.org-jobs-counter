Pay rate: 42,000 - 47,000 USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
The company was founded in January of this year, but is already profitable
and has also captured the attention of several investors.  We sell market
research data mined from ecommerce merchants.  

Four programmers constitute the salaried development staff of the company,
so willingness to work independently and in small teams is a must.

This is an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in working on bots
and data mining, with a Perl approach.	We have in-house Perl libraries for
tracking and mining data from merchants, and the primary function of this
position will be to further develop these libraries.

The salary is negotiable based on experience.

Please send details of your experience in relevance to this project. Only
emails with resumes attached will be responded to.  

A small aptitude test will be administered to potential candidates before
an interview.

Required skills:
Proficiency in Perl regular expressions, proper threading and forking
techniques.  

Desired skills:
Working knowledge of XML, sockets and Linux are also preferred.
