Job title: Perl Developer & Web Kung-Fu Master

Company name: Traveltek Ltd.

Internal ID: SDEV

Location: United Kingdom, Glasgow, East Kilbride

Pay rate: Dependant on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Traveltek is the UK leader in online travel solutions, from consumer facing
websites to  call center applications. We have customers big and small,
from single high street agencies to the largest travel companies in the
world. We handle millions of page views per month, deal with databases that
process tens of millions of rows per hour, and offer a great environment
for the technically inclined to challenge their abilities.

We're looking to add some new people to our already extensive team, and are
on the hunt for programmers who think they have what it takes to master
Perl. Perhaps you're already a Perl expert, or a PHP, Python or Ruby
programmer who is looking for a new challenge. We deal with more code (3
million lines and counting) and more data (hundreds of millions of rows)
then you've likely come across before, but if that sounds like fun, this is
the place for you.

Some knowledge of Linux or other flavour of UNIX would be a plus, as this
is what our whole platform runs on. Some database experience is definitely
a must, MySQL especially. And as you will dealing with customers and we
pride ourselves on good service, good communication skills are key.
Finally, you'll need a willingness to learn. Almost everything we do is
likely to be new to you, and you should be ready for a challenge.

This position is based in our Head Office in East Kilbride and the
successful candidate will benefit from a competitively based salary.

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL

Desired skills:
- Apache
- Linux
- mod_perl
- XML
- Buzzword compliance
