Job title: Developer Tools Engineer

Company name: Yahoo!

Internal ID: 16235

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Internet is a big, busy place, and we at Yahoo! are proud to stand out
in the crowd. As the world's number one Internet brand, servicing over a
half billion people, we're determined to maintain our commitment to
delivering news, entertainment, information and fun... each and every day.

In order to maintain our position as one of the world's most trafficked
Internet destinations, we're always on the lookout for people with big
ideas and big talent to help us provide our visitors with the innovative
products and services they've come to expect from Yahoo!. We're looking for
people like you.

How Big Can You Think?

Welcome to the Developer Tools team at Yahoo! The DevTools team already
provides source code management, deployment, bug tracking, build tools and
documentation systems to thousands of fellow engineers.

As we further integrate our developer infrastructure, we want to provide a
best-in-class reports solution. The reports solution will draw data from
our bug-tracking system (Bugzilla) and from our source code repositories
(Subversion and CVS). The reports solution will better inform engineers and
managers about the state of their products.

This is a rare opportunity to design and implement a best-in-class modern
workflow for optimized software development.

We aim to release much of our technology to the open source community. A
passion for open source, and experience in contributions, is therefore very
welcome.

It goes without saying that we need highly motivated, self-starters with
excellent technical expertise. We're a growing yet cohesive team, so
attitude and experience count for a lot. DevTools is a fun group to be a
part of. We look forward to meeting you!

Personal Note:

Based on a similar posting on perl-jobs in November, 2006, I started my
Yahoo! career in January 2007.	I couldn't be happier.	Yahoo! is a great
place to work, and working in DevTools is greater still.  I can't summarize
why I love working here in just a quick blurb, so check it out for
yourself!  No company is perfect, but you might be surprised at how much
you'll like ours.

Required skills:
- Perl 4 years
- mysql 3 years
- 4 years professional experience
- strong html, js
- strong analytical skills
- strong inter-personal skills and great communication
- passion for solving tough problems.


Desired skills:
- Perl 7+ years
- mysql 5 years
- Perl Template Toolkit - 2 years
- Exposure to Yahoo's open source YUI libraries.
- Experience in designing and implementing web services.
- Bugzilla development experience is a strong advantage.
- Experience in building or using other reports systems is also very
helpful.
