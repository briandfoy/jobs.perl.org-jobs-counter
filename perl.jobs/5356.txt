Job title: Web Store Developer/Designer

Company name: Best Friends Cocoa

Location: United States, MA, Arlington

Pay rate: Bid

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are building a new storefront that will use Amazon.com's store as the
back end. It will likely be all static HTML pages generated via templates
and simple text files. The Perl work will be in the parsing of those files
and rendering with a templater (Template::Simple will be used). TThe HTML
need to be clean and use CSS. There will be about 10 pages on the
storefront. See the contact URL for the current site.

Send examples of web sites you have designed and Perl code. Selected
candidates will be asked to then submit a bid based on a more detailed set
of requirements.

There will be some ongoing work on this site as well as potentially other
projects if there is a good match. This is an opportunity to also have a
mentor (me) guide you through many interesting Perl projects. So this is a
good chance for some talented but lacking in experience Perl hacker to get
real world skills and training.

Required skills:
Solid HTML & CSS
Perl templating (preferably Template::Simple)
Basic parsing in Perl


Desired skills:
Graphic design
Storefront design
Amazon Store API
