Job title: Perl developer

Company name: Adzuna

Location: London, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Perl Developer at Adzuna

We are looking for an experienced Perl developer to support the ongoing
development of the Adzuna job search engine. This is a great opportunity to
join a fast-growing, early-stage startup.

As the sixth member of the team you will work on a Solr powered frontend
website, with a Gearman-powered, distributed backend aggregating job ads
from across the web, crunching job market data and applying machine
learning algorithms to enhance job seekers’ experience.

You will need to thrive on working independently in a fast-moving,
low-structure environment. You will have the chance to help shape our
technical direction and processes as we grow. An appreciation of the
‘devops’ movement is essential as we manage and monitor the systems
ourselves. You will also need to understand the importance of building
structured code that is fast, scalable, reliable and robust. 

The projects you will work on will include new search features, relevancy
and matching algorithms, APIs and ‘big data’ analysis, reporting tools and
features to enhance the job search experience on Adzuna. Our systems have
been built to scale, and you will be able to demonstrate your experience in
writing scalable code running in distributed environments.

Required skills:
Excellent Object-Oriented Perl
Apache, fastcgi
MySQL
Solr or other search engine experience
Linux
Testing
Version control (Git)
Understanding of distributed systems

Desired skills:
Experience with templating frameworks (ideally Template Toolkit)
Moose/Catalyst
Spidering technology
Catalogue / feeds management
Search engine optimisation
Classified ads / vertical search websites
Cloud services integration
Chef
ElasticSearch
Machine learning / neural nets
Gearman or other distributed job-dispatching mechanisms
