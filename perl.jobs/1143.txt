Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Description:
We are seeking a Perl expert with Perl socket function experience to write
scripts, troubleshoot problems, and assist with other tasks.

It will be very helpful for you to know Unix/Linux as well, but you will
not have to be a Unix expert.

Initially, this will be a part time position, so you won't be able to count
on it as your sole income source.  We are a new company, so we are
interested in candidates who desire compensation based on performance
instead of guaranteed hourly salaries.	We will make the performance scale
very profitable for those who are productive.

You can work from your home mostly, but some of the work will be on-site.
Therefore, you should live within 60 miles of the Dallas, Texas area.

Please send a brief description of your experience along with your contact
phone number to jobs@penwide.com
