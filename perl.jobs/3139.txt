PERL Fulltime Senior Programmer for an Online Travel Agency

Company name: WorldBy.Com SPA - www.worldby.com

Internal ID: LAMP

Location: Italy, Tuscany, Empoli - Florence

Pay rate: 40-55k euro gross, depending on skills

Description:
SELECTION PROCESS

The selection process will be represented by a one-off project assignment,
in the pure freelance scheme. We'll regularly pay this one-off project and
we'll evaluate the skills applied by the candidate in the project based on
which we'll decide to hire or not to hire the candidate for a long term
partnership (the form has to be determined: regular employee, freelance
contract, company-to-company contract, or whatever the candidate will
prefer). The one-off project will also be useful to determine the skill
level and therefore the starting wage/compensation of the long term
partnership.

After having developed, delivered and paid the first one-off project, we
preserve the right to not proceed any further in the partnership. If we
decide to proceed as the one-off project gave us satisfactory results, our
offer will be calibrated on the skills shown by the candidate in the
project and it will vary between 40 and 55k euro (gross yearly wage).  As
stated above, the contract type will have to be defined according to the
candidate's preferences. The lenght of the contract will be ideally without
any term (as long as possible).

It is possible to work off-site (from home or your own office) only if in
possession of at least a flat-fee ADSL internet connection that will allow
Skype etc. Working on-site (location will be Empoli, Italy then) will be
appreciated although not required.

Required skills:
-Expertise in Perl (CGI not mod_perl)
-Expertise in MySQL
-Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, XML, DHTML and CSS
-Knloledge of VB.
-Having already developed web applications that we could check online o
offline.
-Excellent grasp in spoken English language (all our team speaks English
only).

Desired skills:
Knowledge of the system administrator's related services (SSH, FTP, HTTP,
SSL, MySQL, BIND, POP e SENDMAIL).
