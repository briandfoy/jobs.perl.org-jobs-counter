Description:
We’re looking for smart, experienced Perl/C/C++ programmers/MMOG

know the land of Perl and/or C like the back of your hand, we need you.
Online games integrate our rich communications feature set using a C-based
SDK provided for Mac, Linux and Windows clients. The interfaces game
developers want to use are vast, varied and growing, so our Quality team
must be poised to build an ever-growing number of test applications in an
array of different environments. To do this, we need to find a few key
innovators to build and add to our test beds, implementing with new
interfaces as they come rolling in. The work is fun, fast and very high
impact.

Environment:
     - Very dynamic development framework (lots of builds, interesting
tactical customer challenges)
     - Small development and ops team (lots of direct interaction and team
discussion on fixes and scheduling)
     - Early stages of building QA process  (little overhead to get
started, lots of room for new ideas)
     - Wide range of technologies, platforms and networks

Main responsibilities:
     - automation lead on a major project
     - technical leadership on Perl/C test code design and implementation
     - prioritizing and designing test scripts
     - reporting, demonstrating and institutionalizing use
     - scripting test scenarios large and small
     - running scripts and reporting results
     - teaching/mentoring other QAers the use of scripts, reading results,
etc.


Required skills:
- heavy Perl experience supporting on multiple platforms
- strong C or C++ programming experience
- Unix/Linux/Mac scripting
- demonstrable understanding of distributed systems,  network protocols
and/or VoIP
- strong familiarity with testing methodologies, particular for
API's/parameterized testing


Desired skills:
- experience using SWIG to bridge between C and java, C#, Python or Perl
- writing multi-client, remote-client and cross-platform
scripts/applications
- using Perl’s Test::More, Deep and Simple
