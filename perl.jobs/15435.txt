to improve the accessibility, interoperability, sustainability and
governance of paleobiological data and cyberinfrastructure resources. 


From improving numerical model predictions of next year’s atmospheric
temperature to explaining geological strata laid down in previous eras,
from monitoring water transport through the atmosphere to modeling water
movement at the bottom of the ocean, scientists and students in AOES are
working to better understand our planet in myriad ways. AOES activities
include research and a doctoral program in Climate Dynamics; research and
undergraduate degrees in Atmospheric Science, Earth Science, and Geology;

some of the basic structure of the Paleobiology Database (PBDB); creation
of an Application Programming Interface (API) that will combine data from
the PBDB and the Neotoma database in a logical and consistent fashion; and
some processing of scientific data for inclusion in the PBDB. 


The PBDB
programming will be in Perl. Additional HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and R
programming will also be required. Additional duties will include updating
existing Web sites, and creation of new ones based on current Web site
design modalities with provided content and specified functionality.

Desired skills:
