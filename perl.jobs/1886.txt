Job title: Web Services Developer

Company name: Digital Craftsmen Ltd

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: 2-300GBP/day

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
We need a Perl developer experienced in building client server applications
that communicate using SOAP to join our team to work on a specific project
for a key client.

The project involves the development of an extranet authentication and
authorisation system using mod_perl and providing hooks for Template
Toolkit based applications.

The user management side of the application will reside on the client's
site, inside their firewall, and communicate with the externally hosted
extranet server using SOAP.

The management application will be responsible for handling events
generated on the server-side, such as password reset requests and
user-account lockouts.

For bonus points, it should be integrated into the bricolage UI, which the
client will be using for managing the content of this site.

If you can complete that lot in short order, we have other parts of the
project to fill your time, including developing an SVG charting
application.

Daily rates are dependent on experience and skills.

Teleworking is possible but it's not something we're terribly used to so
you'll need to convince me that you can turn our functional requirements
into a good specification and working code at a distance.

If you're interested in a permanent position rather than a contract, please
get in touch as this may be a possibility for the right person.

Digital Craftsmen specialises in content management, information
architecture, web based applications and managed hosting.

Required skills:
Apart from an excellent grasp of object oriented perl, you will be
comfortable working with the following technologies.

Postgres
Apache
mod_perl
XML/SOAP
HTML::Mason
Template Toolkit
Class::DBI

You will have worked on the development or maintenance of complex perl
based applications and have demonstrable experience of working in this
environment including a strong appreciation for, and liking of, version
control, testing and, yes, documentation.

We use bricolage (www.bricolage.cc) as the content management system for
this project and any experience of it will be beneficial but not essential.
You will, however, have proven experience or developing large scale
applications using HTML::Mason and Postgres.

You must be a team player and able to communicate your ideas verbally and
in writing, doubly so if you would like to work remotely.

Contact information:
Please send CVs in pdf, html or plain text along with availability and
salary expectations to Simon Wilcox - simon@digitalcraftsmen.net

Closing date - Friday 10th September.
