Job title:
Sr Software Engineer, Software Engineer, Web Engineer

Company name: Topix

Internal ID: perl.org

Location: United States, Ca, Palo Alto

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Topix is not a typical company, and we don't intend to become one. Most
startups don’t make it through the first few years and in that time will
burn through lots of cash and burn-out their employees in the process. We
strive to maintain the agility and innovation of a startup, with the
thoughtfulness and care of our employees and business that a more mature
organization can provide. Our business is growing and traffic has more than
doubled in the past year. We’re already a top 20 news site (comscore and
netratings) and we partner with CNN, AOL, Associated Press, Earthlink and
the top 3 newspaper companies in the US. 

We’re looking for talented engineers (without the bad attitude and bloated
ego that can go with it) to help us grow even more. Join us, and in return,
you’ll grow with us and have the opportunity to make big contributions. You
may or may not know exactly where you want to go with your career in the
long term, but you probably know what you don’t want – to be known by your
employee number, work on shelfware, get stuck on projects where you have no
say in the outcome and no chance for creativity. At Topix, we understand
those concerns have created an environment that encourages you to be
creative and solve problems, while working on things that matter to us and
our audience. You are encouraged to: come into work during the business
hours that make sense for your biorhythm, suggest and implement new
features, have a life outside of work and work on things that are mutually
beneficial. And, since we’re a friendly bunch, you won’t be met with scorn
and ridicule in the process. 

So, if you have the desire to work on web scale software, be creative in
the design of new features, share ideas and make a difference, come talk
with us.

Required skills:
Perl knowledge :-)
Ability to work independently in a small team
Knowledge of how to write code that performs, scales and is maintainable
A good feeling for what the end user and would want
Great communication skills
Willing and able to own a feature from brainstorm to final code push  

Desired skills:
Knowledge of template toolkit, Javascript, AJAX, other web technologies
