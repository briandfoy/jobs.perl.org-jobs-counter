Job title: Sr. Software Engineer, Lead Mechanic

Company name: Shiftboard, Inc.

Location: Seattle, WA, USA

Pay rate: Competitive - DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Shiftboard is a small, lean-oriented, open-source friendly
Software-as-a-Service company in Seattle.  We work in sun-drenched offices
overlooking Puget Sound, right downtown, and we solve real problems
everyday. If you don't like the sun, we have shades.  If you like working
in the dark, you can keep the lights off.

We provide online scheduling tools, community and workforce management and
optimization services to a diverse range of organizations around the world:
By diverse, we mean both businesses and non-profits - events and festivals,
municipal/government, healthcare institutions, staffing agencies,
universities, and contact centers

We are profitable and we are growing quickly -- Not a fly-by-night
financial scheme. We need your help. We have a tremendous referral base
coming from hundreds of dedicated customers; many of them are familiar
brand names and/or highly influential, cultural, musical, educational,
arts, and sporting institutions. 

To be sure, some of our customers operations may not be so exciting, but
our data and our scaling requirements to service them all can nonetheless,
be incredibly fascinating when approached with a proper set of lenses.

What will you do here? You'll be building products for people as diverse as
major hospitals, the SXSW organization, MLB, Harvard University, MIT,
Groupon, LivingSocial, the Red Cross, even Burningman, Bonnaroo, and the
Sundance Institute. Hundreds of groups that could be described as major
events, staffing groups, contact centers, universities, and municipal
governments worldwide, use our products and we're working everyday to make
them even happier -- we need your help.

Right now, the next Senior Software Development Engineer joining our team
will be responsible for the development of a wide range of products, both
new and evolving. With the right kind of results and motivation, where you
take this position on our team is almost limitless.

You'll have your choice of tools (mostly) and you'll grow your skillset by
developing for web, data center, mobile applications, and public/private
API's. You'll need to think a lot about scaling our mostly web, mobile, and
telephony-based services. You'll also be thinking about automating our
infrastructure and leveraging virtualization, caching, and related
technologies to get more things done. Basically, you'll join a
tightly-focused team working to build a highly engaging product to service
the needs of millions of people around the world.

We're small and you're able to have an immediate impact, you'll be at the
junction of mobile and location-based services that really matter for
people's lives, and you'll have the autonomy to get the right things done.

If you are looking to grow your career, there are multiple pathways here to
expand the role and responsibility level of the right candidate.

Required skills:
-  Play well with others, communicate clearly, demonstate a high-level of
personal and professional integrity
  -  Strong Linux/Unix Skills. DevOps experience, mindset or interest
  -  5+ years commercial software development experience on open-source web
architectures; real software shipping to end users, with a range of
experiences you can share
  -  Solid experience with perl and/or python, with C++, Java, or a blend
of functional languages within a production environment.
  -  Experience building and consuming web services (JSON/RPC, REST, etc.)
and strong opinions about their design
  -  Experience or understanding of the front-end web stack (Javascript,
CSS/HTML) - everyone does full-stack development here
  -  Maybe a Bachelor's (or Master's) in Computer Science. Equivalent. 
Real world experience might be better.

Desired skills:
-  Leading, helping, and/or mentoring others
  -  Experience with one or more caching, scaling, and/or other noSQL
architectures (memcached, redis, RabbitMQ, couchDB, etc.), mobile client
platforms (iOS/Android), telephone/IVR systems (Asterix, etc.), and/or
automated testing tools (Selenium, WatiR, etc.)
  -  Virtualization technologies.
  -  Success or Failure with one or more home-grown, commercial, or
community-based web development frameworks
