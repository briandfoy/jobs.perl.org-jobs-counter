Job title:
Perl Hacker for Community/Social Photo Sharing Site

Company name: PictureTrail

Location: United States, CA, Santa Clara

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We're located in the San Francisco bay area. If you're local to the SF bay
area, this would be mostly a virtual commute with occasional face to face
meetings.  If you're not local to us, this is a virtual commute full time
job opportunity with occasional fly outs to have face to face meetings.

Because of the challenge of cross-timezone collaboration, preference is
given to candidates in PST or candidates able to work standard PST business
hours.

We are a popular and profitable photo sharing/social networking site run by
small group in San Francisco, seeking a talented junior to mid-level perl
hacker (who knows some PHP).

Our systems are a mix between Perl and PHP, with active work to migrate
towards the Catalyst MVC framework.  This effort requires candidates eager
to make use of test harnesses, and experience with code refactoring as well
as ongoing development tasks on both the front-end and back-end site.

We’ve been online since 1999 and are quite stable but very much a startup
atmosphere. We’re now currently growing very quickly and are looking for
someone who will thrive in a very fast paced environment.  


Required skills:
* Bachelor's Degree in computer science.
* 2+ years software development experience on Unix platforms (We use
FreeBSD).
* Developing community based web applications
* Scalable and robust systems (understanding high-availability and system
design issues of high traffic sites). 
* Fault tolerant software.
* Perl, PHP, RDBMS, Apache+FastCGI, MySQL 


Desired skills:
We're looking for a team member who can also do the following:

* Contribute to design and development decisions
* Implement new and evolutionary website features
* Refactor existing code to operate inside the Catalyst framework
* Build test scripts (Both unit and live regression tests)
* Assist in improving and evolving back-end integration. 
* Must be able to help with the design, coding and testing as well as work
jointly with other team members to deliver quality applications.
* Collaborate with CPAN authors as necessary
* Familiarity with JavaScript, XML, AJAX, FreeBSD, Subversion (SVK a big
plus)

Preferably, the right candidate will also have:
* Strong verbal and written skills
* Some background in wireless programming will be helpful. 
* Some experience in scheduled/automated testing will be helpful.
