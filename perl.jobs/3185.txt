Job title:
SF-based Startup Seeks Talented Software Engineers (web app on LAMP/Perl)

Company name: DD

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
- Have you been looking for the "right" next challenge?

- Have you considered working at Google, but wanted to make a bigger impact
within a smaller organization?	

- Are you interested in working closely with veteran founders who have been
backed previously by Kleiner and Sequoia among others?

We are a stealth-mode startup based in San Francisco that has a
game-changing approach to a big consumer market.  Our prototype is already
in closed beta among thousands of users in select cities across the
country.

We are seeking high-caliber Software Engineers to drive continuing
development of our scalable, consumer web application based on the LAMP
(Linux/Apache/Mysql/Perl) platform.

You will:
* Play a key role as a member of the company's initial core engineering
team of 4-5 engineers
* Design and develop components for our scalable web application according
to business requirements
* Tackle interesting implementation, performance, and scalability
challenges
* Take additional responsibility over one or more key engineering areas:
eg. tools, platform, release engineering, etc.
* Help establish an engineering culture that prides itself on best
practices, efficiency, and quality delivery

You will need to take the initiative, get hands-on, learn fast, and work
hard.


Required skills:
The ideal candidate will have the following qualifications:
* Perl, HTML, SQL, object-oriented programming (eg. C++, Java, OO Perl 5,
Python, etc.) - experience required
* LAMP web application stack, MVC frameworks (eg. Catalyst, Ruby on Rails,
J2EE/Struts, .NET, etc.) - experience a big plus
* Working knowledge of Linux and shell scripting
* UML, Rational, or Extreme Programming a plus
* 1-4 years professional software engineering experience preferred, but
recent graduates from top-tier schools encouraged to apply
* Technical BA/BS from a top-tier school preferred
