Job title:
Two things that make developers happy - mid/senior developers in London

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: London

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Not everyone=E2=80=99s like me. Perhaps nobody=E2=80=99s like me. But when =
it comes to
enjoying programming jobs, and particularly when it comes to enjoying Perl
programming jobs, there are two things that are needed to make me happy
that I suspect resonate with most other career developers.

The first of
those is working with a codebase that doesn=E2=80=99t fight me back. Nietzs=
che
famously wrote:

"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he
himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the
abyss also gazes into you."

Earlier in my career I had a real sense of
machismo about working with poor quality codebases. The amount of
low-hanging fruit that is pickable when you write the first tentative test
cases around a 42,000 line CGI script, scaffolding around globals, turning
strictures and warnings on for blocks that you can pull out of the main
body and so on can give you an exceptional feeling of progress.

But as
much fun as it can be to work around and nurse back-to-health antiquated
tooling, eventually it grinds, and you start wondering if letting the
patient die would be the kindest thing for everyone involved. You find
yourself not delivering your best work, because why cast Perl before swine?
Hand-crafting releases instead of using dzil, non-automated release
processes, and the fear that your changes will blow up parts of the code
that aren=E2=80=99t properly tested is exhausting.

One day you decide you don=E2=80=99t
want to be working the life-support shift, and you=E2=80=99d rather be work=
ing with
a Modern, clean, and sane Perl codebase, using best-practice tooling. And
you realize it=E2=80=99ll make you happy.

The second thing that makes me happy is
working on products that are expanding, and that are growing. To be using
my programming skills to work towards building something excellent, rather
than working to keep the ship floating.

When you=E2=80=99re working to deliver
new, exciting features to customers, as part of a well-thought-through plan
to grow the company and team you=E2=80=99re a part of, work is exciting. Yo=
u know
you=E2=80=99re building things that will improve some small (or large) corn=
er of
the world, and that your work has some actual meaning, beyond generating
the latest batch of TPS reports.

And so it gives me great pleasure to have
a role on the books that fits both criteria:

The codebase is Modern, sane,
and clean, and overseen by technical management that absolutely insist on
keeping it that way;
The company and development team are growing, and the
new technical products you=E2=80=99ll be working on are an absolutely vital=
 (and
consumer-facing) part of that.

If it=E2=80=99s time to move on from your current
role, and you=E2=80=99d relish the opportunity to be consistently happy at =
work,
this is the role for you.

PS: A simple commute is also a huge win, and the
client is near to a major transport hub in Central London.

Desired skills:
Modern Perl experience including exposure to at least some of the following
modern frameworks/tools: Dancer/Mojilicious/Moose/DBIx:Class/Catalyst

Experience of AJAX functionality and integration technologies like SOAP and
REST.

Commitment to testing - experience with Jenkins/Hudson or similar
for continuous integration would be very helpful).
