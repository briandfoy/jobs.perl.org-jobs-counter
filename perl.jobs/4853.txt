our QA staff. You will manage multiple responsibilities which include
responding to operational requests from customers to modify or enhance
existing web-based applications, performing on-call duties for after hours
emergencies regarding operational systems and processes, modifying or
enhancing existing web-based perl/mod_perl applications in accordance with
