Job title: Perl Web Developer

Company name: System Planning Corporation

Internal ID: Web 05

Location: United States, Virginia, Arlington

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
System Planning Corporation is currently building a team of Perl Web
Developers, and is interested in people with Perl as their primary
programming language.

The position is for a entry to mid-level programmer- someone who is capable
of picking up the pieces of a project and turning out a complete system.

We're really trying to build an open source friendly environment, and those
who appreciate such things will enjoy working here. 

Required skills:
Strong Perl skills- must be a competent programmer. You need to understand
the "why", as well as the "how".
Strong Database skills- Preferrably PostgreSQL, but MySQL is also welcome.
Strong Web Development skills- good command of HTML 4.01 strict, XHTML,
java, CSS, and the CGI perl module.
Strong Linux skills- we use Debian as our server platform of choice, but
development environments are up to you.

Desired skills:
Subversion- Code management is done in subversion, so familiarity with it
is a plus.

XML- when appropriate, it's used. Knowledge of XML::Simple is a plus.

Java, Asp, Php- We're in the process of replacing legacy systems in these
languages, so familiarity is a plus.

Flash- We don't really expect anyone to have flash experience for this
position, but hey, it would be nice.

Web Design- We have several graphic designers for print media, but any web
design abilities would be welcome.
