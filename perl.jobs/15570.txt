Description:
ZipRecruiter is looking to expand our engineering team. We are a successful
startup (~4 years old, ~200 employees) and we're still growing rapidly.

We
help employers and recruiters distribute their jobs online and screen their
applicants. We also provide a job search engine and job alert email for job
seekers and other job boards. We have a large number of paying customers
and job seekers using our services. You will have the opportunity to lead
significant projects. We pay market competitive salaries and offer generous
cash bonuses and equity. We are more laid back than the average startup and
more fun than the average BigCo.

We're looking for strong generalist
engineers who are happy to learn new technologies, and are willing to think
like product/business people who personally implement software.

Technologies we use:

Perl, Python, MySQL, Amazon Web Services,
Elasticsearch, Ubuntu

We prefer candidates to be based with us in Santa
Monica, CA.  We're open to remote as well.

Desired skills:
solid software design skills
perl programming in a Linux/Unix environment

SQL
AWS
Elasticsearch
Testing automation
