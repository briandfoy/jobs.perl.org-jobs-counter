Hi,

I am looking for a position as an object-oriented Perl developer. I have
over 7 years of Perl experience in a wide variety of disciplines including
mod_perl/FastCGI/CGI web development; web agents (LWP); database
programming using DBI and MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, and Sybase;
network and socket programming; and GUI construction using Gtk-Perl and
Perl/Tk. I also have 6 years of experience in Linux/UNIX system
administration, including installation, configuration, and maintenance of
SMTP (Sendmail and Qmail), DNS (Bind 4,8, and 9), HTTP (Apache and
Netscape Enterprise Server), file-sharing (Samba and NFS), FTP, IMAP,
POP3, NTP, and other services.

My resume can be viewed at:

  <http://www.FaerieMUD.org/~ged/Resume.html>

and code samples can be had by viewing the online CVS repository at:

  <http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/Icebox/?cvsroot=icebox>

or the CPAN module Class::Translucent.

I live in Lakewood, Colorado, and would prefer a position that would allow
me to continue to live there, be it via telecommuting or location, but
would consider relocating for the right opportunity. I would enjoy working
for a company that cares about code quality, has a casual work atmosphere,
is interested in giving back to the Perl community, and especially one
which offers a continual learning experience. I am passionate and
committed to my craft, and I believe I have a lot to offer to the right
company.

Thanks for reading.
