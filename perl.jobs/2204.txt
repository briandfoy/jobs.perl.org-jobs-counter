Job title: Short Term Perl / XML / DOM / ODBC

Company name: MyTrip LLC

Location: United States, tx, fort worth

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: short term

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Need programmer to configure remote server in a colo,
write code to connect to http://www.nws.noaa.gov/forecasts/xml/

and import weather data into a database via odbc.
also need scripts written to import non well formed
xml flat files into a database that already exists.

Programmer will need to sign document stating that my company owns the work
being written outright, is being compensated fully and will not distribute
the code on the net, use it for someone else, etc. as I have been burned in
the past by not getting things in writing right up front. If you believe
that I should pay someone to write
something that I do not own, please do NOT reply.

A brief technical interview over the phone will be
required.

Opportunity exists for more work on a contract basis.


Required skills:
Perl, XML, Web Services, Soap, odbc. Neural networking
and artificial intelligence is a plus.

Desired skills:
c# or cold fusion useful. Ability to interface with
web services and parse data from a travel related
website onetravel.com and others would be VERY useful.
