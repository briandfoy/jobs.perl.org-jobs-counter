Job title: text parsing script

Company name: Silver Fox

Pay rate: bid

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need someone to build a text comparison and text manipulation script. The
script creates a few files and does some adjustments to the data inorder to
create a final new file. Here are the generic steps to the script. I will
give more details once we decided on a developer. 

1.	At 5 am every day download a csv file via ftp
2.	Parse the CSV file to remove any items from the file that have less
than 5 in the quantity field. Save the file as input.csv
3.	Open input.csv and export certain columns from input.csv to another
file called upload.txt
4.	Once this new file has been made then trigger another perl script
to be run, called secondary_process.pl. 
5.	secondary_process.pl produces a file called transform.csv, do a
comparison between a column in upload.txt and transform.csv so that certain
results in transform.csv change the values in upload.txt

The script will be run on a linux box and part of your job is to install
script and get it working correctly. Please email me a bit about your
skills and also how much you bid to do this project. Please only bid if you
have the time to start this project and finish it by 4/26. Thanks fellow
Perl enthusiasts!
