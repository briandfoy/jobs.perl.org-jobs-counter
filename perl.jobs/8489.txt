Description:
The http://investordna.net site is a wordpress site with a related
newsletter.  We want to read in articles from emails, allow the editor to
format, sort, and delete them.

Then, overnight, we will have cron jobs to update the outgoing newsletter
on iContact using their perl API, and to import the articles into wordpress
to be the new front page of investordna.net.

The scripts have already been started (http://investordna.net/scripts.zip).
 Here is a summary:

CURRENT SCRIPTS (to finish)

The following scripts have already been developed:

editor.cgi

DESC: this script reads all of the received emails into a
"consolidated.xml" file, then allows the user to delete articles, change
their text, change the order, etc.  It uses editor.tmpl template to display
the data.

TODO: The page loads, but the re-writing of the consolidated.xml file
doesn't work yet.  Must add the ability to change the category associated
with the article.  

parseMails.pl

DESC: This reads in emails from the incoming mailbox, parses out articles
and writes out the results as XML

TODO: About 15 more parser methods need to be written - one for each type
of incoming message

uploadMessage.pl

DESC: This uses Net::iContact to upload a message to iContact.	

TODO: You will need to create a free iContact trial account and get the
newsletter to upload properly using this script.

NEEDED SCRIPTS

updateSite.pl 

This script must convert that day's consolidated.xml into a format that can
be imported by WordPress, then import it.  It will run at 1am to make sure
it loads the articles for the correct day.

Required skills:
perl
email parsing via regexp

Desired skills:
WordPress integration
iContact integration
