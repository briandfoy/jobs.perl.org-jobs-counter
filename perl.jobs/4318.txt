Description:
Your desire to stretch your technical prowess by working with some of the
greatest minds in the Perl engineering community will be realized in this
outstanding career opportunity. If you enjoy problem solving and learning,
then our innovative and collaborative environment will serve as a ladder
for your professional development. Utilize your strength developing and
optimizing Perl / mod_perl code in heavy-volume, open-source environments
to contribute significantly to our high-performance systems. Your outgoing
personality and proven Perl acumen will elevate your candidacy for a much
sought after spot on our close-knit and entrepreneurial team. This role is
ideal for the Perl engineer who loves working on a variety of projects
rather than focusing on a single project for months at a time. You must be
a strong enough coder to be able to look at the existing code, determine
whether the problem is at the OS, network or application level, and then
take the proper corrective action. Having some systems administration
background will aid in your troubleshooting. Operations is the "jack of all
trades" Perl group within ValueClick and rewards its elite team members
with ample variety and challenge.

ValueClick is the leading global provider of Internet advertising solutions
for online advertisers and website publishers. As a pioneer of the
performance-based advertising model, ValueClick provides the most
comprehensive portfolio of online advertising solutions. Our clients
include General Motors, Coca-Cola, Heineken N.V., Sara Lee Corp,
GlaxoSmithKline, Citigroup, British Airways, Hyatt Corp, Dell, Expedia, and
Microsoft. We are fanatical about performance, and it's the guiding
principle behind every solution we offer. Our team at ValueClick uses this
premise when working with our customers to identify their goals and
designing a customized advertising solution to deliver the results they
need.

As one of our dedicated and highly regarded Perl Engineers, working from
Santa Barbara OR Westlake Village, you will manage multiple
responsibilities which include responding to operational requests from
customers to modify or enhance existing web-based applications, performing
on-call duties for after hours emergencies regarding operational systems
and processes, modifying or enhancing existing web-based perl/mod_perl
applications in accordance with provided feature specifications, and
performing preventative maintenance on existing applications and services.
You will also be tasked with building new, or maintaining existing,
monitoring applications to provide advance notice of problems that affect
the operational readiness of production systems. Additionally, as our Perl
Engineer, you will have the responsibility for the full lifecycle
development of projects, including developing software functional
specifications based on product requirements, writing code to accomplish
specific goals and assist in preparing and implementing test plans with our
QA staff. Your solid communication skills will play a large role as you
interact with application users in order to identify and debug problems
with operational systems in response to bug tickets. If you desire a
challenge and appreciate being recognized for your efforts, and enjoy being
part of a winning team, you owe it to yourself to explore this opportunity
with a recognized leader in the online marketing space.
