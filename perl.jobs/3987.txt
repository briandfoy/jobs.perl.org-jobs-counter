My client is looking for highly talented software engineer to complement
its development team.

Candidate will be part of a team of developers building complex web based
applications. He or she will be involved in architectural decisions and be
responsible for implementing parts of the system. It will be important for
the candidate to be able to take on a project independently and ensure its
success.

REQUIREMENTS:

o The ideal candidate will be fluent in Ruby as well as proficient with
Ruby on Rails.

Given that these are new technologies, extensive experience developing web
applications in Object-Oriented Perl, Python, or Java can be substituted as
long as a strong desire to work in Ruby exists.

o Experience in JavaScript and CSS is desirable as well as AJAX. 
o A deep understanding of relational databases and SQL is a must. 
o Experience with MySQL, PostgreSql is a big plus. 
o Experience with Linux/Unix is a must.
