Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: UK2 Group

Internal ID: Honeybadger

Location: London, London, London

Pay rate: £35-40k per annum

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
UK2 are looking for two talented Perl developers to expand our development
team.

Our billing systems, provisioning, order process and control panel are all
powered by Perl, and we're moving towards increasing use of Perl to
entirely power our backend, so require more developers.

We strive towards code reuse, decent coding standards and Modern Perl, with
peer code reviews and discussion encouraged. There is also a dedicated QA
team and the codebase is split into development, staging and production
environments.

We colloborate over IRC, with Bugzilla and github issues for bug tracking,
Basecamp for project management, and use Github and Subversion for version
control.  Naturally we make heavy use of open-source software, and
contribute back where possible.  We're sponsoring a room plus beer and food
at the London Perl Workshop this year.

We have a pretty laid back atmosphere, and flexible working - remote
working is fine, with up to 4 days a week at home, and one day a week in
the office (Brick Lane, London).

Developers are free to use Linux or Mac, whichever you prefer (company
laptop may be available).

We have a performance-related bonus scheme; each project is assigned a
bonus category depending on complexity, and accrued bonuses are paid
quarterly - so hard work is certainly rewarded.

We're primarily looking for permanent employees, but contract roles may be
available too.

Required skills:
- At least 2-3 years of Perl programming experience, including object-
   oriented coding, test-driven development

 - At least 2-3 years experience of Unixy systems

 - Strong SQL skills (MySQL in particular)

 - Version control, Subversion in particular

Desired skills:
- Common CPAN modules (DBI, CGI, etc)

 - Knowing your way around the Perl debugger

 - Experience with Dancer web framework

 - Standards based HTML and CSS

 - Experience in the domain registration & web hosting market
