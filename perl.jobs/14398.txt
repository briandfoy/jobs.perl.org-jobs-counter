Data Scientist (m/f) - IT Startup - Berlin - full-time

Company name: itembase GmbH

Location: Berlin, Germany

Pay rate: negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 1 - 2 years with possibility of extension

Description:
Your future colleagues need your help! Join us and work with us as a Data
Scientist (m/f) with a passion for data mining on an ambitious web project.

 
You will have space for your ideas, support from your peers, guidance from
your chiefs.

We are a team of 60 people, ten of us are software developers. We have
short release cycles, and good ideas have an excellent chance of making it
to the live servers quickly. You have a visionary idea? See it come to life
with the help of your colleagues. We have regular tech meetings to discuss
your latest ideas and approaches in search of the most innovative
solutions.

Help us
+ Extending and improving our multi-level information extraction
infrastructure and architecture for the itembase platform,
+ Improving the service quality of our metadata services,
+ Working proactively on our classificatoin and monitoring system,
+ Safekeeping the functionality and quality of the components.

itembase establishes order. Rummaging in drawers, shelves and folders for
receipts, and warranty cards wastes precious time. Since 2011, we have been
using the latest technologies to automatically process receipts and display
items in an easy-to-use personal inventory, along with warranties, manuals,
and invoices... so that our 300,000+ users get to spend more time with
their friends and family.

Required skills:
We need
+ Java, JUnit, Perl, Test::* (or the usual suspects) skills,
+ data mining, recommendation engines, machine learning, statistics,
+ major RDMBS and noSQL databases, “big data” experience,
+ a sharp mind with the ability to grasp concepts and solve problems
quickly,
+ a demonstrated ability to learn by doing and take initiative to "figure
things out”.
