Job title: Entry Level Web Developer

Company name: iAnnounce

Location: Telecommute or London or Brighton, UK

Pay rate: Up to £30,000 DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are a successful company providing specialist online services generating
millions of page views a month for newspapers across Europe. We're looking
to bring on board an entry level web developer who wants to improve his or
her skills and gain experience in a commercial environment.

Initially the role will consist of three main responsibilities:

* Providing 2nd line support for our newspaper partners and consumers.
You'll be working directly with newspaper technical contacts to ensure the
smooth running on the service. Typical issues include formatting issues
with news feeds (provided in a variety of formats including XML and PDF),
updating media assets, and configuring new features and settings for
various sites we manage.

* Creating new sites, including configuring systems; importing, reviewing,
modifying and creating HTML, CSS, images &c.

* Looking after and creating new management reports pulling data from a
variety of source e.g. our databases, Google Analytics, advertising
partners.
Career Progression

We're keen to help you grow as a developer. As you become more experienced
you will become more involved in developing as well as maintaining systems.
We like to try different technologies and approaches, and will encourage
you to do the same as you progress. You'll learn about modern Perl and a
variety of technologies we're playing with such as Plack, Dancer, LESS,
SASS, ElasticSearch, Web Fonts and Responsive Web Design.

We also use Template::Toolkit, mod_perl, MySQL, an in-house ORM, jQuery,
Apache, Linux, Git, memcached, rabbitmq, and have a strong commitment
open-source.

We don't have scrums, but we do chat on IRC and Skype a fair bit.

You'll	be working regular office hours with occasional out of hours cover,
to  be agreed beforehand, and you won't have management breathing down your
 neck. You can telecommute, or work from our London office.  

As a bonus, the whole team attends YAPC::EU every year.

Required skills:
* OO Perl
* Javascript
* Linux, SSH, MySQL, HTML, CSS
* Willing to learn new technologies
* Reliable, helpful, consistent
* Good written and spoken English
* UK-based

Desired skills:
* Git, Apache, memcached
* French, German, Polish, Italian or Danish
