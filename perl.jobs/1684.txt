Job title: Senior mod_perl/Mason Developer

Company name: We Also Walk Dogs

Location: United States, Illinois, Chicago

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 5 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking to retain an experienced mod_perl/Mason developer to help
support one of our high-profile clients.  In this position, you will work
with our client to develop web applications that will be used by millions
of people.

The position is telecommute.  As a result, you must be a self-starter,
capable of taking a project from start to finish without constant direct
supervision.

This is an hourly, contract position.  After a brief, fully paid vetting
period, the position will require a 40	hour/week commitment.  We have more
work than people, however, so additional hours are always an option.  


Required skills:
You must have at least three years of experience developing production web
applications on a Linux/Apache/mod_perl (LAMP) platform.  Ideally, you are
well-versed in HTML::Mason.  Experience with other perl templating systems
(Text::Template, HTML::Embperl) and a burning desire to learn Mason is also
acceptable.

You have extensive experience developing database-backed web applications. 
MySQL experience is preferred.

Since this position requires ongoing interaction with clients and other
developers, you must be able to work in a team.  You will be in email, IM
and phone contact with We Also Walk Dogs developers and our clients, so a
good "user interface" is an absolute must!

Desired skills:
UNIX system administration and IP networking experience is a plus.
