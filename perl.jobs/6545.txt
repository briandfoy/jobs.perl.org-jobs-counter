Job title:
PERL developer for Financial Application w/PostgreSQL

Company name: IgniteTRX

Internal ID: kenn-tx-001

Location: United States, Texas, Dallas /Fort Worth

Pay rate: $30+ Hourly based on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 6 months (plus)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
Extending a GPL'd financial application written in PERL and using
PostgreSQL as the database. The application is web based, Apache 2, Linux,
and some integration with a php app will be required.

All work will obviously need to be released under the GPL. so if you have
an issue with this please don't contact me.

Thanks for your time in reading this.

Required skills:
3 plus years CGI/BIN Perl work	with SQL based database knowledge. Must be
able to work independently, as we do not have an office in the Dallas area.
Some customer interaction is required so you have to be somewhat
presentable :)


Desired skills:
Knowledge of accounting would be extremely valuable as the app covers GL,
AP, AR, etc . Knowledge of human resources, purchasing systems, etc would
also be a big plus. Any knowledge of PHP would make integrating with other
development staff somewhat easier also.
