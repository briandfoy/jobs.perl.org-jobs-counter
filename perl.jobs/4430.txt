Description:
Hi, 

We have several openings for mid-level/senior Perl & Rails developers at
our client sites.

We have openings for Perl/CSS at Amazon. We also have urgent openings for
Perl/Rails developers in Nashville, TN (they have a substantial investment
in Perl and are getting into Rails, too).

If you have a solid background in Perl/LAMP and are interested in the
Nashville jobs, we may be able to train you with our resident Perl/Rails
expert to hit the ground running with Rails.

We develop web apps in Perl and Rails, and we use our knowledge to find
good contract staff and employees for our clients. We're an unusual
staffing/recruiting company, since we actually use the same technology
skills that we look for in others.

Thanks!

Strong OO Perl
Front-end experience with CSS, HTML, DOM, etc.
SQL
