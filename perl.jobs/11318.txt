Job title: Head of Technical Operations (Perl & Sysadmin)

Company name: SpareRoom.co.uk

Location:
United Kingdom, Cheshire, Manchester / Macclesfield

Pay rate: £35,000 - £45,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
SpareRoom.co.uk, the UK's leading flatshare website - and currently the
10th busiest property site in the UK - needs someone to take over the
management and health of its LAMP platform. The application is entirely
written in perl and hosted on centos servers, with a perl back-end glueing
it all together (sending emails, performing db maintenance and other
automated tasks). The role will primarily be focused on the back-end and
platform and so requires sysadmin skills and perl in similar measures.

This is a senior position of great responsibility but within a small team
of 3 (who, although to a greater or lesser extent Linux competent, are not
system administrators). The position is more of a support / coordinating
role than management and requires an all-rounder who is as comfortable with
higher level planning and strategy as they are with the everyday nuts and
bolts work that might be palmed off on a junior in a bigger company.

For a candidate with the right breadth of skills this position could expand
into a fully managerial role as head of technical, managing the front end
side as well (the front and back ends are predominantly procedural code not
OO).

Responsibilities include:

* Monitoring the system, responding to and resolving problems
* Maintaining and expanding the back-end scripts (e.g. adding DKIM to our
email sending scripts)
* Improving platform resilience and disaster recovery procedures (e.g.
planning and testing a procedure for recovering from db failure)
* Capacity planning and server deployment (we currently use dedicated
hosting so the physical hardware is sourced and handled by the hosting
company)
* Managing / Coordinating the code deployment process (we're also keen to
expand our regression testing)

Why SpareRoom.co.uk?

We are a small, friendly (and privately owned) company running a big site.
SpareRoom is the leading site in its field with almost 2 million registered
users and is growing steadily year on year. Despite our size we have the
stability of a larger company, having been profitable for 6 years, and we
remain 100% independent. This means your salary is not dependent on
investment funding that could run out before the company turns a profit.
Working in a small team means you have the opportunity to shape the success
of the company rather than wait weeks (or months) for a committee to
discuss and reject your ideas. 

This role offers the right candidate the opportunity to work for an
innovative and successful market leader whilst enjoying the benefits of
being part of a small, flexible, dynamic (and highly committed) team.

We are based 2 minutes walk from Macclesfield train station (the office
overlooks the platform!), where you can get a 25 minute train to Manchester
(passing stockport which is just 15 mins away), or 15 mins to Stoke on
Trent, or 1 hour 40 mins to London Euston


Required skills:
* Perl
* Apache
* Mysql (inc administation and replication)
* Linux administration, ideally on centos
* Subversion or other version control system

Desired skills:
* mod_perl
* Experience working on a high traffic website (ideally LAMP)
* apple mac
