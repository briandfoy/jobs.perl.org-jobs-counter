Job title: Director Of Engineering

Company name: Elite Digital

Location: Los Angeles, CA

Pay rate: $125k USD + Bonus Up To $75k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
So often, outstanding developers and project leaders of complex systems are
hidden away in the bowels of the Enterprise. NOT in our case. We need a
developer who wants to come out of the bowels and be our Captain Kirk.
You’re bold, adventuresome, and a little bit of risk taker. You thrive on
new challenges. You’re going to be “stunned” over the wide range of new
places (markets, products, geography) you’ll visit in this role. 

You’re
the type of person who likes big rewards for big achievement. There is a
direct correlation between your success here, our business revenue, and
your bonus. This is not a role where someone in an HR cubicle is setting
small compensation increases. This is an opportunity to participate
directly in the profit our company.  We anticipate that the total
compensation for this role with base and bonus will be around $200k.

We’re
an on-line retailing company where the core of our business success is not
the products – it’s the underlying systems and technology. Have you ever
dreamed of being at the front end of a company’s success rather than at the
“backend?”

We’re seeking a high level Perl developer and project leader to
be our Director of Engineering. Elite Digital is an entrepreneurial company
with a stable track record of profitability and solid growth. We work
behind the scenes to sell millions of different products around the world.
If you've ever bought a rare book or cd through Amazon, you probably bought
it from us.

As the Director Of Engineering you'll directly shape the
future of the business. You'll be responsible for choosing the
technologies, selecting vendors, and growing the team. You'll be the
day-to-day leader, strategist, setting the goals, outcomes, and schedules.
You’ll build upon our base of a very sophisticated Perl system to expand
into new countries, markets, and channels.

Our perfect candidate has at
least 6 years of high level Perl development and project leadership working
on complex systems. In addition, you’ve probably got a very strong track
record of designing, administering, and optimizing MySQL databases. You’re
labeled as fluent with CPAN and can easily administer Linux via a command
line.

You’re probably wondering where you have to move to for this
opportunity. You don’t have to move. We’re open to our Director of
Engineering – our Captain Kirk - working from home anywhere in the US. Our
perfect candidate will have already mastered the discipline of
tele-commuting.

If the idea of a challenging role, being at the front end
of a business instead of the backend, and the flexibility to work from home
appeal to you, send us a copy of your resume along with a half-page
write-up of a couple of your most significant Perl development projects of
which you’re most proud.
