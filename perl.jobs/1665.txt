Description:
Follett Library Resources, the leading distributor of books and other media
to school libraries around the world, has immediate openings for an
Application Programmer and a Senior Programmer. As our tremendous success
continues, driven by our innovative website, we are seeking a smart,
curious, positive professional to do great things in our web programming
department.

We use PHP and Perl for a 3-tier application running on Apache on Linux,
with Oracle on Solaris as the backend. We take life-long learning

growth guarantees you will not be bored.  We are agile, productive, and
quickly do our magic through short project cycles.  We're a tightly knit
team, we don't work sweatshop hours, we think programming is fun, and we
take great pride in our accomplishments. No wizards who like to code in a
closet need apply.

Application Programmers will have 2+ years of application programming
experience, with web applications a big plus.

All programmers must be well-versed in object-oriented design and coding,
have experience writing applications, know HTML and SQL, and be proficient
at using shell-based Linux/Unix as a development platform. Excellent
written and verbal communication is a must.

Contact information:
We offer a competitive salary and an excellent benefits package including
medical and dental coverage, a generous 401k plan, profit sharing, flexible
spending plans, full undergraduate tuition reimbursement, earned time off
in the first year and more. We provide a pleasant, non-smoking office
environment in our state-of-the art headquarters and distribution center in
McHenry, Illinois, a far northwestern suburb of Chicago. We prefer
