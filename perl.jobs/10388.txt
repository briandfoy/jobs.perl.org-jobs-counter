Description:
We're looking for a QA Engineer (mid-level and Senior) with a solid
background in IP network device testing, and with recent experience in
scripting and/or programming (Perl is what we use, but can learn if strong
in Python, PHP, TCL, Ruby, C/C++, Java, etc). The position requires a
significant amount of time programming (automating tests or developing

belief.

Develop, extend, execute, and analyze regression, functional and
performance test plans and automation for our products’ network integration
components. 
Utilize understanding of networks and network protocols, as well as
programming skills, to analyze TCP/IP network traces to find implementation
problems, compliance problems, and performance problems with the network
integration components of the Riverbed appliance.  
Identify, setup, test, and troubleshoot various permutations of
software/hardware/network configurations. 
Develop tools, scripts, and programs to implement test automation, using a
powerful collection of in-house frameworks and tools and a fully
VLAN-switched lab. 


Required skills:
B.S. or M.S. in CS, CE, or EE. 
Strong experience with Perl.
Strong experience with IP networking and protocols (TCP/IP, GRE, WCCP,
Policy-based routing, L4 switching, etc). 
Strong experience working with networking appliances devices and tools
(managed switches, routers, caches, Wireshark, Ixia, Spirent Smartbits,
etc). 
Strong logical debugging skills. 
Strong attention to detail. 
Good written communication and documentation skills. 
Experience with Linux/Unix. 

Desired skills:
Python, PHP, TCL, Ruby, C/C++, or Java scripting and/or programming is a
plus.
