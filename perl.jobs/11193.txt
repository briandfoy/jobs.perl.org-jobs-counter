Job title:
Perl Software Engineer sought to help revolutionize an industry

Company name: Shutterstock Images

Location: United States, NY, New York

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Shutterstock loves Perl. We're a stock photo and video company, and we see
ourselves at the forefront of technology and research. We do fascinating
things with search, discovery, recommendation engines, and scalability.
We're looking for great Perl engineers to help us continue to be a leader
in our industry.
 
We're an agile shop, and we focus on close interaction, so you'll have to
be local to the New York area. But if you're awesome enough, we'll move you
out here!
 
If that's not enough, check out these other perks:
 
- All the hardware you want: Our philosophy is that hardware is cheap
compared to your time. If you think it will increase your productivity,
we'll buy it for you.
- Professional development: The more you know, the more valuable you are to
us. So you'll get any tech book you want, and we'll reimburse your tuition
for classes.
- Lots of free goodies: Breakfast, fruit, pizza on Fridays, and even
massages.


Required skills:
A code sample is required;

•We’d like to see something that shows your skill as a Perl programmer, and
your skills as a professional programmer.
•Your code sample should include all pieces necessary to run, including
input files
•Your code sample should not depend on particular directory names
•It should be documented in the Perl style
•You should have the rights to distribute the code to us
•It would be nice if it was packaged as a CPAN-style module (though it need
not be placed on CPAN). See Module::Starter if you need help setting up a
CPAN-style module
We’d especially like to see code that covers one or more of the following
topics:

•Image Manipulation
•Databases
•Batch Processing
•Something you think is relevant to high-volume websites or large amounts
of data.
•Something you think is cool in a computer-science way.


Desired skills:
At least 2 years experience with:
    * Perl
    * HTML / CSS / Javascript
    * MySQL
    * Linux
 
Optional:
 
    * HTML::Mason
    * AJAX
    * layout / design
    * ImageMagick (and PerlMagick)
    * other languages (php, bash, C, etc.)
    * mod_perl / Apache
    * video editing
    * MySQL replication and optimization
