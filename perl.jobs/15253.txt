Job title: PERL Developer

Company name: EasyCruit (Part of Lumesse)

Location:
Home based (with trips to UK) or UK office (Luton - Beds)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for full time developers to join the R&D team to work on our
Recruitment Platform 'EasyCruit'. The role will encompass the full
development life cycle from design to deployment.

Our products are
developed using open source technology and based upon a LAMP stack, so you
will be expected to have at least 3 years' experience of writing web
applications using Perl and MySQL, deployed on Apache Web servers in a
Linux environment. You will have experience using Source Code management
tools and will be expected to participate in peer code reviews providing
constructive feedback, and be prepared to receive the same.

Developers
will be required to produce technical documentation and accurate estimates
so excellent levels of written and verbal English are required. The role
also includes a proportion of bug fixing, so you will need an intelligent
approach to problem solving and analysis.

Desired skills:
- Previous use of Perl / ModPerl, Apache and MySQL to create web based
applications. You should have used Perl modules and packages created by
others and written your own.
- Experience of producing web pages in HTML
and CSS. Ultimately Easycruit renders its pages in HTML, so being able to
produce 'standards compliant' HTML is a must for this role.
- Ability to
support systems and applications in a Linux environment.
- Previous
experience deploying SaaS software in a multi-lingual, multi-site and
multi-country environment.
