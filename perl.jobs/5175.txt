Job title:
Find/Replace Perl Script to Modify .HTM files on server

Company name: Posleap, Inc.

Location: United States, FL, Naples

Pay rate: $20 US (one time fee) via Paypal

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 30-60 Minutes

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need a perl script which modifies all .htm files located in the
~/userhelpguides.com/guide directory on my server.  The perl sript needs to
recursively find all the .htm files in the directory, make the changes
listed below, and then save the new file as a .php 
-----

1) You need to remove all the junk (whatever it may be, ie.. stylesheets,
etc) above the first <table> tag, but before you do, you need to:

Replace the <title>sometitlehere</title> tags with:

<?php $title = "sometitlehere"; include
$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/test/head.php"; ?>

Where 'sometitlehere' is the previous title specified between the <title>
tags.  (I'm using a PHP include to pass in the title to another php page).

2) Next, replace the first <table..*> tag with simply <table>.	 The table
tag varies document to document, so you need to do a match for all <table
..*>

3) Finally, remove the ending </body></html> and replace with:

<?php include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/test/foot.php"; ?>

All the files can be found at:
http://userhelpguides.com/whatyouneed.zip

Here are example files on the server (contained in the zip file above):

http://userhelpguides.com/t/a3.htm is an example of an unmodified page.

http://userhelpguides.com/t/a3-modified.php is how the page should look
after modification

http://userhelpguides.com/t/head.php is the header

http://userhelpguides.com/t/foot.php is the footer.

Thanks!
Josh
