Job title: Perl Web Application Developer

Company name: Incentive Logic, Inc

Internal ID: WD-40

Location: United States, AZ, Scottsdale

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The ever-growing Incentive Logic development team is looking for yet
another Perl developer to come join our team of All-Star developers.

We're looking for an experienced Perl-based web application developer for
an on-site, 40-hour a week position.  We are not considering full time
telecommuters at this time.

Do you love Perl?  Do you want to be programming Perl full-time?  If so, we
want to talk to you!  Experience with developing and maintaining a large
web-based Perl application is a huge plus.

You'll be working on our main platform, adding and extending functionality
to the core system, as well as creating custom changes for some of our
client's specific requirements.  You'll also be implementing service for
new clients as they sign on.  We have some really big clients and some
really cool projects!

Sound good so far?  If so, please send your resume and a code sample to
perljobs@incentivelogic.com.  We understand that a lot of code samples are
proprietary works and cannot be submitted.  We don't need a fully running
application, just a piece of code that you feel demonstrates your knowledge
and understanding of Perl and your ability to write clean, maintainable
code.

About Us:

We are a small-to-medium sized company that's been around for over 9 years,
and we're growing yet again.  Last year, Inc. Magazine ranked us in their
Top 5000 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America, and ranked us at
number 68 on their Top Companies in Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ list.

Our company is a fun, fast-paced, casual environment, in a beautiful office
building in North Scottsdale.  We're close to the freeway and in the heart
of the Scottsdale business world.


Required skills:
* Perl. Duh.

* Web-based applications - This is crucial! Our platform is web-based

* Object Oriented Design and Programming

* The ability to design elegant solutions and creativly solve problems	

* You'll need to document your designs and the code you write (stop
laughing!).

* MySQL knowledge and general SQL know-how

* Linux - You'll need to have enough familiarity to set up and maintain
your own development sandbox

* Communication skills, written and verbal, are essential

* A sense of humor.  Bonus points for sarcasm talent  :-)

Desired skills:
* mod_perl familiarity

* CVS basics

* Apache basics

* Ability to effectively taunt our one developer that prefers PHP over Perl


Since our application is web-based, having knowledge of the following would
help:

* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript
