Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
I-Media Insights is looking for a highly motivated software engineer to
join our team. You will experience the benefits of working at a start up –
a very small team, a very focused mission, outstanding customers and as
much responsibility as you demonstrate desire for without the funding risks
typically encountered with start ups.

This is a critical position – a significant portion of our current workload
is bringing new customers and new ad campaigns on line. As a result, your
primary responsibilities will include:

 - Ad campaign operations engineering – become the technical expert on our
campaign management tools, providing technical support to advertising
operations answering the myriad questions that come up.
 - Sales engineering – with our sales team, work with leading e-commerce
web site during the sales and implementation cycles. You will be the
technical face of our company to our customers.
 - Data operations engineering – our systems run numerous daily data
processing operations for internal and external reporting purposes. You
will be responsible for handling the operational issues associated with
these processes, insuring they run, handling problems when they occur and
building a web-based administrative interface to effectively administer
these processes.


Required skills:
You will need to demonstrate these qualifications during the interview
process:

 - BSCS, BSCE, or BSEE required.
 - Excellent verbal and written communication skills – demonstrating the
ability to clearly and concisely communicate technical details to a mixed
audience in collaborative and adversarial situations.
 - Good software development skills with solid knowledge of Linux, Perl,
SQL and the ability to read and use complex data models. 
 - Strong multi-tasking skills – a typical day will include numerous phone
calls, IM and email with our geographically distributed team, drilling into
various data components to answer questions (using ad hoc query tools as
well as canned reports), sales calls and a moderate-high level of
interruptions.
