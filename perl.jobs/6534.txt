Description:
Shoplet is seeking LAMP Web Developers skilled in both the front- and

seeking to build a team of passionate, team-oriented people.

such as: 

•	Medical Program by Blue Cross Blue Shield (PPO)
•	Sponsored Physical Fitness Program with NY Sports Club
•	401 K Plan 
•	Profit Sharing Plan.
•	Life Insurance
•	Paid Vacation & Holidays
•	Continuing Education Program
•	Flexible spending plan 
•	Associate Discounts and Savings


Required skills:
Web application developer must have experience building flexible,
cross-browser compatible, scalable web applications with 1-3 years of
experience using:

- Perl(CGI), PHP
- JavaScript(Ajax/Json - ok, no one has 3 years of Ajax, but you get the
picture),
- CSS(cross browser) and
- MySQL (data modeling and ANSI SQL)


Desired skills:
Additional consideration will be given to candidates with following
experience:
- XML(Xslt/Xpath, Web Services, DTD/XML Schema)
- UI Development (with Attention to Detail)
- Web Page Design (Web 2.0 / AJAX)
- Technical Specification creation and writing
- Comet, Cometd, Reverse AJAX, etc.
