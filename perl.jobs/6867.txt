Job title:
Perl Rockstar Needed for Web Application Development

Company name: Incentive Logic, Inc

Location: United States, AZ, Scottsdale

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Length of employment: Contract to hire

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You may have seen our postings on Perl Jobs a couple of times over the past
6 months. One position has been filled, and we need one more!

We're looking for an experienced Perl web application developer for a
contract-to-hire position, doing web-based Perl application development.

We are a fun, small-to-medium sized company that's been around for over 9
years, and we're growing (and growing and growing and growing)! We're
looking for the right person to join our all-star team of developers.

We're looking for someone LOVES Perl.  If that's you, and you want to be
programming Perl full-time, we want to talk to you!  Experience with
developing and maintaining a large web-based Perl application is a must.

You'll be working on our main platform, adding and extending functionality
to the core system, as well as creating custom changes for some of our
client's specific requirements.  You'll also be implementing service for
new clients as they sign on.  We have some big clients and some really cool
projects!

You may be called upon to assist with writing Requirements Docs, Technical
Specs, Implementation Notes, etc, from time to time.  You'll need to
document code you write (stop laughing!).

Our company is a fun, fast-paced, casual environment, in a beautiful office

building in North Scottsdale.  We're close to the freeway and in the heart
of the Scottsdale business world.

Are you the next to join the family?  If so, please send your resume and a
code sample to perljobs@incentivelogic.com.  We understand that a lot of
code samples are proprietary works and cannot be submitted.  We don't need
a fully running application, just a piece of code that you feel
demonstrates your knowledge and understanding of Perl and your ability to
write clean, maintainable code.

This is an onsite position and we are not considering telecommuters at this

time.


Required skills:
* Perl. Duh.  Do you live and breath it? Is Perl the One True Language(tm)?

* Web-based applications - This is crucial! Our platform is web-based
* Object Oriented Design and Programming
* The ability to design elegant solutions and solve problems
* MySQL knowledge and general SQL know-how
* Linux - You don't need to be a kernel contributer; having enough
familiarity to set up and maintain your own dev box will suffice.
* Communication skills, written and verbal, are essential
* A sense of humor  :-)


Desired skills:
* mod_perl familiarity
* CVS basics
* Apache basics
* Ability to effectively taunt our one developer that prefers PHP

Since our application is web-based, having knowledge of the following would
help:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
