Job title:
Perl/mod_perl/Apache/SSL developer for innovative security product

Company name: www.programEz.net

Location:
Preferably from Europe for time zone considerations

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I'm loking for developers for a new security product I have based on Perl,
Apache and SSL, able and willing to invest (at least) time in developing it
further. 
I reckon the idea is innovative and with lots of potential to generate
revenue in short time after finishing it, and hopefully so should you.
I'm not able to pay you, so you should be able to support yourself during
development (estimated 3-4 months) or keep your present position and work
part time.
In the end though, I offer to share everyting that will produce and become
fully partners in the new start-up.

Required skills:
- Perl, mod_perl (handlers), Apache and SSL, with more experience than me
;-)
- Perl network programming with some experience on SSL encrypted
communications.

Desired skills:
- C/C++/Java network programming with accent on SSL encrypted
communications.
- Business oriented mind able to take care of the business related part of
the new start-up (not only development).
