Job title: QA Software Engineer - Network Integration

Company name: Riverbed Technology

Internal ID: 2006

Location:
United States, CA, San Francisco, Sunnyvale or Champaign IL

Pay rate: Open

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Full Time

Description:
Like analyzing and breaking complex systems?
Excited by virtualization and networking?
Ready to work on something big?

We’ve got the job for you.

You’ll be working on serious software that 60 of the 100 biggest global
companies put in the core of their networks.  You’ll be surrounded by
experts in the field, but be empowered to forge your own path.	You’ll have
the right tools – from a hands-off, fully-automated lab with a few thousand
machines at your disposal, to a test code library built so that you
concentrate on your test logic, not the trivial stuff.	We understand that
you need just enough of the right processes, so you’ll take part in code
reviews and use proven documentation and progress tracking standards that
help us build and test rock-solid products.  And most importantly, you’ll
have new challenges at every turn.

We’re a fun group that feels more “Web 2.0” than “Big Company.” You can run
Mac OS, Windows, or Linux with double monitors and your favorite ergo
keyboard – we don’t care, as long as it fits your style.  Enjoy the near by
University of Illinois college campus setting with terrific restaurants,
nightlife, fascinating lectures and world-renowned speakers. 

Full-time –San Francisco, Sunnyvale or Champaign IL

You will:
•	Develop, extend, execute, and analyze regression, functional, and
