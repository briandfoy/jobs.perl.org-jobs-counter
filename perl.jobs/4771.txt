Job title:
Volenteer Websearch with a passion for documentary film

Company name: e screening room

Location: United States, CA, San Rafael

Pay rate: $0

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
This is not for the faint of heart ! If you have time to hammer this out in
the next three weeks let us know… 

We are looking for a volunteer web developer with a passion for documentary
films and in support of the freedom of speech, with experience with some C,
some shell experience. We are using agile (extreme) programming methods. We
already have a working model up http://tataboom.com/widgetview.cgi but we
need to refine the search. We can’t pay you anything but you get to create
the best documentary film search engine with a billion dollars in hardware
behind it.. 

The none-profit e screening room  http://escreeningroom.org/ is dedicated
to connect independent documentary film makers with their audience. We have
on-line website dedicated to viewing unabridged independent documentary
films. One can watch now or DVD copy for home viewing. We are non-profit
organization. The e screening room is entirely created by volunteer work.

Independent documentaries are born out of the passion –often compassion -
for the subject of the documentary. Often these documentaries are self
financed.  But there is little financial gain out of documentary film. As a
result, documentary producers get discouraged and often leave the field. We
think that’s a shame: to lose an independent voice, is a loss for a free
society. At the e screening room we are changing that by connecting
documentary filmmakers with their audience. 


Required skills:
PROJECT:
Alexa.com is sponsoring us to build the best search engine for documentary
films. Alex.com does a daily crawl on the web and is giving us access to
the crawl. This should enable us to build a search that 1) Identifies
documentary films only (media) and 2) identifies descriptions/reviews of
documentary films. Estimated time for basic functionality 40hr (must be
done in three till four weeks).
