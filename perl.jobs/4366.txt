Job title:
CHRISTIAN 'bot' autofiller conversation stuff

Location: United States, mi, roseville

Pay rate: auction/depends

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: contract

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
must be multiplatform/autoconversation filler type 'bot'
save conversation that i've had, and autofill that in the future with
exactly the same conversations. ie; at first it would be almost useless,
just recording everything i say.... but eventually, after 200 conversations
or so, it would be incredibly useful - especially for small direct
conversations.
when it doesn't know what to say/autofill, it should pop up a menu, and
either A) let me finish the conversation or B) let me put in a sentence or
two & let me send it to another part in the conversation (shortcut) - when
i answer conversation, it should be able to run perl/other scripts. ie;
saying 'my name is james /key' could save the conversation as 'my name is
james', and then /key could be an operator that could either be defined
there or elsewhere - possibly saving the operator itself in the save file
to be used in the future as well.

i have a couple of different multiplatforms that i've been suggested to use
- this project does not have to be from scratch :D - dont care how it's
done as long as it gets done. 

1) it should be able to be multiplatform (aim/yaho/msn/others); i have a
multiplatform base that i think would help that is written in perl.
2) it should be able to save conversation & autofill;  pop up a menu when
it doesnt know what to say for input
3) it should be able to have multiple conversations at once; ie complete
conversations even as it's awaiting my response to a question.. even if it
has 2 or 3 windows  up & awaiting my response.
4) it should be able to use perl/other commands; shortcuts to parts of
conversation in particular
5) ease of install would be a big plus :D
6) should have the ability to look at and edit the database; hopefully
something fairly easy to understand
7) it should pop up a menu when it doesnt know what to say
8) should be able to save each conversation topic as a 'brain', and be able
to start a new 'brain' easily as needed that can be switched between
quickly.


Required skills:
perl/other language useful for the project

Desired skills: Christian
