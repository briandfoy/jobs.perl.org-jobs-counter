Job title: Perl Developer to create CPAN API

Company name: UWT

Location: United States, NY, New York

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: < 1 week

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a developer to write an API in Perl to a well documented
Digital Asset Management system.  The system should be built using Moose,
LWP, and XML::Simple (or some other XML generation module).  The API being
integrated with uses XML requests and responses transported over HTTPS.  It
however does not use an existing standard such as SOAP, or XML-RPC.  This
API should be built as a CPAN module with the goal to eventually release it
to CPAN (under your name of course).

Required skills:
- should have experience creating CPAN modules
- should be well versed with LWP
- should be well versed with generating XML in Perl
- should be well versed with Moose
- should be well versed with DBIx::Class
- should be well versed with a test suite, and with good testing practices

Desired skills:
- should have time to start work on this immediately.  I anticipate this is
3-4 days of work for an experienced developer.
- should be able to demonstrate experience with all listed Perl Modules via
code samples.
