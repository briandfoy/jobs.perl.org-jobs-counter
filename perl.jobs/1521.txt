Job title:
Programmer Analyst with Mason and/or Oracle experience

Company name: Rentrak Corporation

Internal ID: Ovid

Location: United States, Oregon, Portland

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you don't mind pair programming, test-driven development, Mason, Perl,
no overtime and your choice of OS to develop on, come work for Rentrak
(http://www.rentrak.com/.)

We actually don't care if you know Perl or Mason. We care about whether or
not you are a good programmer. You can learn Perl and Mason on the job.

We process business intelligence for the entertainment industry.  We
receive huge amounts of data from companies.  We fold, spindle, and
mutilate it.  We give it back to them.	They pay us for this.  Seriously! 
Of course, because we use Perl, we do this much better than our competitors
and we're growing pretty darned fast.

We're located in beautiful Portland, Oregon (near the airport, if that
means anything to you.)

NO recruiters.	None.  Zero. Zip.

At this time, we do not have any telecommuting positions nor can we sponsor
an H1B visa.  Sorry, folks.

Required skills:
We're looking for someone with either a strong Perl background or a light
Perl background with a strong programming background.	An interest and
enthusiasm for programming in general is always appreciated.

Desired skills:
Knowledge of system administration, database design, and ability to leap
binary trees in a single-bound are always appreciated.

Send your resume to Curtis "Ovid" Poe at cxp@rentrak.com.  It will bypass
HR and be forwarded directly to the hiring manager.
