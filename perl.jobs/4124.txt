Job title:
Software Engineer, Web and Data Services for Mobile Music

Company name: Groove Mobile

Internal ID: SEWDS

Location: United States, MA, Andover

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Overview

Groove Mobile is currently seeking a Software Engineer for the team
developing our back-end services. This group is responsible for designing
the core services and database systems for our mobile music platform. If
you want to be challenged by working in a small, aggressive, fast-paced,
start-up software development team where you can have an impact in many
areas then this might be the job for you.
Role

Your role will be to design, implement, and ensure the quality of key
components of our server system. You will provide feedback on architecture
and feature specifications from other groups within Groove Mobile and our
partners. You will also help define processes that will make your job
easier and make the team more efficient. You need to be a
jack-of-all-trades for this position because you will work on all areas of
our server systems but the primary focus in the near future is to create
web services and expand our database designs to scale as our business
grows.
Responsibilities

    * Develop and maintain the back-end APIs for multiple types of in-house
and customer applications.
    * Design and enhance database schemas and data-flow processes to
support operational and reporting requirements.
    * Enhance, develop and maintain customer-facing tools for business
report generation and presentation.
    * Enhance, develop and maintain tools that assist technical support
reps.
    * Independently manage project schedules to deliver the above.
    * Document tools and processes on the company’s internal wiki site

Fit

To be a good fit for our team, you need to be an excellent communicator,
written and orally. You need to like working with others but you still must
be someone who can work independently and take initiative to solve problems
on their own. To succeed at Groove Mobile, you must have the ability to
focus on several tasks at once, juggling priorities as needed, and you need
to be able to identify functionality versus schedule tradeoffs under
pressure.

Required skills:
    * You have non-trivial experience with Perl and are willing to grow
that. Having Java knowledge is a plus too and you know that different
languages are right for different tasks.
    * You've built web services with just HTTP, Web Services with SOAP, you
know the difference, and you know when to use one instead of the other.
    * You've designed non-trivial database schemas, preferably to support
e-commerce. Non-trivial means more than ~50 tables with extensive
foreign-key relationships with some tables having millions of records.
You've designed both operational and reporting databases and understand why
the two have different requirements and should be designed differently.
    * You've managed technical project schedules that involve multiple
people from different areas of the company.
    * You're completely comfortable with Unix/Linux operating systems.
    * You've built dynamic web interfaces to back-end databases with HTML
and Perl/PHP/etc.
    * You have strong analytical and problem solving skills, multitasking,
attention to detail
    * You should have a BS in computer science or equivalent experience.
For you to be good at all of this, you've probably been at it for about 5-7
years.
