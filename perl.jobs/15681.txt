take the lead on various projects. This part of your job will require you
to discern requirements, specify work, and delegate tasks to a small team.

Desired skills:
Required Education or Experience:

Previous experience as a senior
developer
5+ years experience as a developer
Significant participation or
ownership of a published open source project.
