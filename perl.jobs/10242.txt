Job title: Payment API Integration

Company name: Individual

Location: Guatemala, Huehuetenango, Huehuetenango

Pay rate: n/a

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: bid on project

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need an integration of a payment API offered by www.LiqPay.com. They
offer many tasks instructions in their API but I only want you to code one
task. An "Account to Account Transaction". Every account with LiqPay is
opened under a cell phone number, (not email address like PayPal),  LiqPay
has the quickest and easiest money transfers in the internet. They only ask
you for a cell number to open an account, (no name, no address, etc). The
cell number is used in two instances, they send a unique password by SMS
each time you want to login to your account and they send payment
notifications by SMS and not email.  So if you are interested in helping me
for a fee, look at the liqpay API for instructions at
www.liqpay.com/?do=pages&p=api. Once you reach this URL you need to look
for the third line from the top where it says: "Money Transfer from
Merchant`s LiqPAY account to another phone". This is the task I need and no
other.
To test your code you need to open a SHOP which is free and make Pay
Buttons. Find the ADD SHOP link, (on the top right corner of their Home
page). Only your cell number is requested to open a shop then you can
create Pay Buttons in less than 3 minutes. They will even give you money
for testing their services. Go to www.liqpay.com home page and in the
center of the page towards the bottom you will find they give you 5 cents
American USD as a gift. If you get stuck or run into trouble LiqPay offers
24 hours TECH SUPPORT via LIVE CHAT. Please quote me how much you wish me
to pay you,  and how long you need to complete the task). Thank You. 

Required skills: perl parsing of XML files
