Linux skills to work onsite in midtown, New York City. We're seeking a
hands-on programmer with the ability to customize, build, manage and
enhance large scale, open source and home-grown applications for enterprise
use. The development process is not formalized and you will be required to
wear several hats at times, and be involved from analysis and design
through testing, implementation and support of live systems.  You will be
very influential in shaping the future of our business.  We will trust your
judgement and rely on your foresight for all technical issues.	To start,
you will be working with 2-3 other programmers. 


Required skills:
Required Skills: 
• Linux/Open Source approach to systems deployment and software
development. 
• Proficient in Perl for both mod_perl application interface development
and backend data-processing. 
• Ability to maintain our servers (running Linux using the Apache
webserver) as well as provision new servers (you must have experience
administering servers, changing hosting companies, migrating from one
server to another, etc). 
• Experienced in HTML, Javascript, Perl, MySQL (database
design/optimization), DNS, and Apache. 
• Email processing and experience with qmail preferred, but not critical if
you’re willing to learn it. 


Desired skills:
Desired Skills: 
• Experience with MySQL Performance Tuning, Perl Code Optimization, and
Load Balancing with LVS preferred.
• Creative approach to problem solving and can-do attitude.  When you
communicate an issue or problem, you provide (or indicate you'll provide) a
recommended solution, next steps, timing...etc.
• Forward thinker who continually asks, “If the number of clients doubled
next month, what would we need on the technical side?"
• Ability to check and troubleshoot your own work.
• Ability to interface directly with non-technical end-users. 
• Self-starter who can work independently while managing your resources to
complete tasks in a timely manner.
