Job title:
Senior Web Application and Database Developer

Company name: Karmasphere

Internal ID: minion02

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
A senior developer is required to architect, produce and manage
product lines in Perl, including web sites, databasing tools,
statistical packages and control software.

The senior Perl developer will work very closely with the head of
engineering and other developers within the company to bring products
into existence according to agreed specifications and timelines.

The existing codebase has been subject to the company quality assurance
procedures. The job will include an element of process management,
including maintaining quality assurance for code produced by other
Perl programmers within the company.

The company addresses the spam problem with a reputation approach.

Required skills:
The company develops software using Catalyst, Class::DBI, DBIx::Class
and SOAP::Lite, and makes very heavy use of standard CPAN modules. The
candidate must also be familiar with the standard Perl APIs for
networking and databasing. SQL is required. Some knowledge of other
languages, possibly C and Java, would be useful, as would a basic
understanding of testing and coverage. XS is not required.

Familiarity with opensource development methodologies, cvs/svn/svk, emacs
or vi, and Linux are required.


Desired skills:
Ideally, you have experience working in a startup environment, with
distributed teams, and within the culture of opensource.  You should have
already developed a previous database-backed web application.  You should
have some experience with managing mail servers on a hobby or professional
basis, and with antispam approaches and technologies such as SpamAssassin.

You may be anywhere in the world, as long as you have a broadband
connection at home and the ability to chat on Skype.  Preference will be
given to UK applicants as much of the development team is already based
there.
