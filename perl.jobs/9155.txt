Job title:
Entry Level Web Developer (mostly in Perl)

Company name: Community Software Lab

Location: United States, MA, Lowell

Pay rate: 16K / yr + basic health insurance

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 1 year

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have a successful directory of community services: MVHub.com

The site is written using CGI::Application , Test::More ,
Test::WWW:Mechanize , etc

We'd like to reproduce this success at North Shore Portal and in other
places around the state and country.

To this end we want to:

  1. Improve our process for making software.

  2. Improve the software

SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
Our software engineering process is pretty typical. We score a between 4
and 5 on on the Joel test. Joel test. We'd like to score an 11. For example
we've used and benefited from version control software for years, but we
don't use bug tracking software.

EXAMPLE SOFTWARE FEATURE IMPROVEMENT
Right now our software sucks less than the competition. We'd like it to
actually be good. One place we can improve is to make it easier for google
and our competitors to grab our data.

If we provide data dumps at zero $ cost and without licenses that prohibit
competition, our organization will gain many partners. People who want to
build better directories will have the tools to do this.


To apply for this position you need:

  1) to be a citizen or a permanent resident (have a green card)

  2) to be willing to work fulltime for $16,000 per year and basic health
insurance

This is an Americorps/VISTA spot, you give a year of service and get
(barely) enough to money to live on, the satisfaction of improving the
world and some experience.

If you are finding it hard to find work because you don't have that crucial
first year of experience, or if you want to avoid the stigma of a gap in
employment during the recesion, we can be a good fit for you.

To apply see: 

Required skills:
Perl or the willingness to learn it. 


Desired skills:
Testing
Design
Project Estimating
