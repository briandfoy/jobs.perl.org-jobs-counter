Job title: Extend a Perl Dancer based RESTful API

Company name: zootzone.com

Location: Cape Town, South Africa

Pay rate: $55/hour

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We're a hosting company, based in South Africa, building a new hosting
platform, currently under heavy development.

Specific to Perl, our domain registration API is built with Perl Dancer,
which we'd like to extend.

It consumes EPP/XML on the registry side (EPP::Simple) and exposes JSON via
a RESTful API to our control panel, which is built using Python/Flask.

This job post is for extending the domain API to integrate with a second
domain registry in addition to enhancing the existing integration.

Technologies in use: Linux, Perl, Python, nginx, PostgreSQL, qmail,
qpsmtpd, dovecot, Ansible, Git.

Possible future work will involve helping to design and build the web and
email hosting APIs, which the control panel will consume, depending on your
performance and rapport with the team.

If you're a seasoned expert with boat loads of experience and a great track
record, the rate is negotiable.

You must live in a timezone with at least 4 hours of overlap with our
working hours, namely 8am-5pm GMT+2

Required skills:
- Strong Perl background.
- RESTful API experience.
- Worked with Perl Dancer or other modern Perl frameworks.
- EPP and/or XML experience.
- Linux/UNIX experience.

Desired skills:
- Good grasp of the domain system.
- Structured and organised coding habits, with clear commenting.
- Preference for simple, elegant systems over complex ones.
- Experienced git user.
- PostgreSQL.
- We use Slack, Github and Pivotal Tracker for development.
