Description:
Hi,

We're Freeside Internet Services, a small software company.  We write and
support an open-source billing and CRM application for ISPs and VoIP
providers.

We're looking for developers to help us extend our open-source application
for our customers.  The work consists of designing and implementing new
features both small and large, as well as maintaining the code, incremental
refactoring, documentation and providing assistance to our support folks.

We're a small, distributed company.  Our employees and contractors work
remotely.  We're looking for folks who are comfortable working
independently, and who can be a responsible and communicative part of our
team.

In your response, I'm looking for:

A CPAN ID, github URL or other code examples.  A few words about how you
think you'll be a good fit.  Don't bother just fishing your resume - if
this sounds like a good position for you, take a few minutes to tell me why
and we can start a conversation about it.  :)
