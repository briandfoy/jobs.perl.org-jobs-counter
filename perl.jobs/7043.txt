Job title:
Senior LAMP Developers needed! Must be comfortable with adult content!

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Senior Software Engineer – Linux/Apache/Mysql/Perl
 

We are a small, San Francisco-based company seeking a lead software
engineer/architect to take over development of our subscription-based adult
video web site. You will work with our fabulously talented product manager,
marketer, and engineering support to improve our service and take it to new
levels of traffic and success.

 

You must be extremely skilled in the following technologies, so that you
can both keep the current site running and extend it:

 

Linux (packaging systems, network configuration, debugging, tweaking) 
Perl (in the form of command line scripts, cgi scripts, and complete
libraries) 
Apache (building and tweaking the 1.3 variants, and the mod_perl module) 
MySQL (SQL and performance tuning) 
Java (from servlets to applications; including Hibernate, Spring, Log4j and
other open source java libraries/frameworks) 
Subversion
 

Additionally, you must be very familiar with the following technologies
that you will encounter, or the ability to quickly come up to speed on
them:

 

C/C++ 
Python 
MPlayer/FFmpeg
 Lucene 
Lighttpd 
Perlbal
 

 

You possess the skill-sets of both a system administrator and programmer.
You can set up and configure a server to make it do what you want; you can
discover, configure and compile applications to make them do what you want;
and you can write the code to customize and tie all these things together.
There is no part of a system that you are afraid to venture into, nor do
you find application writing boring or too complex.

 

You are a developer who can do anything that you put your mind too; and you
live and breathe open source software. You are goals focused, and take
great pride in completing and optimizing working applications. You can
communicate with business people to find out what needs to be done and how
it should be prioritized, and you have the confidence and skill to make it
happen. You know the latest tools and technologies that are available that
might replace what we’ve got. You actively seek this information and are
always looking for better ways to do things.

 

Finally, you have no problem serving up gigabytes and gigabytes of
pornography. In fact, you find the challenge of pushing out a sustained
3Gb/s of pornography to be an extremely interesting engineering problem.
