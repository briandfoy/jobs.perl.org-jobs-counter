Travel: 0-25%

Hours: Full time

Description:
RealNetworks Germany is looking for a skilled and experienced Software
developer, who will be working on various international projects. Main
focus - especially in the beginning  - will be the relaunch and extension
of a RealNetworks music service.  
  
The candidate will work as a full member of our existing team of developers
in Hamburg  and will be working with the currently used systems as well as
contributing ideas and experience  to keep  
efficiency and scalability of the systems at a top level. At the same time
the candidate will contribute ideas and experience when it becomes
necessary to change the used systems to meet the requirements  of our high
trafficked and high performing websites.   
 
Generally, the candidate will be working on conception, code development
and optimization, functionality and feature changes, technical re-designs, 
project launches, DB conception and ERD design. 
 
Due to time- and revenue critical projects and communication between widely
separated time zones, willingness to work at unusual times is necessary
even if this will only happen from time to time or in 
critical phases. 

Required skills:
OO Perl, Catalyst Framework, OO PHP 4+5, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle),
Linux, Apache, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, XML, CVS & SVN, Fluent in English and
