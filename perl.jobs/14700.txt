Description:
Department Profile
Application Infrastructure (AI) strives to maximize the business
application developersâ€™ productivity by centrally providing the core
development lifecycle tools, core reusable software libraries and
middleware thus minimizing duplicative efforts across silos. Our goal is to
provide infrastructure that is broadly reusable, scalable, reliable and
highly performant to meet the demanding needs of our applications.
This department is responsible for providing technical expertise in many
aspects of computing, including Java, C++, .NET, web technologies, and
dynamic languages (Perl, Python, etc.), to help developers in constructing
applications either directly or through the provision of toolkits and
middleware components.

Team Profile
MSDL is the Dynamic Languages toolkit group - MSDL engineers and supports
Perl, Python and other dynamic languages. Perl is very widely used within
the firm. Perl is used for large infrastructure components like aurora,
vms, database and network management. It is also used for text processing,
report generating, etc. 
Several major releases of Perl, Python and R are actively maintained.
Accompanying each release are many libraries, most of which are from the
open source community, but a substantial number are in house developed and
maintained. The MSDL team is relatively small and uses an open source
collaborative approach to harness other groups efforts.


Primary Responsibilities 
Perl is used widely in a great variety of ways at the Firm. Creating a
enviroment for Perl developers that enables them to be effective and
efficient is the main goal.
In order to do this there is a variety of main responsibilities. Foremost
the development and maintenance of in house Perl modules. Maintenance of
modules is exacting work, as a large number of critical systems depend on
them, so good testing frameworks and source control are a must. Git and
Perforce are used for source control and the standard Perl Test::Harness
and prove tools are used. 

Aiding developers with issues, trouble shooting and analyzing issues is an
important task as well. Installing external modules using an inhouse
building tool will be part of the responsibilities.
The group occasionally offers training in the supported languages, mostly
to guide developers in firm specific approaches.

Tasks
- improve Perl deployment at the Firm
- help developers with Perl related problems
- develop Perl modules for internal use
- do root-cause analysis on issues, down to Perl C and XS issues
- help with technical problems with installing modules from CPAN
- enhance, develop and deliver training materials
