Description:
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute has an expanding scientific programme
dedicated to using natural and experimental genetics to understand the role
of genes in health and disease.

The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) is a world leader in genomic
research (Human Genome Project) and the characterisation of sequence
variation (The SNP Consortium, HapMap project). The success of the Welcome
Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC - http://www.wtccc.org.uk/) in
discovering risk genes for seven common diseases has propelled a new
exiting programme, WTCCC2, to investigate over twenty disease phenotypes by
large-scale genotyping and sequencing in 120,000 patient samples. We are
seeking informatics specialists to undertake vital steps in data
processing, analysis and dissemination.


Required skills:
We seek an individual to develop and maintain the WTCCC site, which is used
both for public data release and secure information sharing within the
consortium. You should have extensive experience of programming PERL in a
UNIX/Linux environment and of RDBMS, creating and maintaining production
websites using the APACHE Webserver Software, and Javascript. A flair for
good site design and an understanding of the security issues is also
required.
