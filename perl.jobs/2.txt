Hi,

The Perl Jobs site at http://jobs.perl.org/ is going to open Real Soon
Now.

It will be announced widely when we open and will not yet be too crowded,
so that will be a good time to have a job posting on the site! Please get
in touch with ask@perl.org if you have (or know about) a Perl related job
opening you want announced on the new site.

Also, if you want to include the Perl Jobs content on your site, please
get in touch so we can work out what you'd like and prepare it. (RSS files
and such is what is planned before we open).

:-)
