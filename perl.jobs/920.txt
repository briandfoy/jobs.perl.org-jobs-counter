Job title: SOAP programmer for EU project

Company name:
Tampere University, dept. of Information Studies

Location: Finland, Tampere

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 1.8.2003-31.1.2004

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Taking over my current position of developing SOAP::Lite wrappers. The
components wrapped are a freetext search engine and language translation &
analyzing tools.

This is an EU collaborative project so you might be required to attend some
meetings abroad.

Required skills:
Knowledge of Perl and C. C is used for faster interfacing with some
components. 

Knowing Finnish language is almost essential as your working environment
will be in Finnish, but you might survive without.

Desired skills:
Knowing Perl internals would help, since you might be  expected to create
or maintain extension(s).

Knowing Inquery (freetext search engine), it's API and query language is a
definite plus. Knowing that such components as normalizers and
morphological analyzers exist might lessen your confusion when you start
the job.

Please ask me more if anything is unclear.

bemmu.sepponen@uta.fi

Application deadline is 25.6.2003.
