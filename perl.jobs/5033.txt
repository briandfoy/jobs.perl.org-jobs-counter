Job title:
Experienced Perl Web Developer Central London

Company name: 123Doc Medical Courses

Internal ID: WEBDEV2

Location: United Kingdom, London, London

Pay rate: NEGOTIABLE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are an online education company providing online and interactive
revision, study, exams, videos, reading content, jobs listings and many
other services for doctors, hospitals and medical universities.

We are seeking a Senior PERL Web Developer to join our small, vibrant team
located in the heart of Central London.

The position will require you to work both autonomously and with others,
leading projects, training and working within a small, friendly team.

The candidate will have a track record of maintaining their code with
meaningful comments and keeping well-written documentation.

Although we specialise in providing resources for doctors, no previous
medical knowledge is required.

Applicants should send a covering letter by email to russell@123doc.com,
enclosing a CV and providing examples of relevant code and previous
projects.

Selection will be by interview, at which candidates may be asked to provide
examples of their code if they have not already done so upon application.

Required skills:
Extensive knowledge and experience of Perl (including object oriented
Perl), a strong knowledge of SQL (preferably including exposure to MySQL)
and the Web Development process are essential. The successful candidate
will have relevant experience or strong familiarity in working within and
running all aspects of a popular website.

Desired skills:
PHP is desirable and an understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is
desirable; knowledge of the Template Toolkit Perl module would also be
helpful but is not essential. A background in Linux (and Systems
Administration) would be an advantage. A high standard of written English
is required.
