About Us: 

We are a company based in Pasadena, CA, but we will be moving to Long Beach

in the Summer of 2004. Our business is e-commerce & transaction 
processing. We also do consulting (web/application design as well as
back-end 
work), and also a bit of hosting and security work. We are relatively small

but expanding very rapidly; our lean-and-mean approach to business has kept
us 
alive and thriving while the rest of the IT industry is experiencing major 

recession. We have a strong commitment to open source & free software and 
prefer someone who does as well. 

Job Description:

customers, other developers and the sales staff. Duties will include 
programming internal tools for Q.A. or reporting, dealing with technical
and 
integration support issues with customers and supporting the sales team on 

technical issues. There may also be some work in integrating our API into 
third party products, as well as assisting developers on consulting
projects. 
This person's ability to communicate, learn new skills, and manage their
own 
time are as important as technical and programming skills. We are seeking 
someone who enjoys working on a wide variety of projects with a wide
variety 
of tools. 

Responsibilities: 

 Developing Q.A / Reporting Tools 
 Integrating with Third Party Platforms 
 Customer Technical Support
