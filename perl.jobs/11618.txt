Job title: Senior Perl Programmer

Company name: AOL

Internal ID: 121912BR

Location: USA, VA, Dulles

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Few teams have as broad an exposure to the AOL back office as we do. We're
the glue that integrates systems, automates processes, and simplifies user
experiences. We support legal, HR, identity management, access management,
compliance, corporate communications, help desk, and a host of other
customers with global web applications for AOL employees.

AOL employees are more mobile than ever, and one of our challenges is to
develop mobile, yet secure versions of internal applications. We're also
challenged with making complex back-ends look surprisingly simple for our
users.

Your role is to help evolve the process and systems that keep AOL in legal
and regulatory compliance, and help keep data flowing between systems as
efficiently as possible. All the while keeping a pleasant user experience
in mind

Required skills:
- 1 persistent. Some stuff is hard to figure out. We need someone who
doesn't give up until we understand the problem and fix it.

- 2 honest. Tell it like it is. We can handle the truth.

- 3 Perl: primary language for the systems we support. 1+ years of work
experience.

- 4 Object-Oriented Programming: many systems leverage an object-oriented
framework. 5+ years of work experience.

- 5 SQL applications: heavy use of SQL and stored procedures in Sybase and
MySQL. 4+ years of work experience.

- 6 Web Services: understanding of how to build and deploy web services on
Apache using Perl CGI. HTML, Javascript and JQuery knowledge helpful. Java
servlet deployment on Tomcat also helpful.

- 7 Linux OS: comfortable editing (i.e. vi), debugging and building
applications in Redhat/CentOS platforms. Basic Linux System Administrator
skills helpful.
