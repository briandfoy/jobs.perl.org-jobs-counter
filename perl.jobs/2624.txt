Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Excellent Developers Needed

We're looking for hackers who love working with people.

You're the kind of person who has always excelled at whatever it is you do,
and can pick up new skills at the drop of a hat. You love working with
other excellent people, but are equally comfortable sitting in front of a
blank sheet of paper and molding reality. You know that you can do the
impossible if only you would be given a little bit more time, but you also
know you can accomplish a whole lot more if you work with trusted
colleagues.

You may not know a lot about healthcare now, but you know that it's badly
broken; that it's some insane percentage of our GDP and growing rapidly;
and that it's a problem that you can get passionate about.

About athenahealth-- we've been around for about 7 years now, and are
located in Waltham, MA (just outside Boston). We've been backed with $40
million in venture capital from A-list VC's-- VCs who provided some of the
original money behind Apple, Home Depot, Intel, Office Depot, Whole Foods,
etc-- but the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise
any more capital.

Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to you. The working
environment is friendly and open. The folks you'll be working with are top
notch, and will probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've
ever worked with regardless of where you're coming from-- Harvard/MIT/CMU
grads, former professors, and just plain smart people who took the road
less traveled.

In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of DHTML, CSS, and
JavaScript thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we
believe any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of
a couple of months or so. We're more interested in folks with raw talent
and a burning desire to succeed.
