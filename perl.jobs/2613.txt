Job title:
Intermediate Perl/OO/mod_perl/PostgreSQL Position

Company name: Phase N Australia

Location: Australia, NSW, Sydney

Pay rate:
Neg. $AU50-60k'ish (trial) $60-80k+ (after)

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Indefinite (3 month trial)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Phase N is currently involved in a joint venture to produce a new
(Australian) national product for the motor industry (specifically
dealers), which will run from one central data centre and be accessed
online.

We require one competant/intermediate Perl programmer to start immediately
and help move the product to it's first release in 1-2 months, and then
contribute to improving the product on its monthly release cycle.

Location must be in Sydney but may be flexible for the first month,
depending on the situation. i.e. You may be hosted by a joint venture
partner, or potentially even at home. If willing to move, you will probably
need to do so immediately, and would have to (of course) be legal.

Given the quick start, we will probably need to validate your capabilities
quickly, so a CPAN id or sample code is a strong plus.

Required skills:
Perl, with strong OO
Linux/Apache/mod_perl
PostgreSQL
Template Toolkit
Experienced with a wide range of CPAN modules
HTML and basic JavaScript

Desired skills:
mod_perl2
Oracle
XUL/Firefox Applications
Advanced-JavaScript/DHTML/AJaX
