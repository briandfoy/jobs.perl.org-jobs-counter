language. It needs to be small, fast, reliable.

Eatoni has been working for almost 6 years to make such technology
available. We've developed a good customer base and are profitable.

We are looking for a "Scotty" type person to run and extend our
core integration software. You will deal directly with customers
to deliver software built to their specifications. You will also

reliability, security, and efficiency of our text entry methods.
We are constantly making improvements and expanding our linguistic
repertoire.

This is a dream job for people who

*care about the mobile internet
*care about linguistics
*think clean and powerful code is beautiful
*like New York City
*thrive in a small-company environment
