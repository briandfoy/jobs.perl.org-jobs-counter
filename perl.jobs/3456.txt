Job title:
Perl Developer Web Site and User Interface

Company name: Diamond Financial Products

Location: United States, MI, Southfield

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking to compliment our IT group with an intelligent, highly
capable Perl programmer with an emphasis on User Interfaces and SQL
Database interactions.

This position requires a demonstrated previous experience with Perl running
on Linux (Gentoo) tightly integrated with both MySQL and SQL Server.  Being
a part of the team, you will also be exposed to SOAP, ASP, AGI, Asterisk,
JavaScript, HTML, VB and/or C so any experience in any of these
technologies is a bonus.

This is not simply a “coding position” where you get locked in a cube for 8
hours a day with your fingers on the keyboard while other team members feed
you requirements.  We have a small team so this position dictates that you
have requirements gathering skills, design skills, coding skills and
testing skills.  When a project is given to you, you will be responsible
for its successful completion.	Because of this, people skills and design
skills will be regarded as very important in addition to your demonstrated
technical skills.

This is an exciting position in a small but growing MasterCard Marketing
Company.  You must possess the desire to work in a fast-paced team
environment and have the desire and flexibility to learn new technologies. 
You must be able to work independently with little supervision and meet
target deadlines.  You must have the initiative to ask the questions that
need to be asked instead of waiting for someone to come to you to see how
you are doing.


Required skills:
Primary Duties and Skills:
* Gather requirements, design, develop, and test new
applications/interfaces written in Perl/SQL for in-house projects and
customer support
* Gather requirements, design, develop, and test new
applications/interfaces written in Perl/SQL for client-based projects
* Maintain and modify existing applications/interfaces written primarily in
Perl/SQL


Desired skills:
Secondary Skills (Bonus Qualifications):
* SOAP, ASP, AGI, Asterisk, VB, JavaScript, and C
* General system administration skills for Gentoo Linux
* PC support skills for Windows 2000 and Windows XP
