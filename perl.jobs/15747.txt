Job title: Front End Software Engineer

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for a talented, experienced, and
highly motivated Front End Software Engineer to help us develop and improve
our products and websites. Founded in 2002, MaxMind is an industry-leading
provider of IP intelligence and online fraud detection tools. MaxMind is
privately held and based in Waltham, Massachusetts.

E-commerce fraud
detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is never done.
Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection, which means
we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud detection
service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP products, which
associate geographical and other data with individual IP addresses. We
screen more than a billion online transactions each year and provide IP
intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

The Position
As a
front end software engineer, you will be responsible developing websites
and applications. This includes creating new web applications to help our
clients better detect fraud while also working to improve our existing
applications and websites. You will work closely with other front end
engineers, back end devs, and our product team to convert designs to usable
markup and with our platform development team to produce complex,
interactive, database-driven web applications.

The salary range for this
position starts at $110k/year and is negotiable depending on experience.

We invite candidates from Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North
Carolina, Oregon, and Canada. Relocation to any of the above mentioned
locations is welcome.

Our Development Practices
Our front end code uses
Less, Sass, BEM, Bootstrap, Jade, Gulp, Knockout, and AngularJS; our JS
unit tests are written using Jasmine. Our backend code is largely written
in Perl and Go using PostgreSQL and Linux.  We maintain high standards for
our development practices. All new code is expected to include automated
tests run by TeamCity, and all work goes through internal code review on
GitHub Enterprise.

Working at MaxMind
As an employee of MaxMind, you'll
enjoy the flexibility and autonomy that come with being a member of a small
technical team. Our engineering team is mostly remote, and communicates
frequently via Slack and Google Hangouts. You have the option of working
from our Waltham, MA office.

We're a casual, friendly, results-focused
company of about 35 employees. We want you to get things done, but it's
also important to have a life outside the office.

In addition to
competitive compensation, we offer excellent medical, dental, vision, life,
and short and long term disability insurance, a Safe Harbor 401(k) with
employer contribution, FSA/DCA, and transit reimbursement. Inquire about
benefits for Canadian employees.

Our office is located near downtown
Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, a five minute walk from the nearest
commuter rail line and several express bus lines.
