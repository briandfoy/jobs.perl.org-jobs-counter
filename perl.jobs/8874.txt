Job title: Web Application Developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C25

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys for a variety of
clients in the market research industry. We offer both software licensing
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we program surveys
using our own software on a project-by-project basis for clients who would
rather outsource all survey set up.

We are currently adding major new features to our leading-edge software to
allow us to stay ahead of the competition. Our new hire(s) will have the
opportunity to play a significant role in the design and development of
these new features. The programming will be done using database-backed and
object-oriented programming, with tools such as Perl on the server and
using JavaScript (with the YUI library and Ajax) for the front-end.

Depending on your background and experience, you may also be responsible
for helping to monitor and manage our servers, and for occasionally
providing technical support to our clients.

Required skills:
Our core software is built using Perl, mod_perl, DBI, and Apache running on
Linux servers, with Javascript modules to provide dynamic scripting and web
2.0 technologies on front-end. So our ideal candidate will be experienced
in these tools. More important, however, is a good foundation in overall
programming skills, and the ability to learn and apply new skills quickly.
Furthermore, because the position will involve significant design work and
because new features evolve quickly, we need someone who can take the
initiative to figure out what needs to be done, and then make it happen.

Desired skills:
The following additional skills are desirable:

- Ability to set up hardware (for example, installing all necessary
software on a new Linux server) and some level of networking expertise.
- The ability to understand our business and suggest ways to leverage our
current technology.

Finally, because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked
to wear different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to
help the company grow and prosper.
