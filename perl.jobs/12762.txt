Job title: Software Engineer for Web Application Development

Location: St Louis, MO, USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The St. Louis based leader in breath alcohol detection is looking for a
talented developer to join a small team charged with building the next
generation of web-based tools to help lower incidents related to
intoxication. This team is currently focused on developing and supporting
an application used to lower drunk driving recidivism, and will continue to
grow with opportunities to build new related data management systems.

Since we are building web applications, a solid understanding of HTTP,
REST, and the surrounding concepts are a plus. Additionally, while not all
of the code we've adopted has been written using test-driven / test-first
development, we are adopting it moving forward.

We are currently re-architecting portions of the system and need a person
who can learn new languages and systems and contribute to discussions and
plans to that end. Because several of the technologies we are currently
using are under review, pre-existing knowledge of them all is of lesser
importance than being able to learn and grow with the team and the
requirements. However, this is a short list of some of what we are using:
	• Perl
	• Catalyst
	• Moose
	• Oracle Database Server 
	• Git
	• JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5
	• jQuery, jQueryUI
	• DBIx::Class for our ORM
	• RedHat Enterprise Linux

In the future the REST API we design will be used by embedded systems as
well as consumer mobile devices. Experience or interest working with this
is a plus.

Required skills:
Experience with:
	• a healthy interest in learning and exploring new technologies
	• Perl (and modern web development components, e.g. Catalyst or
Dancer (though we use Catalyst), Moose DBIC)
	• JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5

Desired skills:
Experience with:
	• Git
	• PL/SQL for Oracle DB 11g
	• jQuery, jQueryUI
	• modern deployment strategies
