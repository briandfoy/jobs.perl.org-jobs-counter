Description:
Our business is one of the UK's most respected e-commerce businesses. The
technology platform behind this business offers rewarding and challenging
roles for good Perl developers. We are actively recruiting several Perl
developers to help us add new features and build more capabilities as the
business goes from strength to strength. 

We physically handle more shipments per week (1m+) than any other
e-commerce business in the UK, including Amazon; we have best-in-breed CRM
solutions that are custom built for our unique business model; our website
is one of the biggest in the UK; and our real-time algorithms must process
data often numbering hundreds of millions of records. Almost all our
applications are built in-house and match or exceed in quality and
performance commercially available tools often costing millions of pounds.
We are backed by the investors behind such famous internet names as Skype,
Last.FM, MySQL and Betfair, and we benchmark ourselves against companies
like Amazon.com and Facebook. 

You will consider yourself a born problem-solver, will enjoy a flexible
working environment and a strong team culture, and will find highly
intelligent people very stimulating. You will be working on a high load,
enterprise level Linux / Apache / MySQL / Perl platform and will need good
communication skills as well as technical ability. We value both highly
structured architects as well as a more 'hands on' approach.
