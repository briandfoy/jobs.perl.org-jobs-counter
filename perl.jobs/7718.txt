Hours: Full time

Description:
You maintain existing complex Perl based web applications and work on new
enhancements for these applications. You develop these extensions together
with our customers and our project leaders.

The existing applications are built of several technologies over the last
years ranging from raw DBI based solutions with own CGI and mod_perl
frameworks up to modern Catalyst, Mason and DBIx::Class based solutions.
Practically all new to develop functionalities apply to those more modern
technologies.

You will also design and implement new complex web applications.


Required skills:
You should have profound knowledge of web programming with Perl. We use a
lot of modules from CPAN, so finding, installing, understanding and using
foreign modules is essential.

You are communicative and friendly and you have fun of working in teams.

Desired skills:
You have experiences developing and deploying software under Linux and
maybe know other Unix like operating systems. You have knowledge about SQL,
Oracle, Apache, mod_perl and have experinces with several other aspects
like LDAP, XML/XSLT, webservices, object oriented programming and even
other programming languages.
