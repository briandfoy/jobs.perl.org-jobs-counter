Job title:
Perl Developers required for broad range of app development

Company name: ITERU

Location: Singapore, Singapore

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You will be working on a wide range of projects and products, ranging from
interactive TV applications to IVR and mobile messaging solutions, as well
as a assortment of web technologies. A lot of the work will be prototypical
in nature, but some will require you to develop entire solutions, either as
a team or on your own. Ability to work unsupervised is a strong
requirement, as is the ability to meet deadlines.

Required skills:
Experience with Perl is required, as is an understanding of relational
database structures. 
Formal education will be considered, but is not a prerequisite. The same
goes for previous work experience - the most important thing required is
that you know you can do the work, you can learn what you don't know fast,
and you can show results.

Desired skills:
Exposure to C/C++, Java, Javascript, VB and/or PL/SQL is a plus.
Understanding of technologies such as Unicode, SMTP, HTTP, SSL, SMS, WAP,
IVR, EJB and MHP will also be a benefit, but are not requirements.
Familiarity with Linux, FreeBSD or other multiuser operating systems is a
big bonus.
