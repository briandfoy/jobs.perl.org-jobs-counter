Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Quantitative Finance Group at Bank of America is looking for a C++/Perl
developer to hire as a Quantitative Financial Analyst in Atlanta, GA. This
position will report to a Senior Developer and will be responsible for
assisting in the design and improvement of the group's mortgage related
models and data processes. No knowledge of finance is necessary, but there
will be many opportunities to learn.

Our group manages a $2 billion dollar portfolio, and we provide analytical
support to other groups in the bank. We are a Linux shop, using pvm for
parallel computing on large state-of-the-art clusters. We write all our own
code using predominantly Perl and C++. We run a nightly production system
and respond to a variety of short-term requests.


Required skills:
-   Strong programming skills in C++ (75%) and Perl (25%) - Note we are
interested in command-line Perl, not web development. 
-   Unix or Linux experience
-   Ability to work in a time sensitive, market driven environment
-   Strong attention to detail


Desired skills:
-  Familiarity with source-code control using SVN or RCS
-  Experience with parallel computing using PVM or MPI
-  Experience with boost or TR1
-  Coursework or experience in financial theory, economics, statistics,
derivatives pricing, or stochastic calculus
