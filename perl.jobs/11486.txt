Perl Development – Agile/SCRUM – Extreme Programming – TDD

We’re a team that already has plans for the next step in your career before
you even reach new hire orientation. We're committed to achieving proper
test coverage through test-driven development. We encourage pair
programming so whether you’re a senior or junior Perl Jedi, you have an
opportunity to be challenged as a mentor or mentee. Most of all, we’re
doing this in a SCRUM environment where almost everything we touch goes
into production and has a direct impact on how ValueClick has become one of
the top, most profitable companies in the space.


Required skills:
We're not concerned about how long you've been an engineer or working with
a specific technology stack. Instead, we're focused on how quickly and
independently you've proven to design and develop solutions when given the
problem. We're pretty language agnostic and if you're a polyglot, you'll be
in good company. We do, however need you to be interested and able to work
with:
• Perl, mod_perl, moose
• Linux including Apache web server
• Databases such as Oracle or MySql
• Distributed database computing with an emphasis in Java
• HTML5, Ajax and similar technologies
• Agile development process (2 week sprints, daily standups, software that
actually works and is released while it's still relevant)
