Location: United States, NJ, Atlantic City

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 project 1-2 months

Hours: Flexible

Description:
We are looking for someone to design and develop a small customized website
search engine. Instead of relying only on the SE ranking algorithms, we
want to be able to let a human influence the ranking based on his firsthand
knowledge of the site.	To save time we have considered using one of the
available open source search engines as a base.  

So far I have looked at 
http://www.aspseek.org/   
   example http://www.aspseek.com/   
http://nutch.org
   example  http://www.mozdex.com
http://openfts.sourceforge.net/ 

but all will need a good deal of tweaking.


Required skills:
perl, DBI, mod_perl, process optimization

Desired skills:
perl, DBI, mod_perl, process optimization, postgresql knowledge
