Job title: Perl / MySQL Directory for Developers

Company name: Nick Temple

Internal ID: developersrolodex

Location: United States, Kentucky, Louisville

Pay rate: Looking for bids

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Project

Onsite: no

Description:
I need help developing a database of developers at DevelopersRolodex.com. 
The current system was thrown together in a few hours using PHP to start
collecing data.

Tasks:
1) Architect database to hold current collected information - and help
define what other data may be required, too.

2) Convert current PHP form to Perl/DBI, start storing data in database
(Data validation is needed, too)

3) Take current data from serialized PHP file and store in MySQL database

4) Architect and develop search engine for the developers data (MySQL
Fulltext?).  Premium members should float to the top of the listings and be
bold (or otherwise stand out),and a drill down page for the complete
information.

6) Pages should be SE friendly, using PATH_INFO instead of 
the query string for drill-down links. I'd like to give each member a
linkable page something like:
http://www.developersrolodex.com/profiles/USERNAME.html

7) I need a place where developers can login to modify their profiles.

Evenutally I'd like to convert this to a searchable RSS feed, too - but
that can be phase II.


Required skills:
Perl / MySQL /DBI, Some PHP to convert current serialized data to database,
some sort of Perl templating engine (your choice), basic HTML.

Desired skills:
vi, ssh, familiar with CPanel and autoresponders in general, website design
capability nice but not mandatory (we can use a pruchased template)
