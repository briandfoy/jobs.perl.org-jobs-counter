Award winning, innovative mobile communications services company is
currently looking for an experienced software architect to help re-scale

Using your passion to create robust, quality systems you will need to
evaluate the current design, investigate areas of enhancements, address any
hotspots in terms of complexity and correctness, potential scalability
problems, memory usage and more. The system uses a diverse range of
technologies many of them open source. These include Perl, PostgreSql, C,
Asterisk, Apache, PHP and SMPP. You will need to be experienced in most of
these and be happy to learn the rest. You will report to the Development
Director and work closely with the rest of the development team, especially
the Speech Engineer who leads the speech recognition component of the
system. This is not a managerial role but more of a technical lead, is
looking to pay around 60K and is based in Maidenhead.
