Job title:
Senior OO Perl Developers - NYC - Linux/Unix - commercial s/w dev

Company name: GridApp Systems

Location: United States, NY, New York City

Pay rate: 60-100+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Heavy backend object-oriented Perl development environment in Linux/Unix
(many flavors). Client side is PHP, Perl, JavaScript, etc. Lots of
open-source.

Oldest version of Perl supported is 5.8.7 (although we might migrate to
5.10 on all supported platforms once it is burned in). 

As Open Source fans, we’ve incorporated many CPAN modules:

As far as coding conventions, we use PBP and peer review (use strict; and
use warnings; are mandatory). Warnings are fatal (causing a die to occur).
All code must compile on all supported platforms prior to commit (Linux,
Solaris, Win32, HP-UX, etc.).

Required skills:
* Significantly skilled with Perl (C++, PHP receive bonus points)
* Solid experience in TCP/IP network and/or distributed systems programming

* Working with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL
* Fluency in Linux (flavors of UNIX receive bonus points)

Desired skills:
Simply, an unbridled love of Perl.
