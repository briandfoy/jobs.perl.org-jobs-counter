Job title: Image capture small job

Company name: Silver Fox Design

Pay rate: bid

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am looking for a developer who can write some scripts. We have about 5
hours of work a week that we need a perl developer. Im looking for a
freelancer who is interested in doing project based jobs on a regular
basis. Currently we need a script that does screen captures of URLs and
date and time stamps them and exports them in one of three sizes. Here are
the scripts steps:

1. import a url from an import csv file

2. Go to the URL and screen capture an image of the url, printing onto the
bottom of the image the following information:
A. url
B. The date and time stamp.

3. export the image in one of the following 3 sizes depending on the
argument passed to the script when it was called. For example:
A: capture.pl 1 tells the script to output a screen shot that is 300x300
pixels. 
B. capture.pl 2 tells the script to output a screen shot that is 500X500
pixels.
C: capture.pl 3 tells the script to output a screen shot that is 900X800
pixels.


Please respond with your experience and hourly rate as well as what you
would charge to do the image capture script above. 
Thanks
