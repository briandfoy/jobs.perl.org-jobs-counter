Description:
ew York Magazine is seeking a Software Engineer. The engineer will be
jumping into a busy and quickly maturing development team in need of an
experienced and collaborative addition. This is a challenging position
requiring not only in-depth knowledge of LAMP technologies, but a grasp of
how to create, communicate about, and execute on development projects. The
engineer needs to be comfortable working in a fluid environment, handling a
variety of assignments and technologies. We have a very sharp, passionate,
and fast-moving development team that prides itself on technical excellence
and innovation. People who are used to staid corporate environments or a
heads-down focus on one thing will not be happy here; people who thrive on
learning new technologies, defining their jobs, and having a direct
contribution to the success of the business will do well.

Overall responsibilities:
• Work with business stakeholders and other development team members on
web-based software projects.
• Properly communicate the ongoing status of your projects, both vebally
and in written form
• Help create accurate estimates for your projects.

Required skills:
• 4-6 years experience in web application software development, with
exposure to the full development lifecycle required.
• Proficiency in object-oriented Perl and mod_Perl environment. Specific
expertise in object-oriented Perl and mod_perl compliant application
development strongly desired. Python experience a strong plus.
• High proficiency in JavaScript, with experience in object-oriented
JavaScript development.
• Active working knowledge of AJAX.
• Experience with Perl development frameworks.
• Development experience with the MySQL platform (v.4.1 and v.5). Exposure
to database clustering a plus.
• Ability to work independently with no hand-holding.
• Ability to work in a rapidly changing environment and exhibit grace under
pressure.
• Experience with the entire software lifecycle – analysis, design,
implementation, quality assurance, deployment, and maintenance.
• Strong organizational, problem-solving and communications skills (must be
able to do basic technical writing).
