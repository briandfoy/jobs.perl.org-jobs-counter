Description:
Working for an Industry leading software company providing cutting edge
recruitment software the successful candidate will be an experienced and
highly motivated individual capable of working both independently and
within a larger development team.

Reporting to the Development team manager and, ultimately, to senior

non-technical clients and colleagues and would be proactive in suggesting
improvements in methodology and general team practice.

A keen, technically enquiring mind and an ability to pick up and understand
a variety of 
complex technical processes quickly are key requisites as is the ability to
self organise 
and deal with multiple ongoing issues.

This is a permanent position working as part of the technical team whose
office is based in Edinburgh.

Applicants would ideally be based in the Central Belt in Scotland but
telecommuting is an option for the right candidate.
