Job title: Software Architecture Consultant

Company name: University of San Diego

Location: United States, CA, San Diego

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
University of San Diego's ITS - EAS department is looking for a consultant
with a background in software development/engineering who can help us
design the architecture for our next generation of applications and who
also likes to get hands-on with technology.

To help us choose an architecture, this consultant will work with USD's
in-house staff on an internally developed system which needs its
architecture improved. 


Required skills:
Relevant skills will include:

- Solid understanding of web technology; you must understand what HTML 5
is, why CSS is important, how to write JavaScript, and understand
JavaScript frameworks like jQuery or Dojo.

- Understanding of how to integrate different systems: CSV files (and
better alternatives); RESTful web services; not-so-RESTful web services

- Experience implementing server-side application frameworks; PHP, Ruby on
Rails, J2EE, mod_perl, etc. would all be relevant. We aren't looking for a
specific framework, but rather want someone who understands the concepts
behind various frameworks and can pick up new frameworks quickly.

- Experience in software development in a language such as C, assembler,
Perl, PHP, Java, Ruby, etc. The specific languages are less important than
an understanding of programming and the ability to pick up new languages.

- Experience with some database. It can be MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or
even a non-relational database like CouchDB. You need to understand
concepts of data modelling.

Desired skills:
These things would be a plus, but don't worry if you don't know them.
Problem-solving skills and the ability to learn a new system are more
important to us.
- SunGard Banner
- SunGard Luminis
- Oracle PL/SQL
- EMC Documentum ApplicationXtender
- Server-side JavaScript (Aptana Jaxer, CouchDB, or anything similar)
- Linux (or Unix) server administration
