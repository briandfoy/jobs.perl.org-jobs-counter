Job title: Director of Technology

Company name: WaveMetrix

Location:
United States, California, San Diego, Los Angeles

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are searching for a Director of Technology: a key member of our
technical staff who reports directly to our CTO. This is an ideal position
for someone who wants to play a key role in a growing company. Some of your
key responsibilities will include:

Designing software solutions to vertical search problems, including
large-scale (yet specialized) crawling, meta-data extraction, indexing, and
information retrieval. You will also develop new ways of organizing and
presenting data to consumers and business customers.

You will manage and guide developers as they work through the solutions
you've outlined for them). You will be heavily involved in testing,
integration, and deployment of our code. You will likely write code
yourself, either to build something new or to mod existing software.

In short, you need to know how everything works. 

We are a young company and embrace modern ways of working. We're virtual,
so all our employees get to work from home. We live on Skype. To foster
inter-personal relationships, we meet several times a year in Europe and
the US. We've found this makes us happier, attracts talent from around the
world, and lowers costs. 

Best of all, our business is doing well. We have a fantastic customer list
and are profitable.

Required skills:
· The two most useful languages to know are Perl and Java (in that order).
You should have experience with object oriented Perl. 
· Experience designing and building software solutions for large scale
problems (i.e., practical experience with distributed processing)
· Familiarity with modern web development technologies, including Catalyst,
JavaScript and associated toolkits, widgets, etc.
· Familiarity with databases (especially MySQL) and ORMs such as Class::DBI
and/or DBIx.
· Apache, Tomcat, and Java experience is desired. You should be productive
and comfortable working with open source tools in a Linux environment (we
use open source software extensively and periodically release code back to
the community). 
· You should be capable of deploying and managing software in high
availability production environments. 

A lot of our work is outsourced — which lets us leverage experts even if we
don't have full-time work for them — so you must have experience:
· Managing developers in other countries and time zones
· Planning and tracking towards short-term and long-term goals,
· Writing software development specifications, 
· Performing white box acceptance testing of their deliverables

Desired skills:
· Previous search engine experience (crawling, indexing, relevance
algorithms, etc.) is not required, but helps immensely.
