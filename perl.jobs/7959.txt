Job title:
Perl developer (web & back-end experience)

Company name: SingleFeed

Internal ID: perldev

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
SF Startup seeking experienced Perl developer

SingleFeed is seeking a developer with strong previous experience
developing web and/or other applications in Perl. Come join our small but
growing team of developers and help improve and grow SingleFeed's system as
a major contributor. You'll be creating new solutions, participating in
reviews and system design, and, yes, fixing issues that may need fixing.
Our system is in Perl and the work includes web interfaces, AJAX, text and
data management and manipulation, MySQL database, and data transmission.

SingleFeed is a web service which enables merchants to effectively market
their goods through shopping search engines such as Google Product Search,
Yahoo! Shopping, Shopzilla, and PriceGrabber by managing and submitting
high quality product data feeds. Each shopping engine has a different
specification for how they want product data feeds to be delivered. Each
shopping engine also has a different algorithm for how they rank products.
SingleFeed’s goal is to get merchants up and running quickly and easily on
multiple shopping engines while helping merchants achieve the highest ROI
possible.

SingleFeed is a venture-backed start up with real customers and real
revenue. Our office is located in San Francisco.


Required skills:
- Experience developing significant software for at least 5 years, and you
know about design patterns and anti-patterns; common algorithms; web
application system architecture; good development practices.
- Several years, at least, spent coding substantial applications in Perl.
You know all about Perl subroutines and objects, how the perl threading
model behaves, how to debug and profile apps, and how to make code
efficient yet readable and maintainable.
- You've spent a lot of time with CPAN and know a lot of the best packages
so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
- You're perfectly at home in a Linux environment, and you might even have
reasonable experience as a sysadmin.
- Experience working with SQL databases such as MySQL. You can do
multi-table joins in your head and know the difference between inner and
outer joins.
- Experience with DHTML, CSS, Javascript, and AJAX for web front-end
development.


Desired skills:
- Experience in other languages. Strong PHP experience would be a big plus.

- Good systems understanding, including highly-scalable web applications,
how to cluster Apache and/or MySQL servers, etc.
- Your previous team members know that you can take a project and it'll be
done when you said it would be. And not only that but you've tested it
inside and out already. The QA team really likes you.
- You believe strongly in unit testing, good documentation, code reviews,
and working closely with other developers, who like working with you for
those reasons.
- You've worked at startups before, and look forward to working at another
one even though things can be chaotic at times.
