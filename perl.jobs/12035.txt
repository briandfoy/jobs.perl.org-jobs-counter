Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: DEVNET, Inc.

Location: Sycamore, IL, USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is your chance to be a part of an exciting and growing team that
drives this dynamic company to greater success. DEVNET, Inc. is an
established, privately held company, headquartered in Sycamore, IL. We are
seeking an enthusiastic, disciplined self-starter to help develop the next
generation of web applications for local government at our Sycamore
location.

We’re not hung up on degrees or titles – we’re interested in finding the
right fit for our team.  Hobbyists with elite skills, doctoral candidates,
and experienced engineers all get an equal shake here.	Sense of humor is a
must!

The ideal candidate will possess excellent software and database design
skills.  They must be able to communicate effectively in the English
language, as our developers often work directly with clients.  Candidate
must have excellent analytical and programming skills, and be able to
demonstrate your ability to produce quality, well-documented, and
well-tested code.  Applicants must be motivated, self-starting individuals
that don’t require micro-management to be productive.  While our developers
are rock stars, we have no room for lone gunmen – candidates must be able
to work productively with a team of developers.  The ability to prioritize
and multi-task is vital.

DEVNET offers a casual working environment and competitive compensation
package, including medical, dental, vacation, personal and sick time off. 
We have families too, and offer a family friendly environment.

You must be legally able to work in the United States to apply for this
position.  Individual applicants only. No agencies please.

Required skills:
* Modern Perl programming experience (or expertise with other dynamic
languages and an interest in Perl) 
* Clear understanding of general web application security concerns
including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection
* Strong skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Excellent SQL skills (any flavor, but MS SQL experience a plus)
* Skilled in modern version control usage and concepts (Subversion, git,
Mercurial, etc.)

Desired skills:
Extra Credit for:
* Mac OS X and/or *nix experience
* iOS development experience
* jQuery and jQuery-UI development experience
* Automated testing experience (xUnit, etc.)
* Web Services (SOAP, XML-RPC, REST, etc.)
* MongoDB or other NoSQL database, and the wisdom as to when to use a NoSQL
database
* Elite Aerobie skills
