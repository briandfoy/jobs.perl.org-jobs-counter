Join a highly-motivated Tech Team which produces and maintains the nation's

Our 150,000 members depend on NumbersUSA to make their voices heard in
Congress.

We are eight years old, growing, and financially stable.

If you are in strong agreement with our policy agenda of changing U.S. law
to REDUCE legal immigration to traditional levels and to ELIMINATE illegal

work habits and attitudes, read on!

Important Note: NumbersUSA is PRO-immigrant, but ANTI-mass-immigration. We
take a moderate, charitable tone. Our cause is very mainstream, and our
organization is nationally respected.

We need a skilled mod_perl programmer with strong DBI/MySQL skills to help
us build and maintain our large web applications, which focus on helping
average Americans contact and influence their government on the subject of
reducing immigration (our web site gives full details of our political
position). 

You will be working with a highly motivated, fun group of 9 programmers and
technical support people. You will be working in our office in Arlington,
Virginia, immediately across the river from Washington. We have a bunch of
really interesting Redhat Enterprise servers and maintain numerous
data-intensive web sites. In the world of politics and technology, we are
cutting edge.

The job involves building entire modules of new web functionality, plus
repairing and maintaining existing modules. The challenges are
never-ending, because we are doing many things no one has ever tried
before. We are looking for a focused, hard-working, and inventive employee
to help us reduce our enormous backlog of code projects. You must be
meticulous as to detail and a self-starter.

This position has attractive benefits:

* Starts with two weeks vacation plus one week sick leave!

* All taxes withheld.

* Located only one short block from Metro (subway).

Things you will be doing

Internet political activism toolset (see our site, www.NumbersUSA.com);

2. Working closely with the Director of Technology and your Tech Team
colleagues to develop ideas and solve problems;

3. Getting assigned "bugs" in system, using Bugzilla, and hunting down and
slaying them;

4. Building and maintaining reports;

5. Knocking out lots and lots of good, tight code.

Required skills:
*  Strong Knowledge of Perl both in the mod_perl setting and otherwise

* Familarity with MySQL, sql query writing, setting up and maintaining
relational databases

* Excellent English communication skills (written and oral)

* Legal permission to work in U.S.

 * Strong Knowledge of working on the command line (Red Hat Enterprise
especially)
