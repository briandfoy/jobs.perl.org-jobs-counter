Description:
Have you ever wanted to make a big impact?

Chaffee Interactive, a leading web development firm, 
seeks a top-notch web developer to aid us in building 
web sites and web-based applications. Work from 
home or from our office in Chicago if you prefer.

We are a small company with big clients and are

other companies - yet we are simultaneously engaged

downtown Chicago office, or in the middle of a forest 
with wireless access - then you might be the person 
we are looking for!

You must be committed to customer service and 
excellence.  

Personally, we expect you to have excellent 
communication skills, be easygoing, honest, extremely 
aggressive, and self-motivated. Intellectual curiosity 
is a must, as is a strong desire to expand 
and cultivate your skill sets, both technical and non-technical.

Salary is commensurate with experience.  We offer 
outstanding benefits and have a terrific work 
environment. 


Required skills:
* Minimum 2-4 years experience in web development
* Perl, UNIX, SQL a must
* Relational Databases -  MySQL
* Provide creative solutions with the determination to 
meet deadlines in a fast-paced environment
