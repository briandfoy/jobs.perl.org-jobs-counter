    4+ years professional experience working with relational databases
(SQL), MySQL a plus in a highly transactional environment.
    General experience with MVC patterns, ORMs, Web Services
(client/servers).
    HTML and CSS skills to create templates for web.
    Experience with (and troubleshooting) Javascript (jQuery specifically)
for DOM manipulation and AJAX interactions.
    Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in an
exacting manner.
    Effectively able to handle multiple priorities and manage time
efficiently to deliver projects of varying size.
    Must have excellent communication skills both written and oral. Active
listening is key as we more successful when we seek to understand othersâ€™
views.

Desired skills:
Experience with Agile software development practices (e.g. Scrum,
Lean/Kanban).
    Experience with Template Toolkit.
    Ability to train/mentor junior developers.
    Experience developing automated functional and performance testing
suites
    Linux knowledge.
    E-commerce experience a plus but not required.
