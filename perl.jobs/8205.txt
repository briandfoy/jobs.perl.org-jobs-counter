Job title: Object Oriented Perl Developer

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
ok( $you->enjoy_problem_solving() );
ok( $you->strive_for_simplicity() );
ok( $you->write_tests_first() );
ok( $you->want_to_enjoy_your_job() );

Do you pass these tests? If so, you should be writing software at Airwave
Wireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of
our
time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback loops
speak
louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings. We
practice
test-driven development and have a comprehensive suite of tests... over
31,000
at last count. We pair program, so you'll learn the system quickly and have
a
great time doing it. We have short release cycles, which means your talents

won't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of day.
Software you
write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a couple of
weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP project in the

industry (six years and counting), so we have gotten quite good at
embracing
XP's advantages while avoiding its pitfalls.
