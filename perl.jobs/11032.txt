Job title: Server side dev for theregister.co.uk (Edinburgh)

Company name: The Register

Location: United Kingdom, Scotland, Edinburgh

Pay rate: Neg. based on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Situation Publishing, owner of The Register and Reg Hardware is looking for
a full time developer/sysadmin to work on server side Perl code & Debian
based servers.

You’ll work in our Edinburgh office doing a combination of development,
on-going maintenance and tasks such as log reporting, server monitoring,
applying software updates and system tuning to ensure the availability and
quality of our online presence.

We favour open source: Debian/Ubuntu, Perl, Apache, MySQL & Postgres. We
rely heavily on Git for process and revision control.

Our Edinburgh tech team is small, focused and has a good degree of
autonomy, so you need to be able to produce great work without a carrot or
stick and be comfortable communicating with the wider business via email,
phone, IM and online tools such as Wikis and Google Docs.

We offer a competitive salary based on your experience; company pension
contribution; and 25 days annual holiday.

Required skills:
- Tenacious eye for detail, good design and “working smarter” pragmatic
solutions.
- Plenty of experience writing Perl (or excellent skills in a similar
language and be happy to bend them to working with Perl).
- Debian/Ubuntu experience & be comfortable with the shell, package
management & day to day sysadmin tasks.
- Good knowledge of Apache, modern software revision control (eg, Git) and
be comfortable using SQL.
- Excellent English & the legal right to work in the UK.


Desired skills:
Our business is on the web, so while HTML, JavaScript, CSS skills are not
required they are desirable and you would be expected to become familiar
with them over time.  Knowledge of Exim and/or server virtualisation would
also be a bonus.
