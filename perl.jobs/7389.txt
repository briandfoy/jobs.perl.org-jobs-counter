Job title: Experienced Perl/Linux/Web Developer

Company name: CampusExplorer.com

Location: United States, CA, Santa Monica

Pay rate: open

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Campus Explorer is looking to add a third developer (or engineer or geek or
whatever you want to be called) to our very small, very experienced team of
startup entrepreneurs.

The existing team members at Campus Explorer have worked closely together
in the past and have played critical roles in a number of early stage
startups including: Rent.com, ThisNext.com, Gifts.com, eToys.com,
FoxSports.com, Stamps.com, Citysearch.com, and Evo.com.

Cool technologies we are currently using include:
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Apache
- MySQL
- Perl
- Catalyst
- Template Toolkit
- mod_perl
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, YUI
- memcached
- MogileFS
- Perlbal
- Puppet
- Munin
- Postfix
- Amazon EC2/S3 (testing)
- and many more...

To hit the ground running, you'll need to be pretty much an expert in Perl,
Linux, SQL, and general web knowledge.	The rest of it a smart person can
pick up quickly as needed, and we'd be happy for you to bring in additional
expertise to complement ours.

Campus Explorer is VC funded and offers salary, equity, and benefits in
addition to the enjoyable working environment, great co-workers, and cool
technology.  If you're looking for casual competence and low-pressure
high-productivity where clean design and simple automation rules, then
let's talk.
