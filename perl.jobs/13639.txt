Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Lokku

Location: Clerkenwell, London

Pay rate: £25,000 - £35,000, dependent on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Lokku is seeking an intelligent, motivated and forward thinking developer
to work on our primary product, the Nestoria property search engine, and to
help us continue serving millions of house hunters in eight countries and
six languages.


The Role:

The challenges we face at Lokku are similar to those faced by larger search
engines such as Google. On the one hand we have a huge amount of data that
we need to analyse, clean up, extract keywords from, geocode and
de-duplicate. On the other hand we have a very popular website that needs
to remain highly stable and lightning fast.

You will be a part of the development team which maintains and improves
these systems. You will not be restricted to any one part of the code base;
you will work on projects which range from backend processing and internal
tools to the interactive website and its heavily customised search-time
code.


The Person:

Maybe you are looking to make the move to a tech team which embraces the
principles of clean code, best practice development methodologies, and
user-centred product planning. Perhaps you crave a role in a smaller,
tightly-knit team which affords you a higher degree of responsibility and a
more diverse range of juicy projects to work on. Or maybe you can't wait to
get your hands on our databases and start mining for new insights that we
can use to help our users.


About Lokku:

Lokku is a small web company based in Clerkenwell, central London. Our
primary brand Nestoria is a vertical search engine in the real estate
market.

We like to give something back to the technology communities we're involved
in, and are especially keen on contributing to the Perl (CPAN) and
Geo-spatial open source development communities. We make our API available
to developers, are frequent sponsors of relevant events and operate
#geomob, a quarterly meet up for geo and mobile enthusiasts.

We also like to give back to our team members. We invest time into
expanding our collective knowledge through attending conferences and
training days, and through our own internal tech talks where each week one
engineer presents to the team about any subject. Each developer in the team
has a training budget allocated them and are expected to search out and
suggest training opportunities.

Required skills:
•	Experience running and developing on UNIX/Linux platforms (we use
Debian)
•	Experience with Perl 5…
•	… or with other scripting languages such as Python or Ruby
•	Experience with SQL-based relational databases
•	Knowledge of the internet and of web development
•	Excellent technical communication skills
•	A pragmatic and practical approach to solving problems
•	Some understanding of Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc),
plus XML, JSON, LAMP stack

Desired skills:
•	Knowledge of modern client-side web technologies
•	Ability to write and maintain C code
•	Experience with internationalization and character encoding
•	Good understanding of test-driven development
•	Understanding of revision control
•	Experience with writing systems which have to scale to large
numbers of users, database rows, etc.
