Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: Shiftboard Inc

Location: Seattle, WA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our small team is about to become a little bigger. Plus one for sure. Plus
two if you bring a friend as awesome and as qualified as you.

When an organization needs to coordinate, schedule, and track 10,000
skilled contract, part-time, seasonal, or volunteer staff, it does not use
Post-Its or pencils, it uses Shiftboard.

Our office is the 30th floor of the iconic Smith Tower in downtown Seattle
offering a 360-degree view of the city, the Puget Sound, Mt Rainier, and
the east sideline of Century Link Field. You can open the window on a warm
day and enjoy the breeze 30 stories above the city. You get to talk to an
actual elevator operator while watching each floor go fly by. We're kitty
corner from Tat's. We have some of the best seats available for 2014-07-31
and 2014-08-01--the practice days for the Blue Angels next year.

In addition to having an awesome product and an amazing location, we have a
great team and you will help make it even better. Our founder and CEO was
the lead developer for many years and understands technology and the work
involved to make magic happen. Our company is still very small enabling you
to make a big impact. We are debt-free and profitable so we're going to be
here for a while. Our turn-over is nearly nonexistent which is why you
rarely hear about us hiring. We are not growing for the sake of growing, we
are growing because we have more work than we can handle; most of which
will help increase revenue. Our existing engineers are top-notch and we're
only interested in hiring the cream of the crop. We believe that talent
breeds talent and we need some top-shelf talent. There is a lot that you
can learn from us. If we do not feel that is reciprocal, you will not be
offered a job.

We are an open source shop. We use mostly Perl and MySQL on Ubuntu. We also
have some Bash, Python/Django, Lisp, Freeswitch, Memcached, Android, iOS,
and FreeBSD. We love Git. More technologies are likely to come in the near
future once we hire additional engineers and can start those projects.

We are not a Java shop. We are not a Microsoft shop. Most of us use very
nice MacBooks. If you like Windows we have an opening on our support team.

If you are a brilliant developer and you like working with other brilliant
developers and you're prepared to absolutely love your job, contact us.

our $email = q(fohjoffsjoh@tijgucpbse.dpn); $email =~ y/b-z/a-y/; say
$email;

Fine print: On-site, full-time, salaried position with standard benefits
and competitive salary.

Required skills: Perl. SQL. Linux.
