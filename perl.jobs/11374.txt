Job title: Jack of all trades for social networking startup

Company name: Public Karma, Inc

Internal ID: init1

Location: United States, GA, Atlanta

Pay rate: project (USD)

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 25 Jun. 2011

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I've been a Perl developer for 15 years (CPAN: RUDY) and am working on a
start up that's looking for a sharp programmer (or few) wanting a crash
course in building big, high-performance websites.  Rather than drop hints,
this is a budget-restricted project, though we will be free and plentiful
with references and potential future work, if it works out.  

The project deadline is fixed 25 Jun. for a working model, and we need
someone to furiously flesh out the web-based portion of a social networking
site.  There should be lots of fun problems and interesting architecture
issues to hash out.  This is not a Windows shop and someone who can work in
a Linux/*BSD environment is a must.  Willing to consider a PHP CMS (Drupal,
Joomla, and friends), if a convincing argument is made for speed of
implementation and scalability.

This is a remote position, so the candidate should be able to work over
instant message and telephone.	Must also be willing to sign a
nondisclosure agreement before receiving specifications, and must be
authorized to work in the US on a 1099 basis (corp-to-corp preferred but
not absolute). 

Required skills:
-understanding of relational databases (preferably
MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
-Perl 
-web development
-basic system administration

Desired skills:
-noSQL databases (Mongo, Cassandra, Memcached, etc.)
-front end (graphic design is not needed)
-JavaScript (jQuery)

Tell us what you've got and what you want to play with and we might be able
to work with it.
