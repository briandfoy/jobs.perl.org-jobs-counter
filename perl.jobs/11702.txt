Job title:
Perl Software Engineer sought to help revolutionize an industry

Company name: Shutterstock

Location: New York City, NY, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Shutterstock loves Perl. We're a stock photo and video company, and we see
ourselves at the forefront of technology and research. We do fascinating
things with search, discovery, recommendation engines, and scalability.
We're looking for great Perl engineers to help us continue to be a leader
in our industry.
 
We're an agile shop, and we focus on close interaction, so you'll have to
be local to the New York area. But if you're awesome enough, we'll move you
out here!

We've got a strong commitment to open source software.
 
If that's not enough, check out these other perks:
 
- All the hardware you want: Our philosophy is that hardware is cheap
compared to your time. If you think it will increase your productivity,
we'll buy it for you.
- Professional development: The more you know, the more valuable you are to
us. So you'll get any tech book you want, and we'll reimburse your tuition
for classes.
- Lots of free goodies: Breakfast, fruit, pizza on Fridays, and even
massages.

We've got a strong commitment to open source software. Check out our team
