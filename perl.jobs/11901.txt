Job title: Senior Perl Programmer

Company name: Cyber Sprocket Labs

Location: Charleston, SC

Pay rate: USD$30-$60k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are seeking a programmer to come on board with Cyber Sprocket to learn
the ropes before transitioning to our new start-up company that we are
launching in 2012.  The new company is a streaming music company that has
received a lot of attention from the investment community

What we need today is a top-notch coder with strong Perl skills to jump
into various projects at Cyber Sprocket, get to know the team, get to know
our systems, and get ready to do something very cool with us when
Musiplicity enters the full R&D phase in the next few months.

Coders that are well rounded and have some database skills (MySQL,
PostgreSQL preferred) and are all-around language gurus (PHP, Python, C#)
will earn top-dollar. If you are just starting out, that works too.  We are
more interested in attitude & aptitude than pedigree.

Cyber Sprocket Labs offers a casual work environment where jeans and polo
shirts are the norm.

We have a great health plan that is offered at a reduced cost and very
flexible paid time off program.  Our senior development team also has a
work-from-home option.

We also have a unique profit sharing plan that has been quite lucrative for
employees that qualified to participate this year.

Perhaps one of the best things we have to offer is true high-tech software
development jobs in one of the most beautiful cities in America. Great
beaches, downtown shopping, and an active night life are all within minutes
of our offices. If relaxing is more your style, you can find the slower
pace of southern neighborhoods just around the corner.

You can learn more about our company and some of our other openings here:

mmer/

Required skills:
Perl, experts wanted but we will take junior-level.

REST, JSON or similar remote request concepts.

Some form of SQL (specific DB flavor not important).

Desired skills:
PHP, C#, or Python would be helpful.

Basic understanding of REST, JSON, and other API-centric design concepts is
useful.

Knowledge of XHTML, and basic JavaScript expected.

We will be doing mobile apps, skills not required for this position but
helpful.  Java for Android, Objective-C for IOS.
