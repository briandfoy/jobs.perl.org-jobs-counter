Job title:
Senior Software Development Engineer / Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com)
Amazon.com

Company name: IMDb.com / Amazon.com

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Senior Software Developer (Seattle)

If you're a top notch programmer and a fan of movies and TV, we've got the
ideal job for you.

There're many good reasons to work at IMDb, and here are three of them:

1. You can make a huge difference at IMDb. We've already developed a
successful business model and a stable production environment, so our
programmers spend their time developing and launching cool projects with
little red tape and lots of autonomy.

2. We offer flexibility both in terms of your day-to-day work schedule and
also in terms of work assignments. Ours is no cookie-cutter job.

3. Our software developers provide lots of creative input into projects and
get to work on many different types of projects that allow them to think
creatively and to handle interesting computer science challenges.

Job Requirements: minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer science with
three plus years of industry programming experience. In particular, we're
looking for applicants who are skilled in Perl and able to develop systems,
not just programs.

In addition, we prefer an applicant with some advanced competency in one or
more areas that can complement our current staff. This can include, but is
not restricted to C++, Javascript, DHTML, statistics, Windows client
development, data modeling, natural language processing or web services.
We'd like to see examples of your skills in these areas - either from a
personal website or from other materials.

Lastly, you must genuinely be self-motivated. Our staff is distributed
across the planet so we need employees who can function independently while
also interacting efficiently with other team members. For our novel work
environment we need programmers who work hard and think big.

More Details: You don't really need to love movies or TV to thrive here,
but it certainly doesn't hurt. We have a great environment of talented
people who work hard to make IMDb the most credible film source on the
planet and we'd like you to join us if you're like-minded.

IMDb is owned by Amazon.com, but we operate separately and have our own
technology systems. When you join IMDb, you become a full-fledged
Amazon.com employee - which means you enjoy the cohesive work environment
of a small company while also gaining the bigger benefits of working for a
Fortune 500 company. It's the best of both worlds.

If you are a capable programmer and this opportunity sounds interesting to
you, we're looking forward to hearing from you!

Applicants only: recruiters must not submit on behalf of other people
through this link. Applications not submitted by candidates themselves are
rejected. 

We're looking forward to hearing from you!

Example questions that you might get asked to solve in an interview or
pre-interview phone call

These questions are deliberately vague or ambiguous - as a software
developer at IMDb you'd need to know how to ask questions to add rigor and
definition to them and then go on to solve them. If these feel
straightforward to you then you're probably a good candidate for us. These
questions are largely language neutral although our primary development
environment is Perl.

# Can you implement Bacon Numbers? What kind of data structures would you
use to implement them efficiently on a small and large database?
# Tags are a lightweight meta-data collection mechanism that can be
leveraged to allow end-users to classify items in an application with their
own vocabulary. What are the basic functions (including parameters) that we
should implement to support tagging? Can you provide a code sample for the
function that "adds tags"? Would what you've built be a good architecture
for implementing MoKA? Why or why not?
# A customer can assert that our website is unresponsive for many reasons.
Name as many of as you can, and a plan of attack to disambiguate one reason
from another.
# What's a good plan of attack for merge-sorting N text files? How about if
the text files are known to be large? (megabytes each)? How about if they
are very large? (gigabytes/terabytes each). How does your plan change if
you don't know the size in advance?

Required skills:
Bachelors Degree, Computer Science
3+ years professional programming experience
moderate to senior level of Perl experience

Desired skills:
Interest in film or television
DHTML
Javascript
Software Design Architectures
