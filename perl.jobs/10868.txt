Job title:
Senior Perl engineers to work on legacy systems to free up staff to work on
new systems.

Company name: Apple Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Cupertino

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6-12 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
My group is looking for 2 senior level contract Perl engineers starting
ASAP in 2011. These are independent contractor positions, not Apple
employees.

The project requires extensive (but not 100%) on-site work in Cupertino,
California. Exact amount on onsite vs. offsite to be determined by team on
a result-oriented basis.

If an individual is not able to get qualified as a vendor or work through
an existing vendor then they can be brought on as an employee of the
staffing company we use.

Length of engagements will start at 6-9 months, with the possibility of
being extended to a total of 12 months.

The work is to assist in the creation of a new Content Management and
Publishing system which must take over from a legacy system
with no interuption in service.  The legacy systems are primarily written
in Perl.

The contractors will:

* Wrap the legacy systems in automated tests to reduce the risk of
  making changes.
* Modify existing systems to enable encapsulation or
  replacement by a new system currently under development by staff.
* Take on most of the day-to-day work on the existing systems, to free
  up staff to work on the new systems.

Required skills:
Must-Have qualities:

* Excellent plays-well-with-others skills. No lone-wolf coders.
* Expert in Object Oriented Perl and Perl technologies such as CPAN,
  various testing modules, etc.
* Proven ability to add automated tests to and safely make changes in
  legacy code.
* Experience with and enthusiasm for agile development.
* Be highly organized, able to analyze competing priorities, and
  help stakeholders make good decisions to resolve priority conflicts.
* Extensive experience on two or more *nix systems (Mac OS X, Linux,
  Solaris, etc.)
* References

Desired skills:
Nice-to-Have skills and experience:
* Active participation in one or more Open Source projects with multiple
  developers.
* Mac OS X
* JavaScript skills, especially Sproutcore
* Cocoa/Objective-C
* SVN
* git
* buildbot
* RESTful web services
* Ruby/Ruby on Rails
* Familiar with and in general agreement with "Perl Best Practices"
