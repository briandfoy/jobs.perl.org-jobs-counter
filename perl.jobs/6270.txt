Description:
Envisionext, Inc. (www.envisionext.com) is a privately-held global
enterprise focused on establishing leadership in the online industries via
the use of its highly qualified staff and the latest technologies.
Envisionext offers a wide spectrum of products and services that include

We are recruiting Perl developers for our new office in the Docklands,

distribution, social networking and search engines.

Interviews will take place over the next 6 weeks by our CTO, a veteran Perl
programmer with many years of experience developing mod_perl based
applications. Candidates are advised against applying for the job unless
Perl development satisfies them at a level beyond anything else. Whilst
experience in other languages is an obvious benefit, we are looking for
someone who knows Perl inside out.

Required skills:
* Excellent Linux/FreeBSD understanding with 5+ years usage experience
* 2+ years development experience with OO Perl
* 2+ years development experience with Perl Template systems and/or MVC

* Working experience with all the current buzzwords, AJAX, SOAP, XML etc


Desired skills:
* University Degree in Computer Science or equivalent subject an advantage

Most importantly, candidates must demonstrate a high level of competency in
maths with a strong logical awareness.
