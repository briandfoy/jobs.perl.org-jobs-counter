Hours: Full time

Description:
On-site full-time position in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

Seeking motivated
Software Engineer with strong experience using front-end frameworks to
develop smooth flowing Web purchasing solutions.  Our back-end is Perl
MySQL Solr Linux Apache Git etc.  Front-end JavaScript jQuery UI HTML5 CSS3
Bootstrap Angular.

We are not expecting you to be a 9 out of 10 of the
Desired Skills listed below, but we use then all, and they should give you
a feel for the environment.  We prefer to use open source solutions when
possible, whatever is best, most efficient.  We have exciting plans and we
are looking for someone that can contribute to the discussion, but also
knows when it is necessary to buckle down and do what needs to be done. 
Knowledge of time-saving rapid-development front-end frameworks, and Perl,
is important.

Applicant should enjoy challenges, be quick to grasp
objectives, see three steps ahead, yet is calm and collected.  Extensive
experience, or right out of school, both work for us, as long as you are
motivated, sharp, and have a track record of completing projects (just
completing your degree is not a track record).

Company is largest 3M
products distributor in US and Mexico, with 50 stocking warehouses.  We
offer our customers the best services in the industry for their factory
floor supplies, allowing customers to purchase by phone, over the counter,
on the web, or automatically through our web-based proprietary Purchasing
and Supply Solutions.

Stable growing company (66 years old), with small
nimble technical team, located in the heart of ski country, and near five
National Parks.  We are a bit laid back, but no, you can't bring your dog
to work, cut your hair in the lunch room, or show up in a T-Shirt.

Four-year degree required, and it can be in French History, if you are a
damn good Software Engineer.  Full benefits, and the chance to work with
some great people.
