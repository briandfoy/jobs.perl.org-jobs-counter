Description:
Are you looking for a rewarding job? With over 2 million visits per month,
we're the UK's leading flat and house share website. We're in the top 10 UK
property sites and the top 750 sites overall for UK traffic.

SpareRoom's staff are a diverse bunch of creative individuals who enjoy
being part of a small team that packs a big punch.

We offer a relaxed and friendly working environment in a light and spacious
office in the centre of Macclesfield, just a couple of minutes walk from

live. If you are creative and hard working, you will see your ideas having
a direct effect on SpareRoom and how it develops.

You'll be responsible for developing and expanding our website's backend
Perl code, automating tests and infrastructure tasks, providing internal
support and fixing bugs. We're big on code quality and encourage
well-tested, maintainable code over rushing to hit deadlines. You'll be

thrives on the chance to work hard, innovate and make a huge difference.

Required skills:
* Perl 5 programming, preferably procedural and OO
