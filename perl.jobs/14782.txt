Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA  USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
As a Senior Software Engineer, your job will be to carry out development
projects both big and small. You may work on data collection improvements
for our fraud system, fix bugs in our open source APIs, or develop an
entirely new service. We're looking for an experienced software developer
who can make good technical design decisions, write tests and
documentation, and communicate well with non-developers.

Our development team is largely comprised of telecommuters, so
communication centers around Google Hangouts, group chat, and agile
planning tools. We invite candidates to apply from the US and Canada.
Full-time telecommuting is permitted.

Our Development Practices
The vast bulk of our code base is written in Perl using PostgreSQL and
Linux, with a bit of C where it's needed. Though Perl will continue to be
our language of choice for new code, we’re also developing new services in
Go when our performance needs demand that we do so. We use free software as
much as possible, and we release code back to the community when this makes
sense. We maintain high standards for our development practices. All new
code is expected to include automated tests, and all work goes through code
review on our internal GitHub system.

Compensation includes a starting salary of $120-150k/year and participation
in a performance-based bonus plan.

Required skills:
•  Dynamic language programming experience. We use Perl but we're happy to
hear from Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby, <insert language here> developers
as well.
•  Web development, especially RESTful web services.
•  Experience developing for deployment on a Linux or BSD platform.
•  Experience writing tests and documentation.
•  Experience doing code reviews.
•  Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
•  The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.

Desired skills:
•	Data mining, number crunching, and math skills.
•  Design for high scalability and distributed processing.
•  Experience writing C code, especially libraries.
•  Experience writing Go code.
•  FS/OSS contributions. Tell us about them!
