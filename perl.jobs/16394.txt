Job title: A New Way to Work. Perl Job in London

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: West London, UK

Pay rate: Inline with experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This ain=E2=80=99t your father=E2=80=99s office

Once upon a time, before dial-up was
invented, people traveled great distances to small offices lit by
unforgiving fluorescent bulbs. They worked long hours and took lunch breaks
at their desks, eating soggy cheese sandwiches and drinking coffee as
bitter as battery acid. At five o=E2=80=99clock, they shuffled home and pre=
pared
themselves to do it all again the next day . . . That was then, and this is
now. Read on to hear about an office for the new millennium!

Our client is
looking for a senior-level Perl programmer who believes in innovation. They
are one of the UK=E2=80=99s leading estate agencies with over 60 branches a=
nd a
spectacular web presence that puts others to shame. Leave behind the
offices of old and get ready for a tiered lake, decked boardwalk, pathways,
events space, and an on-site Virgin Active gym.

No need to go to the ends
of the earth for this one; located in Chiswick Business Park, this gorgeous
office complex is accessible by underground or overground transportation.
Forget schlepping from home to work only to shoehorn yourself into a tiny
cubby; you=E2=80=99ll have no trouble getting to work at your new role, and=
 once
you=E2=80=99re there, enjoy a range of restaurants, pop-up vendors, and str=
eet-food
carts. Seriously, does this even sound like work?

Okay, okay, there is
SOME work to be done, but this company has a mission to hire brilliant
people and provide them with the best, most up-to-date technology, which
means you=E2=80=99ll be at the forefront of their industry. You will be the=
 first
to try new technologies and develop features that make a positive
experience on their end user=E2=80=99s experience.

If you=E2=80=99re on board with doing
things a little differently, send us a letter=E2=80=94just kidding! Email, =
please,
and do it quick, before this plum role is snapped up.
