The ideal candidate is a versatile engineering professional with experience

plus. 
• Experience defining, estimating, and tracking the progress of technical
tasks for a schedule is very important. 
• Proficiency in writing HTML and CSS by hand with strict adherence to W3C
standards is a plus as is experience with JavaScript and Flash. 
• Familiarity with common sysadmin tools (cron, scp, etc.) and CVS or other
source code control systems for collaborative development would be very
useful. 
• Inability to punch a wooden plank with enough force to snap it in half
can be overlooked in an otherwise ideal candidate.
