Location: United States, Arizona, Scottsdale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 to 6 months minimum

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I am not posting as a recruiter or agency.  The compnay I work for is in
need of a few people for a 3 to 6 month (minimum) contract, for the team I
work on.  There is a strong possibility that at least 1 will go to f/t at
the end of the contract. 

The positions involve creating customized functionality to our existing
web-based system, for specific clients.  Environment is Linux, Apache,
mod_perl, MySQL, and the possibility of some development work being done
for a Windows server.  

We need strong Perl coders, with web-based application experience in a team
environment.  Position is based in Phoenix, AZ and candidates must be local
or willing to relocate (we can not pay for relocation costs).  No
telecommuters, unfortunately.

If you are interested, please send a resume and code sample to me at
mbadolato@gmail.com.  You may also contact me with any questions etc.  Code
sample doesn't have to be a full application; just enough to get a feel for
your style, experience, knowledge, etc.

Thanks,
--Mark Badolato
