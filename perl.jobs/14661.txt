Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
MaxMind is looking for a talented, experienced, and highly motivated Senior
Software Engineer to help us develop and improve our products. Founded in
2002, MaxMind is an industry-leading provider of IP intelligence and online
fraud detection tools.	MaxMind is privately held and based in Waltham,
Massachusetts.

Transaction fraud detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is
never done. Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection,
which means we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud
detection service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP
products, which associate geographical and other data with individual IP
addresses. We screen half a billion online transactions each year and
provide IP intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

*The Position*
As a Senior Software Engineer, your job will be to carry out development
projects both big and small. You may work on data collection improvements
for our fraud system, fix bugs in our open source APIs, or develop an
entirely new service. We're looking for an experienced software developer
who can make good technical design decisions, write tests and
documentation, and communicate well with non-developers.

Our development team is largely comprised of telecommuters, so
communication centers around Google Hangouts, group chat, and agile
planning tools. Massachusetts residents may have the option of
telecommuting after a training period.

*Working at MaxMind*
As an employee of MaxMind, you'll enjoy the flexibility and autonomy that
come with being a member of a small technical team. We're a casual,
friendly, results-focused company of about 25 employees. We want you to get
things done, but it's also important to have a life outside the office.

In addition to excellent medical, dental and vision, we offer Life
Insurance, disability, 401k with employer contribution, FSA and transit
reimbursement.	We also have performance bonuses!

Our office is located near downtown Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, a five
minute walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus
lines.

*Our Development Practices*
The vast bulk of our code base is written in Perl using PostgreSQL and
Linux, with a bit of C where it's needed. Though Perl will continue to be
our language of choice for new code, weâ€™re also developing new services in
Go when our performance needs demand that we do so. We use free software as
much as possible, and we release code back to the community when this makes
sense. We maintain high standards for our development practices. All new
code is expected to include automated tests, and all work goes through code
review on our internal GitHub system.

Required skills:
* Dynamic language programming experience. We use Perl but we're happy to
hear from Javascript, PHP, Python, or Ruby developers as well.
* Web development, especially RESTful web services.
* Experience developing for deployment on a Linux or BSD platform.
* Experience writing tests and documentation.
* Experience doing code reviews.
* Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
* The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.

Desired skills:
* Data mining, number crunching, and math skills.
* Experience writing C, especially libraries.
* Experience writing Go.
* FS/OSS contributions. Tell us about them!
