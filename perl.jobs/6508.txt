Job title: Senior Perl Software Developer

Company name: MailChannels Corporation

Location: Canada, BC, Vancouver

Pay rate:
We will pay what it takes to get a great candidate

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for someone who wants to change the world. Simply put,
our mission is to create email protection solutions that are baked
into the fabric of every email delivery platform on the planet. Our
ultra scalable email delivery system processes hundreds of millions of
email messages each day for major corporations worldwide and is
helping to put to rest the "botnet" problem that is currently the
number one issue facing IT managers.

Our product, Traffic Control, is a transparent SMTP proxy, designed to
withstand denial of service attacks and to create a financial friction
for spammers. It provides a shield for the existing spam threat and it
discourages spammers from sending spam email to servers running
Traffic Control.

We need your help improving Traffic Control by developing better
spammer identification algorithms, improving traffic shaping
techniques and providing a better end-user experience.

MailChannels' motto is "do more with less":

 - We have a small team of highly efficient and pragmatic developers
   who wear several hats through the day.

 - We don't write much code. We do write a lot of tests.

 - We don't work extra hours, as we believe that having personal and
   family time is essential for a good quality of life. Though we work
   very hard during the normal working hours.

 - We all read Fred Brooks' "The Mythical Man-Month", and as a result
   we hardly waste any of our time on boring meetings, we brainstorm
   instead.


We'd like to add you, if you are committed to excellence in software
and want to change the world.


Required skills:
- 5+ years of experience as a Perl software developer
- Must have familiarity with CPAN modules
 + What work have you contributed to CPAN?
- Regression test writing and code debugging experience is essential
- Scalable application design and implementation is required
- Good knowledge of Linux is required (other Unixes is a plus)
 + We target Solaris, FreeBSD, and Linux
- gcc compilation and linking knowledge is a plus
- Proven track record of delivering high quality software applications.
- Strong communication skills.
- It's important to be a good team player
- Strong background in systems design concepts
