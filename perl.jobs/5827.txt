Job title: perl developer

Company name: Scoutware

Location: United States, IL, Chicago

Pay rate: TBD

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Scoutware is the leader in recruiting communication solutions for college
athletics.  A young, privately-funded company headquartered in Aurora IL,
we work with more than 700 teams spanning 175 universities - up from just
one in 2003.  In fact, we doubled our client base in 2006 alone.

We are looking for one more big time perler to help us build upon our
success.

Our ideal candidate will have expert knowledge of OO perl in a *NIX
environment and will enjoy working in a challenging, fast-paced
environment.  In other words, you will be counted on to produce and deliver
high-quality code, under pressure.  Significant experience developing and
maintaining large, secure, web-based Perl applications is a must.  

A quick 5 reasons why Scoutware is an oasis for a strong perl coder:

1) The president, CIO, and Director of Technology, whom you'll work with
directly, are all avid perl coders.  Your job will be both understood and
appreciated, and the work you do will make a difference.
2) At every level you'll get to work with pros, not schmoes, in a
supportive, team-oriented environment.	
3) We embrace telecommuting.  You have the freedom to work from home if you
choose.
4) We pay for half of your Blue Cross / Blue Shield health insurance.  Same
for dental and vision coverage.
5) If you are into sports (NOT a requirement), then "Whoa Nelly!" - this is
certainly the place for you.


Required skills:
Specific skills we are looking for include:

* STRONG OO perl capabilities
* significant experience writing code in *NIX environment
* significant experience developing data-driven SQL applications in a CGI
environment
* significant experience designing and implementing efficient data models
within an SQL database
* Working knowledge of web security fundamentals 
* Working knowledge of markup languages, specifically HTML and XML
* STRONG communication skills

Scoutware is a growing company - we currently have 25 employees - and this
position is a rare opening on our development team.  We are looking for a
special person to come in and contribute right away to our impressive,
LAMP-based system.  If you are motivated, creative, resourceful,
personable, and a true professional, then you'll find this to be a
tremendous opportunity we'd love to speak with you about.
