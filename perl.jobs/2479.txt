Job title:
Wanted Volunteer Perl mySQL programmer with a passion for documentary
films.

Company name: e screening room (non-profit)

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: none

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3 months 4 h/wk

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a volunteer with a passion for documentary films and in
support of the freedom of speech, with experience with Perl, some MySQL /
SQL and some experience with cgi would come in handy. We are using agile
programming methods.. We can’t pay you anything but you get to help create
a cool site for your resume and we will mail shade-grown coffee to keep you
going. Expect to volunteer about 4 hour a week. 

The e screening room http://escreeningroom.org/ on-line website
(none-profit) dedicated to the documentary film. Documentary film fans can
watch full length unabridged films. If they like what they see they can buy
a DVD copy for home viewing. We are awaiting non-profit status. The e
screening room is created by volunteer work.

The e screening room is dedicated to create a different distribution
channel for documentary producers. Independent documentaries are born out
of the passion –often compassion - for the subject of the documentary.
Often these documentaries are self financed.  But there is little financial
gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get
discouraged and often leave the field. We think that’s a shame: to lose an
independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we
are changing that by creating a new distribution channel for documentary
film.

The basic engine is running. This is what we are working on now:
1) Reporting the actual time each documentary is watched. (in progress)
2) The on-line submission process. (in progress) 
3) Interaction with other data basis. 
4) Site search
5) Site Status page 
6) 99 cents tickets. 
 
You can see where we are at http://escreeningroom.org. We meet by phone
usually 2 a month. 

To apply send us 
1) Why you are interested in documentary films.
2) At least one link to a website that shows you skills and explain what
part you created. 
3) At least two references. 
4) Your contact info. 

This is a voluntary position, but cool for a cool site.

If this is something you feel as passionate about as we do, please send me
a few lines about your experience to:
