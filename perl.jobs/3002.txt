Description:
Open List, Inc. builds and operates vertical search applications. We're a
committed Perl, mod_perl, open source development team, and are looking for
motivated, talented, take-charge developers to help us extend and evolve
our core platform. Our daily fare is widely varied, and can include:

 - high volume data processing
 - tricky text mining and classification
 - building and managing taxonomies
 - Web crawling at scale
 - mind-bending regular expression work
 - building mod_perl apps and handlers

We're looking for folks who are very strong problem solvers, but who aren't
afraid to also tackle the nitty-gritty of writing good documentation and
tests, and going the distance on the less glamorous tasks.

Search is a great emergent field to ply your skills in, and Open List wants
to provide the right developers with a great opportunity to help build
interesting technology and great consumer products....


Required skills:

 - Strong OO Perl development
 - Can write clear, concise POD
 - Test-oriented approach
 - Rapid prototyping experience
 - Strength in complex data structures, algorithms

Desired skills:

 - Experience with search technology a plus-and-a-half
 - Systems administration skills appreciated
 - mod_perl expertise/experience
