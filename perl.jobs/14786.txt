Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Booking.com

Location: Amsterdam, the Netherlands

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We run one of the world's largest Perl-powered websites. Whether it is
hardening Perl's hash function or developing efficient serialization
libraries, we solve serious problems using Perl. With over half a million
room nights reserved on Booking.com daily, we are seeking Perl developers
driven by challenges of scalability and rapid, customer-focused
development. Our development strategy is agile and based on Scrum. We do
several rollouts every day. We are data-driven and do extensive A/B
testing. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers.
If it doesn't help our customers, we're not interested in doing it.

As a Perl Developer, you are responsible for the development, performance,
and scaling of our public website as well as internal systems, which
includes using: Perl (5.14), DBI, Mason, Moose, Sereal, Plack, nginx,
Javascript, MySQL, Memcached, Redis, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, git, and CentOS
Linux. You will work independently and will also be responsible for making
technical decisions within a team.

Software developers work from our headquarters in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. We are inviting CVs from candidates worldwide. Even without
Perl experience, your colleagues will help you get up to speed in order to
be able to start solving real problems from day one. Are you ready to join
an international, result-driven, fun, and dynamic environment?

Required skills:
Your Role at Booking.com

- Rapidly develop next-generation scalable, flexible, and high-performance
systems
- Explain current systems, coach and train new developers
- Solve issues with the site and internal systems, prioritizing based on
customer impact
- Act as an intermediary for problems, with both technical and
non-technical audiences
- Collaborate with Team Leaders and Product Owners to prioritize projects
 
Your Skills and Experience
- Pragmatic and proactive attitude, with excellent verbal and written
communication skills
- Four years experience with hands-on software development in Perl
(object-oriented is a plus)
- Experience with HTTP and server-side technologies (web servers, database
servers)
- Preferably university degree in Mathematics or Software Engineering
- Prepared to relocate to Amsterdam, the Netherlands

Desired skills:
Interested?

We offer a competitive salary, plus bonuses, with possibilities for
training and further career opportunities within our fast-growing company.
This position is open to candidates worldwide. We will assist you with a
relocation package, ensuring a smooth transition to working and living in
the Netherlands.
