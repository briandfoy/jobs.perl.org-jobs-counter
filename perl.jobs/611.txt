Subject: Experienced Perl Developer + Network Engineer available
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: jhfoo@postkid.com ("Foo Ji-Haw")

Hello there,

I would like to offer my services as an all-rounded systems and product
developer. I am mobile and am willing to relocate to just about anywhere.

Briefly speaking, I have developed high-volume (400,000-user) Perl-based
commercial sites for the educational industry, almost from the ground up.
The systems operate on both Windows and FreeBSD OS. I handle the daily and
long term operational matters on the system, from back-end firewall
configuration to performance monitoring, to handling fault calls. I also act
as the accounts manager and consultant for clients, understanding their
needs, transforming their feedback into service upgrades and feature
roadmap, and providing service quotations.

I believe strongly in the commercial viability of Perl as the dominant
language in a network-based system/ application. I also believe in the
Perl+FreeBSD+Apache+MySQL combination being the foundation for most web and
network applications. I would like to find a business that shares my belief,
and allow me to be involved in its commercial success.

I am seeking permanent employment or long-term contract (1 year) offers.

My detailed resume can be requested via my email: mysunshineman@hotmail.com

regards,

Foo Ji-Haw
