Job title:
Freelance Perl web developer, TTK, DBI, PostgreSQL

Company name: Pathmedia

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We need immediate programming assistance for a short term project
developing a web system to manage access to subscription web-sites.  

We are looking for an individual to work with us (remotely) rather than
outsourcing to another company, ideally you will be UK based.

The successful applicant will be working with a lead programmer who will
provide technical specification and coordinate development. 

We also have existing sites that need maintenance and a variety of other
projects coming up so there will be scope for more work if the initial
assignment goes well.

Required skills:
OO Perl, Template Toolkit, Class::DBI, PostgreSQL (Oracle is ok), mod_perl.


We will be building on Maypole (plus derived classes) running on FreeBSD
and Apache 1.3 with the Perl running under mod_perl.
