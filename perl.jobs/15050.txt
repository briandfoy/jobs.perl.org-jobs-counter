Job title: Web programmer

Company name: Greystar Solutions

Location: Atlanta, GA

Pay rate: USD 30k-100k+

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
GSS is looking for a minimum of two Perl programmers for a 100% telecommute
position. GSS has been in business for nearly 15 years; this job isn't
going anywhere, and we're looking for people interested in long term
employment.

Programming will be for an e-commerce web application--the
usual mix of new features, bugfixes, and misc. projects.

Our range of
compensation is wide for a reason--the more a potential candidate asks for,
the more we'll expect from them. We're open to paying > $100k/year, but
only to people who are going to be very useful to us, very quickly. OTOH, a
more modest compensation scheme comes coupled with more modest
expectations.

This project is 100% work-from-home, unless you are close to
Lehi, UT, in which case telecommuting is optional.

Desired skills:
Good character
Programming ability

*Perl experience (the job IS a Perl position, but we are willing to work
with people who haven't done extensive work in Perl, provided they can
learn sufficiently quickly)

*SQL, specifically, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

*Familiarity with Ajax, D3, Angular, Linux CLI, CPAN, Moose, OO Perl, etc.

*??? -- our projects vary wildly in scope and complexity; there's no
telling what additional skills might be useful; if you've domain expertise
in anything that could possibly be useful to a growing business, let us
know.
