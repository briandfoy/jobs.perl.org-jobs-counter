Description:
Hearst Digital Media is looking for software developers to work on dynamic
content websites, e-commerce systems, and in-house administrative /
reporting systems.  Our efforts are largely focused on new development
projects.

We strive to write clean object-oriented code and make judicious use of
CPAN.  We are open source friendly, both in terms of using and contributing
to open source. We have put a great deal of time architecting an efficient
and friendly development environment.

In addition to other engineers, you will interact with designers and a
marketing staff to build great online products for a variety of websites.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential.

We have positions located in our New York City (midtown) office.

Required skills:
Strong Perl development skill, significant experience working in a Unix
environment (preferably Linux), and some relational database (MySQL
preferred) experience are all an absolute must. Previous work with secure
servers and ecommerce systems is a plus . A working knowledge of HTML, XML,
and JavaScript is expected. Any experience with AJAX is also a plus.

Desired skills:
This is a software development position, however experience with mod_perl,
MySQL, and/or HTML::Mason is a big plus. Other things we 'd find to be a
plus are experience with Apache configuration, Linux system administration,
and any database administration.
