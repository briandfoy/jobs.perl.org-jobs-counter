Description:
One position for a mid-level web services developer available immediately.
The position is on a team of ~6 developers working on a system which
enables our operations staff to provide financial services to mobile phone

We are a smallish group with aggressive goals and aggressive schedules. We
seek to do ever more interesting things with disruptive technology. All
employees have options in the company, and we are collectively working to
grow their value.

Some travel to other Cibernet locations, particularly Maryland and London,
England, is possible, as needs dictate; candidates should have, or be able
to obtain, a valid Passport. Telecommuting for some portion of the work
time is negotiable for suitably self-directing candidates after an initial
ramp-up period.

Required skills:
• perl in cgi-bin and batch processing environments on Unix systems
• experience in shell programming, preferably rc and/or sh
• experience with writing database-centric applications
• strong written and verbal communication skills

Desired skills:
• experience with AT&T/Lucent "post" or "pq" systems highly desired
• experience with financial transaction processing
• knowledge of GSM data clearing or roaming operations
• experience with Plan 9 or plan9port / Plan 9 from User Space
• experience with Apache, preferably Apache2
• JavaScript, HTML, CSS, &c.
• experience with Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server
• experience working in a collaborative environment
• source code control, preferably SubVersion
