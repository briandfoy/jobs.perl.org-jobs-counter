Job title: Server Side Developer For The Register

Company name: Situation Publishing LTD

Internal ID: perljob

Location: Edinburgh, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Situation Publishing, owner of The Register (www.theregister.co.uk), is
looking for a full-time software developer/sysadmin to work on server side
Perl code and Debian-based servers.

You'll work in our Edinburgh office, doing a combination of software
development and on-going maintenance and tasks such as log reporting,
server monitoring, applying software updates and system tuning to ensure
the availability and quality of our online presence.

Broadly put, we favour open source: we use Debian/Ubuntu, Perl, Apache,
Exim, MySQL & Postgres in our stack. We rely heavily on Git for process and
revision control. We sometimes write our own tools. Our business is on the
web, so while HTML, Javascript, and CSS skills are not required they are
desirable and you would be expected to become familiar with them over time.


Our Edinburgh tech team is small, focused and has a good degree of
autonomy, so you need to be able to produce great work without a carrot or
stick and be comfortable communicating with the wider business via email,
phone, instant messaging and online tools such as Wikis and Google Docs.

We offer a competitive salary based on your experience; company pension
contribution; and 25 days annual holiday.

Required skills:
Excellent English, communication skills, and the legal right to work in the
UK.

Experience writing Perl, or excellent skills in a similar language and be
happy to bend them to working with Perl

Debian/Ubuntu experience and comfort with the shell

Good knowledge of Apache

Comfort using software revision control (e.g. Git)

Comfort using SQL (“raw” and through abstractions like DBIx::Class)

Desired skills:
Debian package management, and day to day system administration

MySQL and Postgres

(valid) HTML, Javascript and CSS

Familiarity and experience with server virtualisation

Testing and monitoring

Mail servers (e.g. Exim)
