Job title: Perl Applications Engineer

Location: Internet

Pay rate: US$DOE

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We're looking for a Perl applications engineer to join our growing Perl
team to build and maintain OpenAPI/Mojolicious services. You'll also be
called on to build new features in a large legacy Perl application.
Experience with Mojolicious, Postgres, and Docker is helpful but not
required. The job is entirely remote, so you'll need to have strong
communications skills, be self-managing and driven, and always have an eye
for high-quality results. We're a friendly, collaborative, and
progress-oriented environment where your work can have significant impact.

We're looking for someone sufficiently experienced enough to work on
projects solo as needed without the need for oversight. Viable candidates
will have a track-record of self-motivation, high attention to detail, and
ability to work very independently. Those authorized to work in the United
States are encouraged to apply; we are unable to sponsor H1B candidates at
this time.

Desired skills:
Desired skills for the position include strong coverage of a mixture of the
following in descending order of importance:

- Perl applications design
and development
- MVC application design in a Mojolicious or Dancer-like
framework
- Effective and professional communications and collaboration
soft-skills
- REST web services with a full Perl stack including API design
- Linux system administration and networking
- Docker or similar container
technology
