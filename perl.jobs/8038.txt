Job title:
OO Perl / *nix - heavy server side dev - SSH - small company, big results

Company name: GridApp Systems

Location: United States, NY, New York City

Pay rate: DOE + options

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Looking to connect to experienced Perl developers with some team lead
experience. Heavy backend object-oriented Perl development environment in
Linux/Unix (many flavors). Client side is PHP, Perl, JavaScript, SOAP,
AJAX, etc.

Oldest version of Perl supported is 5.8.7 (although we might migrate to
5.10 on all supported platforms once it is burned in).

As Open Source fans, we’ve incorporated many CPAN modules including:

As far as coding conventions, we use PBP and peer review (use strict; and
use warnings; are mandatory). Warnings are fatal (causing a die to occur).
All code must compile on all supported platforms prior to commit (Linux,
Solaris, Win32, HP-UX, AIX, others).

Required skills:
* OO Perl (C++, PHP receive bonus points)
* TCP/IP networking and/or distributed systems programming
* Experience with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL
* Fluency in Linux (flavors of UNIX receive bonus points)
* Team lead experience receives bonus points

Desired skills:
Simply, an unbridled love of Perl.
