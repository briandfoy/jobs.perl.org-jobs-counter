Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: ADNET

Internal ID: SS062

Location: Greenbelt, MD, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 1 year

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Solar Data Analysis Center (SDAC) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, MD is seeking a programmer to support the development and
maintenance of the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO).  The VSO provides
search and retrieval access to space- and ground-based observations of the
Sun.  The VSO provides a SOAP API for web-based and command line clients,
and uses SOAP internally to communicate with distributed data archives.

The primary task will be integration of new datasets into the VSO. This
task entails working closely with data providers to understand data
products, writing connectors to make their data available via the VSO SOAP
API, and often reconciling differences between data models.

Additional tasks include monitoring, tuning, troubleshooting, and other
general maintenance.

The position will be with ADNET, under NASA's SESDA3 contract.	For more
information, see 
http://www.sesda3.com/careers/ss062-senior-software-engineer/

Required skills:
US Resident or Permenant Residence (ie 'green card') status (yes, I know
that's not really a skill, but it's still required); 

2+ years of Perl;

2+ years of SQL (mySQL or PostgreSQL preferred);

2+ years with MacOS X, Linux, BSD or other POSIX environment;

1+ year of SOAP or other API experience (SOAP::Lite experience preferred)

Desired skills:
Experience coding in a security conscious environment;

Familiarity with scientific data;

And that long, bloated list of keywords that they didn't let me put in the
official description: Java, Python, pgplsql, C, MacOS X, CentOS, HTML,
JavaScript, apache, WSDL, REST, IA, data modeling, UX, ontologies, search
engines (building, not using).
