Subject: Seeking a Perl related remote internship (not paid)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: marco@vittorini.org (Marco Vittorini Orgeas)

Hello,

I'm a computer science student approaching the graduation phase and I'm in 
needing of earning some credits by experiencing an 
internship with some business and if possible I'd like to experience some Perl 
related task.

Perl is my go-to scripting language since 10 years, I like the language 
expressiveness but wherever I look it's a springling of python/php/ruby 
related jobs/internships.

I would like to give an hand with some relatively small/medium 
task (1-2 months of work) and maybe more (considering my current load of 
work).

I've seen around that the Perl foundation is participating in open source 
coding programs for students like Gsoc but it seems I'm too late to join Gsoc, 
but should the Perl foundation or some other business/not for 
profit/association entity need some hand for 
some job/task floss related (and even not) I would be very happy to help!

I'm quite versed in Perl and I'm good at sysadmin related tasks 
too (coming from a Linux/UNIX experience and heritage): to see something I can 
point you to http://mavior.eu/apt-log (it's something I've not touched in a 
while).

I hope that this is the right list to ask of such things, but of course if 
somebody out there have additional suggestions to where I could look at to get 
some job/internship opportunity in Perl related things I will surely dig more.

Thank you.
