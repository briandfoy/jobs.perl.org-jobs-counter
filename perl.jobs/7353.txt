Job title:
Converting flat file DB perl script into MySQL

Company name: Not Applicable

Location: Guatemala, Solola, San Pedro

Pay rate: open, flexible

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: On project completion basis

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am not a programmer but taught myself perl for the only purpose of
building a Community Portal database driven and templetized.

All parameters that run this portal are currently saved in Flay Files.

Your job entails to translate the saving of data in MySQL and then the
template that displays the portal which now reads  all the parameters from
flat files, you need to make it read from the MySQL DB.

You need to bid for coding a single instance of saving data into the MySQL
DB. I will multiply that number into how many time saving takes place
throughout the script to find out how much I need to pay you.

Required skills:
I nderstand that perl is not the most suitable scripting language to build
a heavy traffic site. Most people are suggesting Python, PHP, ASP, .Net,
etc.

But perl is the only language I understand so I dont want to learn another
language, besides the portal is already built in perl. It would help if you
have experience and skills in speeding up perl to make it work faster... so
that it can sustain heavy traffic.

I understand that there are technologies or tools that make perl work
almost as a compiled language rather than having each request interpreted
one by one.

Tools like VELOMETER, VELOCIGEN, Mod Perl, and Perl Server Pages.

if you understand any of these technologies.. or you are profficient in one
not memtioned here that may help speed up perl.. then you have a second
job. 

Over and above the translation into MySQL I would ask you to speed up the
functionality of the portal adding whetever code is needed. (please quote
this task separatelly).

THIRD TASK: The language of the portal plus all of the Back End (Admin
Control Panel), is currently in Spanish. I need every phrace saved in a
Language file (perhaps XML). This way the portal can be easily translated
into any language. (This task quoted separatelly).

Desired skills:
VELOMETER, VELOCIGEN, Mod Perl, and/or Perl Server Pages as well as XML
