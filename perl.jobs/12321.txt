Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: ChargeSmart/Verifone

Location: San Francisco, CA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
ChargeSmart is a thriving and innovative payments company within Verifone
(NYSE: PAY). We're seeking multiple senior Perl developers to build
advanced web applications.

What we use:
* Clean, modern OO Perl - Moose, PSGI/Plack, Dancer, DBIx::Class,
Perl::Tidy
* Linux, Apache/mod_perl 2, svn, mysql (possibly postgresql in future),
memcached

We've got a strong team of Perl developers including several prolific CPAN
authors.

Our office is in the heart of San Francisco's financial district, though we
are growing fast and will be moving to a larger space near Montgomery St
BART soon. Primarily seeking locally based permanent employees though we're
open to contract-to-hire.

ChargeSmart has three main products:
* Bill Payments - on pace to process $250 million dollars of consumer
payments in the coming year
* Direct - providing merchants a turnkey e-commerce solution for accepting
credit card payments on their site
* Mobile - poised to make a huge impact in the disruptive mobile payments
space

ChargeSmart recently became part of the Verifone family, which gives us
greater market opportunities and the resources to offer competitive
benefits and salaries.

Please reply with resume (text format is fine) and details about your Perl
and software engineering experience. Code samples from CPAN or github a
plus. Look forward to hearing from you!
