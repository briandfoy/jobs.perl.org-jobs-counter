Job title: Bioinformatics analyst

Company name: Congenica Ltd.

Location: Cambridge, Cambridge, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The demands of our growing company mean that we need to expand our
bioinformatics team. We need someone with experience of working on
variation analysis of high-throughput sequence data, ideally with a
clinical focus. As part of a small team that analyses clinical data,
implements new methods and functionality and creates databases a broad
range of technical skills is essential.

Automation and scalability to
enable processing of thousands of samples is key so experience of working
with large compute clusters and developing pipelines to run in such
environments is important. An understanding of the biology involved in
determining how genetic mutations cause disease is a definite plus. Weâ€™re
working with real clinical samples so the ability to develop systems and
working practices accordingly is essential. The data you will be analysing
will directly impact patient diagnoses.

Desired skills:
Strong programming in Perl and/or Python

Broad knowledge of NGS data
analysis and interpretation tools eg BWA, GATK, ensembl

SQL Database
knowledge ie Postgres / MySQL, Oracle. Schema design and manipulation,
scripting data entry and query, basic administration.

Exceptional
candidates without direct sequence analysis experience may be considered.
