Job title: Perl Web developer 

Company name: ChannelMeter

Internal ID: Emp1-dev

Location: USA , CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: Negotiable (USD)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent 

Hours: Full time

Description:
Are you a smart, hungry Perl web dev?	Want to be employee #1 at a funded
startup doing YouTube analytics?  We'll give you a moderate salary, great
equity, and a whole lot of responsibility. We'll expect brilliance,
motivation, blood, sweat, and tears. 

Preference will be given to San Francisco Bay Area residents.  We will
consider telecommuters who are no more than 3 time zones away PROVIDED THEY
ARE US CITIZENS / HAVE A GREEN CARD.

Why take this job?  We're on the final countdown to launch, we've done no
marketing and we've already got hundreds of customers, major corps asking
to sign up, and videos about us popping up on YouTube. 


Required skills:
- Perl

- US citizen or green card

- Fluent written and spoken English

- As stated above, preference will be given to San Francisco Bay Area
residents.  We will consider telecommuters who are no more than 3 time
zones away PROVIDED THEY ARE US CITIZENS / HAVE A GREEN CARD.

We care more about your character and learning speed than existing skills.
We can teach you Catalyst but not how to be smart or motivated. 

Desired skills:
Serious data management experience in MySQL, meaning:

- Determining appropriate indices and caching strategies for tables with
tens of millions of rows and >1M rows added daily 

- Optimizing website performance to serve data from said database with
sub-second response time.  

- Catalyst

- DBIC
