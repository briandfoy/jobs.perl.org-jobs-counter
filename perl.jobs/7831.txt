Length of employment: Long term

Hours: Flexible

Description:
We are looking for a web developer: Perl, SQL, WWW - either Full or Part
Time

Long term and stable position - with real prospects

You could work in three locations - London EC3, south Suffolk/ north Essex
or the Dartford/ Erith area (any of these bases would be fine for us)

We are looking for an enthusiastic web developer with knowledge of Perl and
SQL - as well as general web technologies - HTML, JavaScript, CSS etc

You will be working alongside existing developer to improve and maintain a
high traffic automotive site. 

Some experience ideal, but enthusiasm and eagerness to learn equally
important

Would suit someone looking for commercial experience and wishing to expand
their skillset (and ideally, someone who enjoys cars)

Most of all, we value (and reward) skill, initiative and consistency

So the financial package is open to negotiation - based on a demonstration
of your abilities (both initially and over time)

We are reasonably flexible on your working hours, so the pay package may
also reflect the time you agree to put in (if part time)

Required skills:
Perl, SQL, DBI or Win32::ODBC, Javascript, HTML, CSS
