Job title: Contract mod_perl / CGI programmer

Company name: Madberry.com

Location: United States, NH, Durham

Pay rate: $4k - $6k / month USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Seeking 40 hr / week contract Perl programmer with substantial web
development experience.  Successful candidate will work on end-user facing
web applications, data entry interfaces, unit tests, data scrubbing /
loading scripts, and more.  The position begins in September.

It's important that you be comfortable with a development process that
begins with a light spec and a chat about features.  You would then develop
the first version, and expect to iterate that version based on feedback. 
You will NOT be handed a detailed 20-page spec and asked to implement it
exactly.  I believe strongly in the importance of unit tests, and I would
expect you to develop a strong suite of tests with each application.

The position is located in Durham, NH, though there is a possibility that
the successful candidate could telecommute two or more days a week after
the first month.  

Required skills:
Perl (please don't bother to apply unless you have several years full-time
experience with Perl)
Confidence with HTML::Mason, Class::DBI, HTML::Template, CGI::Application,
Test::More and AJAX
Attention to detail

Desired skills:
Familiarity with CVS and/or SVN
Experience coding to Mechanical Turk's API
