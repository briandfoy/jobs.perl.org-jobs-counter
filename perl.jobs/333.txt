Subject: [HIRE ME] Gifted Person for Hire
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: solution@gina.net (Aaron Johnson)

That's right Gifted Person for hire, but only for a limited time because
when he's gone he's gone.  Can he code Perl?  You betcha.  Does he bath
and comb his hair?  You betcha.
Does he know everything about everything? No, but he's willing learn.

So who is this Gifted Person and why would I care?  Aaron Johnson and
you care because you want a bright friendly smiley face warming your
cubicle or a friendly professional voice on the phone as your go to guy.

So how do I get this Gifted Person?  You just visit this web address,
http://www.gina.net/resume.html then dial the number on your screen and
ask for Aaron. It really is that simple.


Aaron Johnson
Shameless self-promotion

I posted this to the mod_perl list as Genius for hire, but I found out
that an IQ of 130 is only gifted so I changed it to gifted person.  I
still think Genius sounds better.  :)
