the database every time the subscription cycles.

for {domain ordered} {planordered} {first name}

domainnames. Checkbox to register the domain under the same details left

under a different name.

updtaes 
added that will talk to the same API



6. Automatic email reminders of domains that will be expiring on 30, 15
and 0 days till expiration. Copy to admin and end-users email on file,
Script validates the end user email address and 
notifys admin of any bounce of attempt to notify end user.



7. Customer login area needs place for customer to update their credit
card information to their accounts. 



8. Existing affiliate system needs a web based signup form for would-be
affiliates.

invoices. It needs to send indefinate reminders until the invoice is
marked as paid

assigned to.



11. Active server module needs recoded so upun approval the admin
canspecify the server to add the domain to.
