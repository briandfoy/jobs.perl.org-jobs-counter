Description:
Betonmarkets.com is looking to recruit a Senior Perl Developer (telecommute

Betonmarkets.com is a financial betting website operated by Regent Markets
Group Ltd., a company with offices and staff in a number of jurisdictions.
Founded in 1999, the company has grown to become a leader in the fixed-odds
financial betting field, with over 200,000 registered accounts and over
$120 million/annum turnover. The company
is affiliated to Regent Pacific Group, a company listed on the Hong Kong

We are looking to recruit a Senior Perl Developer to further develop the

strong experience and talent in software development (notably in a
Linux/Perl environment), the ability to work within and manage a very large
codebase, is conscientious and self-motivated, exhibits interest (and
preferably prior experience) in the financial markets, and shares the
company's vision of creating a competitive market in limited-risk financial
betting products.

The job will entail refactoring legacy code into properly architectured
Moose objects, development of new financial betting products, interfacing
to financial data feeds, development of financial charting facilities,
integration with payment, marketing, accounting, and risk management
systems, development of website white-labels, and working
with our financial mathematics (quant) team on the proper code
factorization of complex derivatives pricing models. The company has a
developer-lead culture and the successful applicant is expected to
participate in the development of the company's IT strategy.

The position is full-time and applicants may be located anywhere in the
world. The company leverages the latest internet-based communication tools
to manage distributed Scrums and projects.

Required skills:
Perl, Linux, Moose, Catalyst, Postgres, SQL, Apache, Javascript, jQuery,
JSON, AJAX.
