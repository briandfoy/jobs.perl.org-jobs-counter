Job title: Perl ETL Developer

Company name: AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)

Location: TX, Austin

Pay rate: $50+/hour, doe

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 months (possible subsequent renewal or FTE hire)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're seeking a Perl developer with experience in backend analytics systems
and reporting.

We are looking for a seasoned developer (NOT a scripter!) to join a team of
three other Perl developers that's responsible for maintaining and
enhancing a legacy ETL system that loads engineering microchip test data to
a MySQL database. Much of this system was developed by others and is in bad
need of refactoring.

Since stabilizing and scaling this system is of primary concern, there may
be opportunity to port code to, and work with newer tools in this space
such as Hadoop.


Required skills:
You must have solid Perl development skills; have experience writing
modular code; be proficient with the ins and outs of Perl's OO system; be
comfortable in a Linux server environment; and have a good grasp of SQL
queries and optimization strategies.

A code sample is HIGHLY encouraged from any serious candidates.


Desired skills:
Pluses: experience with Java, PHP, or the R statistical language, MySQL
administration/tuning, and experience with query optimized Data Warehouse
schemata such as the star and snowflake patterns.

BIG Pluses: Perl Unit Testing literacy, Agile (Scrum, XP, TDD), 'Modern
Perl' conventions and modules, and being a CPAN author.
