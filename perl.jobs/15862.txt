Job title:
Escape London - Mid-to-Senior Perl Developers in the Midlands (visa
sponsorship possible)

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: West Midlands, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Varied role solving real business problems for clients, working with open
source software all day - in one of the few places in the UK a house is
still affordable.

Client has been a long-term supporter of Perl
development, and the technical team is headed up by a very well-known
figure in the community. Development stack is a hybrid of a strong Modern
Perl stack and more legacy code.

Ideally the team is looking for more
menders: developers who love refactoring, or editing code to enhance
clarity. Bug fixes genuinely excite them and they get a little giddy about
testing.

Team is hiring a couple of developers, and while they have their
seniority preferences, would love to talk to anyone talented who’s avoiding
moving to (or indeed, looking to escape) London…

Also: the company is in a
position to sponsor workers without an existing right to work in the UK;
assuming they are already in, or able to easily get themselves to, the UK
for interview.

Desired skills: Modern Perl is a must
