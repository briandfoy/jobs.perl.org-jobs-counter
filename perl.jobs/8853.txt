Description:
Our company needs help with a WWW::Mechanize script which logs into a
vendor website and accesses their product database.  Most of the script has
been written but the program files at a page that submits a form after
running some client side Javascript.  We have tried to emulate that
Javascript in code but all of our attempts have failed.

The job, then, will be to modify our existing code to find a way around
this roadblock.

SSH access to our test environment will be provided.

Required skills:
Perl
WWW::Mechanize
