Internal ID: dev-se-001

Location: United Kingdom, Berkshire, Maidenhead

Pay rate: £40K

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
I'm looking for an experienced web developer / software engineer, with
plenty of experience in PHP and Perl.

Our service converts voicemail to text, and sends it to your mobile phone,
and /or you email address. It has been running live for over a year, with
tens of thousands of users.

The system is almost entirely built from open source technologies: a large
body of Perl (SOAP services, scripts and admin tools), but also C and PHP.
The voicemail system uses Asterisk. Currently we use a mix of PostgreSQL
and MySQL, but are looking to go to a single RDBMS.

We have a number of web sites which are all built on PHP, with SOAP
middleware in Perl. You will take responsibility for the existing web
sites, with one of your first tasks being a redesign / overhaul. There are
a number of additional web sites and web services we will be building over
the next year.

The work environment is relaxed and informal.

Required skills: PHP, Perl, linux, PostgreSQL or MySQL

Desired skills: SOAP, SMS, C, Asterisk
