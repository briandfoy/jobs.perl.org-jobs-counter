Job title:
Senior Developer at a small, profitable web services company

Company name: MaxMind

Pay rate: $100-140k/annually

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for an experienced developer to help
make the Internet a safer place to do business. MaxMind offers web services
and downloadable databases focused on IP intelligence and fraud detection.
We are planning new projects as well as improvements to our existing
services.

Your job will be to carry out development projects both big and small. You
may work on data collection improvements for our fraud system, fixing bug
in our open source APIs, or developing an entirely new service. We're
looking for an experienced software developer who can make good technical
design decisions, write tests and documentation, and communicate with
non-developers.

We're a small, privately held company (under 20 employees) founded in 2002,
and we've been profitable for many years. As an employee of MaxMind, you'll
enjoy the flexibility and autonomy that come with being a member of a small
technical team. Since we are profitable, our focus is on exploring new
ideas and doing things well, rather than rushing work to market. We're a
casual, friendly, results-focused company. We want you to get things done,
but it's also important to have a life outside the office. We won't be
asking you to stay late or pull all-nighters on crazy deadlines.

Transaction fraud detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is
never done. Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection,
which means we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud
detection service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP
product, which associates geographical data with individual IP addresses.
We screen half a billion online transactions each year and provide IP
intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

Our office is located in downtown Waltham, MA outside of Boston, five
minutes walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus
lines. Local candidates are great, but we're also open to telecommuting. 

The vast bulk of our code base is written in Perl using MySQL and Linux,
with a bit of C where it's needed. We use free software as much as
possible, and we release code back to the community when we can do so.
We're trying to improve the way we do development, and we expect you to
participate in that process. We are working to add more tests and
documentation to our code base, and all new work goes through code review.

This position is for an experienced developer. The salary range for this
position is from $100-140k per year.

Minimum Qualifications:

* Dynamic language programming experience. We use Perl but we're happy to
hear from Javascript, PHP, Python, or Ruby developers as well.
* Experience developing for deployment on a Linux or BSD platform.
* Experience writing tests and documentation.
* Experience doing code reviews.
* Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
* The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.

Bonus skills:

* Web development, especially RESTful web services.
* Data analysis, number crunching, and math skills.
* Experience writing C, especially libraries.
* FS/OSS contributions. Tell us about them!

To apply, please email your resume to senior-developer-job@maxmind.com as
an attachment or link in PDF, HTML, or plain text format. Resumes in other
formats will not be considered.
