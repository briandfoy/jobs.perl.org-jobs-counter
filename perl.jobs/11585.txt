Description:
An award winning service provider urgently need 2 senior perl developers
working to develop, enhance, maintain and support the company’s hosted
services. The applications delivering the services generally have an
interactive user interface component delivered as dynamic web pages over
the Internet as well as a series of significant server based data

as a Perl developer. Experience of NoSQL datastores and ecommerce/billing

The role offers the opportunity to work in a small company setting with
other highly skilled developers to produce high quality software where good
work is both recognised and rewarded. You will work in a dynamic mixed
skill development team, using Scrum to deliver new product features every
4-6 weeks under the direction of the CTO. You will be comfortable using
different technologies/languages as necessary to meet overall team
objectives, though remain an expert in your area of experience. You will
have the opportunity to lead development cycles, provide creative solutions
to challenging problems, and integrate with other industry leading
products/services via API (e.g. Facebook Connect, OAuth, eBay, etc.). 

Required skills:
* Over 3 years experience in Perl (OO)
* Moose / Catalyst
* SQL and relational data modelling skills
* Experience developing in the LAMP stack
* OO design skills, including the ability to apply appropriate OO patterns
