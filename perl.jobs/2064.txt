Los Angeles Based Search Engine company is in need of a hardcore Perl/C/C++

importance. 
  
The ideal candidate will have strong C/C++ and Perl skills, and firsthand
experience and understanding of the tradeoffs of using C -vs.- Perl. 
Candidates should also have a strong ability to grasp, track, and summarize
large data sets (e.g. log files from a web server) as well as high
availability environments where downtime is just unacceptible.	Candidates
should also have strong experience with databases, sockets, XML, and a
basic level of understanding of UNIX operation skills (DNS, web servers,
etc.)

Skills Required:

•	Must have 4+ years of experience in software development in an
enterprise UNIX environment.
•	Perl (5.8 preferred)
•	Strong C and/or C++
•	Apache Modules
•	SQL Databases (Postgresql/Mysql)
