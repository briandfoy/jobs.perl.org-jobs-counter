Parasol Solutions is a UK based software house and consultancy company
with a very strong perl background. We employ a number of perl mongers
and perl monks and will, in time, be looking for more. Anyone wanting
to submit their CV for future consideration may do so.

We are not the next CGI company. Our perl skills stretch into Data
Munging, Corpus Linguistics and Bioinformatics. We have a strong
academic knowledge coming from various Computing, Science and Maths
backgrounds.

Our experience covers multiple business sectors with some of our most
notable perl work including the proprietary search engine for
www.towebpages.com , statistical genetics work for Astra Zeneca,
network management tools for Alcatel and data analysis for WhiteCross
systems.

The directors of Parasol Solutions, also seasoned perl programmers,
hand pick the employees to ensure only the best people make up the
project teams.

As a company, we believe in getting the job done right and on
time. Our Services web page describes the company attitude and
ethos.

So, if you want top perl people to provide you with high quality
solutions without the baggage associated with the next software house,
please get in touch.

Regards

Steve Marvell
