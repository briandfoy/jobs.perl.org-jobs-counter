Job title: Contracted Situation Manager

Company name: Troy Research

Location: United States, OH, Columbus

Pay rate: Negotiable, US $

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
This position is two-fold. The person selected for this position will be
responsible for responding to new software 'cases' (sometimes called bugs)
on our proprietary online survey engine and taking appropriate action to
solve them. This includes discussing potential solutions with a manager,
implementing solutions, assigning solutions to applicable experts and
occasional preventative maintenance.

This position will also require the hiree to complete occasional tasks and
projects that require creative problem solving, but may be very easy or
'menial.' These tasks include pulling data from databases for clients,
managing 'go-live' projects and making manual database changes (this is not
a data-entry position, these manual changes are typically small or better
done with a script).

The right candidate for this position will be a self-starter who can teach
themselves based on source code. While the person hired will recieve
training on our software (paid of course), they will also be expected to
learn most of it themselves (paid, of course).

This is a part time position, 10-15 hours a week is my best estimate. Do
not apply if you would rather do heavy coding projects or database design.
Please see my other job posts, as we are looking for people like that too.

Required skills:
Perl
Database Tools
Linux Use
Excel (It is mandatory that you have access to a PC)


Desired skills:
Salesforce.com
Linux Administration
