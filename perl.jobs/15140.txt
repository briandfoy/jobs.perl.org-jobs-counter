Job title: Perl developer for pure-Perl company

Company name: BookTrolls LLC

Location: Houston, TX

Pay rate: $100K/yr

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
BookTrolls is looking to hire top-notch developers to help fuel our rapid
expansion. Our entire software infrastructure is pure Perl, under Linux.
This will not just be a software integration/automation position. We use
Perl to write enterprise-class TCP/IP servers and back-end applications
that run the entire company. We write software for a wide range of business
applications for internal users; and both our culture and our development
model are pretty informal. Hours are flexible. Leadership opportunities are
available , as we're doubling in size every two years and expanding
internationally. Our software team is small, fast, and flexible; and we
offer a greater degree of creative control, project ownership, and career
growth than you'll find at most any other company. Plus, you can ride the
forklift. This position is ideal for an ambitious, energetic self-starter
with a mastery of Perl.

We offer a 401(k) with 100% match of up to 4% of
salary, with immediate vesting, plus medical and dental. Telecommuting is
not an option for this position, but we do offer relocation assistance to
Houston and visa sponsorship.

About Our Company

We are one of the largest
independent booksellers on the Amazon and eBay marketplaces, among other
online marketplaces. Located in Houston, we sell purely online and ship
from our Houston warehouse. We started in a garage in 2007 and have since
expanded to 75,000 sq ft and over 100 employees, doubling sales and
inventory roughly every 2 years. Our main competitive advantage is our
in-house software, which runs every aspect of our business and possesses
capabilities unseen in our industry. Most of our competitors run their
companies off shrink-wrapped 3rd-party vendor software (and it shows.) We
are not a software company, but software is at the core of what we do.

Please note that our main website (booktrolls.com) does not reflect the
primary business model that this position will support.

Desired skills:
- Thoroughly fluent in Perl, preferably writing more than just "glue"
scripts
- Fluent in object-oriented design, and regular expressions
-
Familiarity with Perl Apache CGI scripts
- Linux command line skills,
including file manipulation, file editors, grep, etc
- Excellent code
documentation skills

- Multi-threading experience, including deadlocks,
race conditions, and apartment threads
- Familiarity with BerkeleyDB, HTML,
JavaScript, client/server programming, and system-level Linux skills
