Job title:
Perl/CGI/Linux/MySQL Wrangler for Social Community

Company name: Antopia Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Pay rate: $30/hr USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
Need a perl/CGI MySQL and linux developer who can help us to build out
features and functionality on a social community website. 

The position is project-based, meaning that while we are working on a
project, the successful candidate would be working fairly consistently.
When we're between projects, the only time needed would be for bug fixes
and odd jobs. We will be doing a small project to start, and depending on
how that goes, this could become a long-term position. The position will
normally require no more than 10-15 hours per week, but that might go as
high as 40 hours a week during crunch times.

Required skills:
Perl 5, CGI, MySQL, image::magick. Need someone with experience with
high-traffic membership-based websites.

Desired skills:
Some design experience, some css experience, a little bit of Javascript
would be very useful. Hoping to find someone with experience in removing
cruft. We need someone who can be professional and produce
professional-looking results.
