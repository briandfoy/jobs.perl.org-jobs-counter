Job title: Software Support Technician

Company name: Plain Black Corporation

Location: United States, WI, Madison

Pay rate: 35-45k

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Plain Black (www.plainblack.com) is looking for a Perl programming, Linux
using, ssh connected, GEEK! We're not looking for your run of the mill
technician; only geeks should apply. We want you to know and love
technology. We want you to not only have heard of operating systems other
than Windows, but to have used them. And most importantly, we want you to
be hungry to learn more every single day. If this sounds like you, continue
reading, else go read some other job descriptions. 

On a day to day basis you'll be asked to support our clients using WebGUI
(www.webgui.org). You'll need to be patient, and able to support novice
users all the way to programmers. For this reason you'll have to have at
least some Perl programming experience. You must be both self-motivated and
a good communicator. You'll work with technologies such as Perl,
Javascript, MySQL, Apache, and Linux. Be prepared to think on your feet,
plan ahead, and fly by the seat of your pants...it just depends on the day.


Other duties will include bug fixing, performance tuning, software
installs, and release management. We are a small and rapidly growing
company so everybody does a little of everything. There is plenty of
opportunity to grow into other positions such as research and development,
client services, and project management.

At Plain Black Research and Development is part of the Support Department.
We feel that in order to be truly in touch with customer need, you have to
see where they're struggling. Therefore being part of the support
department means you'll also be actively involved in the research and
development of our future products. You'll be assigned R&D projects to add
features to the core of our open source software system, WebGUI as well as
our other products and services. This is a great opportunity to be directly
involved in an open source software project.

Compensation, Benefits, and Perks 
- $35k to $45k depending upon experience. 
- 100% paid health insurance and dental. 
- A new high-end MacBook Pro. 
- An expense account. 
- Profit sharing. 
- Annual cost of living increases. 
- Ultra-flexible paid time off. 
- Telecommute from home. 
- On the job training.


Required skills:
- Be as patient as the day is long.
- Be a geek. 
- Be a U.S. Citizen as we do lots of work for the Federal government. 
- Have experience with Perl, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- Have experience with operating systems other than Windows.
- Have experience with software systems such as MySQL and Apache. 
- Be a great communicator. 
- Be self-motivated.
