Job title:
Blog Developer for media and software companies

Company name: Apperceptive, LLC

Internal ID: App-009

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: Competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our work is fairly evenly split between Movable Type, Typepad, and custom
web app development. We build the web sites other people play with when
they're bored at work.


NYC greatly preferred, this is an hourly position probably moving to full
time after a 90-day evaluation period. The pay is good. Our clients include
the Gothamist, Six Apart, NBC, the Washington Post, Serious Eats and other
top media/Internet names.

Required skills:
We're looking for someone who loves programming, blogs, a little
javascript, python or ruby and a lot of perl. We're more interested in
meeting a good person than filling a specific job description, so please
send us your resume if you're a close fit for the above requirements.
