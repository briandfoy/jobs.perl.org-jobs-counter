Job title:
Perl Webapp Developer in the exciting document compliance industry

Company name: Lucidoc Corporation

Internal ID: SD12

Location: United States, WA, Redmond

Pay rate: DOE + benefits + stock + bonus

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you're excited about the compliance industry (and who isn't) and have
some of the following qualifications, we would love to know more about you.
 Even if you're not sure what this compliance stuff is (it does seem
esoteric at times) or you suspect it might be extremely boring (this is
true for most people), then you still might want to check this out. We
think writing software that makes our customers awesome at managing
documents and heroes when it comes to being audit-ready at the drop of a
hat is actually kinda fun and very challenging. And frankly, we're warming
up to all this compliance stuff.  There's documents, revision histories,
meta-data galore, workflow (state) diagrams, hierarchies, pointers going
every-which-way, and even a good use for cryptographic checksums. Managing
document compliance looks a lot like a good distributed source code
management system when you look at it that way. So, have a closer look. If
you're self-driven, love challenges, enjoy working with other geeks, and
have at least half these qualifications (and want to develop the rest),
then we want to hear from you.

Our team is small, the job is daunting at times, and we need more talent to
meet our development roadmap goals. You would be working on and using our
core product, the Lucidoc Compliance Management Solution application; a
web-based system largely developed in Perl, SQL, and JavaScript that has
been in production use for ten years. Naturally, some of the work involves
maintenance and customer support. But our primary efforts go toward adding
new features based on customer, business, and market needs. Our management
team is dedicated to keeping distractions to a minimum and roadblocks out
of the way (although, they occasionally get through as I'm sure you're
familiar with).  The development team takes responsibility for deciding how
things will be implemented within the framework of the development roadmap.
We also have a lot of input into our future technical strategies.

We're not just looking for another coder with the technical chops on some
list of bullet points. We want someone who embodies The Three Great Virtues
Of A Programmer. Someone with the fortitude to bring order to chaos,
clarity to over-cleverness, and elegance to clumsy, brute-forced code.
Someone fearless yet vindictive when faced with spaghetti code. Someone who
demonstrates eternal vigilance against code entropy. Someone who strives to
keep up with evolving development standards in web application
infrastructure.

Required skills:
This list is not necessarily complete but rather intends to give one a
concept of the kind of developer we hope to work with. We don't expect
anyone to make a "perfect score" and prefer that we are all striving for
some unattainable perfection. A link to a more detailed job description is
provided below.

 - Significant knowledge of and experience in Perl programming.

 - At least 5 years experience developing web-based applications, including
working with session data storage, relational databases, caching, and
inter-process communication.

 - A solid understanding of the "separation of concerns" and how it relates
to a MVC application.

 - Experience and competence with Linux/UNIX, Subversion, Git, Mercurial or
similar version control system, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and XML.

 - Understanding of professional software development processes. Including
familiarity with the cycles of requirements definition, issue tracking,
version control, automated testing, deployment and maintenance and Agile
development methods.

 - The ability to think and make decisions rapidly based on business
criteria, not exclusively on technical priorities.

 - Clear and articulate communication, both written and spoken.

 - Forward thinking mindset and the ability to consider future growth and
analyze scalability of existing systems and software, and to apply those
insights to current development.

 - The ability to quickly understand requirements, documentation and
contribute code towards various project deliverables in a timely and
professional manner is required.

 - Taking initiative beyond minimum expectations to determine long-term
successes of the company.

 - Provide guidance and mentoring regarding best practices and software
industry standards, code design and implementation.

 - Perform code reviews.


Desired skills:
Expertise with: JavaScript, mod_perl2, Oracle 10g database, MS SQL Server
