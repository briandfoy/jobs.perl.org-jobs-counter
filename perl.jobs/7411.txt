Job title:
OO Perl Developer in an Agile environment

Company name: AirWave Wireless, Inc

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of our time
writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback loops speak
louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings. We
practice test-driven development and have a comprehensive suite of tests...
over 26,000 at last count. We pair program, so you'll learn the system
quickly and have a great time doing it. We have short release cycles, which
means your talents won't sit idle working on projects that never see the
light of day. Software you write today will be managing enterprise networks
in just a couple of weeks. We've been cited as the longest running
continuous XP project in the industry (five years and counting) so we have
gotten quite good at embracing advantages while avoiding its pitfalls.

Excited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. Airwave developers write software
in several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux
systems. We use Apache mod_perl2 for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for
our back-end persistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge
of network protocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP.

Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task, but our products help to
ease that burden. We build network management software that is used by many
of the leading IT organizations at Fortune 50 companies, major
universities, hospitals, and other prominent institutions. Our
industry-leading software helps plan, configure, manage, and monitor some
of the largest wireless networks on the planet.

Required skills:
Strong OO skills
OO Perl
Strong refactoring and design ability

Desired skills:
Experience with agile software development
Linux application development
Apache mod_perl
Basic SQL (PostgreSQL experience a plus)
Experience developing automated tests
Knowledge of TCP/IP and 802.11 wireless networking
