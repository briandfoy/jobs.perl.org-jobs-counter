Location: United States, IL, Chicago

Pay rate: USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
The Department of Medicine's small IT group is expanding and is looking for
someone with the talent to co-manage our "professional activities online
database", assist with an upcoming website migration to a CMS system,
provide a minimal amount of (second-level) computer support to faculty and
staff, ...  

Since the IT staff is small, you’ll be responsible for many different
tasks.

The professional activities system is written in perl and mod_perl and runs
on Oracle and FreeBSD.	Since this system is the authoritative source of
data in many cases, there is a ton of integration work between it and other
systems within the department and university-wide.

Required skills:
A bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, similar IT related area, or
equivalent experience is required.  Upcoming or recent graduates are
encouraged to apply!

You should have experience programming database driven websites using
apache, perl, CGI, DBI, and SQL; experience with mod_perl, Oracle, MySQL,
FreeBSD, and CVS is beneficial.

Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential to maintain
productive interactions with administrators and faculty at all levels.

Contact information:
Please *write a cover letter* and submit it with your resume (*MS Word or
PDF formats only*) to jobs@medicine.northwestern.edu.  We are looking for
local candidates only.
