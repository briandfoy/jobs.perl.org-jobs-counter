A client of ours in San Antonio, Texas is looking for a Perl Programmer

The assignment will involve the transition of support for an internal

Additional Info

They will create some new code which may 
be in Perl or Java depending on the scope of the change, as well as
modifying 
existing Perl code as needed. Will not be a wholesale conversion, 
but over time we would like to consider converting the Perl code to Java. 
If this resource only knows Perl it would just mean they would roll 
off the project and be replaced by a Java resource if we got serious about 

a conversion effort. The focus is definitely on Perl before Java 
at this time. 


Required skills: Perl 5 or higher

Desired skills: JSP and Java
