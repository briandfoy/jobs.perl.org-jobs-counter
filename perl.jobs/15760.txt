Job title:
Convert Apache2::FileManager From mod_perl To FastCGI

Company name: Auto-Parallel Technologies

Location: Austin, Texas

Pay rate: US $75 Fixed Rate (negotiable)

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am the new owner of the Apache2::FileManager (A2::FM) distribution on
CPAN:
https://metacpan.org/pod/Apache2::FileManager

I need A2::FM to
integrate seamlessly with a Catalyst application called ShinyCMS:
https://github.com/wbraswell/myshinytemplate.com

Catalyst apps are
supposed to work with both mod_perl and FastCGI, but unfortunately ShinyCMS
seems to be triggering a difficult-to-repair segfault when run using
mod_perl:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=118899

Currently,
A2::FM only works with mod_perl, which means the only 2 solutions we can
pursue are either fixing the segfault (not this job), or converting A2::FM
from mod_perl to FastCGI (this job).

We need to retain mod_perl
capabilities for backward compatibility, so really this job is to ADD the
ability for A2::FM to run under FastCGI while KEEPING the ability for
A2::FM to run under mod_perl as it does now.

ShinyCMS also comes with a
PSGI test server for use when Apache and FastCGI are not installed or
configured.  We need A2::FM to work with the PSGI Plack test server as
well, which is launched via the following command and temporarily binds to
localhost port 3000 for testing and debugging purposes:
https://github.com/wbraswell/myshinytemplate.com/blob/master/script/shinycm
s_server.pl

I have created an installer script which makes it much easier
to install all the necessary software components for a full ShinyCMS
installation, although it requires some advance knowledge and guidance the
first time you run it:
https://github.com/wbraswell/lampuniversity.org/blob/master/bin/LAMP_instal
ler.sh

This job will be considered 100% complete and payment will be
rendered when the following 4 goals are met:

1.  A2::FM can run
stand-alone under mod_perl (already achieved, keep existing functionality)

2.  A2::FM can run stand-alone under FastCGI (new functionality)

3. 
A2::FM can run integrated with Catalyst app ShinyCMS under FastCGI (new
functionality)

4.  A2::FM can run integrated with Catalyst app ShinyCMS
under PSGI Plack (new functionality)

Desired skills:
Perl
mod_perl
FastCGI
Apache2
Catalyst
ShinyCMS
