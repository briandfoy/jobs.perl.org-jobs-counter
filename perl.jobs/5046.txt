Description:
This position is open to telecommuters.

The Maize Genome Project is a federally funded, multi-institutional effort
to sequence the corn genome. Given the complexity of the genome, a team at
CSHL has been charged with the task of automatically analyzing the genome
as it is sequenced and providing a graphical browser of the data for the
maize community.

We are looking for a skilled software developer to engage in the design and
development of an automated annotation pipeline that will analyze maize
sequences on a regular basis. The position demands creative thinking and a
top-to-bottom understanding of core software concepts. The position focuses
on new development and requires very little maintenance.
 
We are looking for people who are passionate and committed to software
engineering principles. Ideal candidates will have solid experience with
web technologies and databases as well as a reasonable background in
biology.

Ideal candidates must work cooperatively and productively with other team
members. We promote personal enrichment and community involvement through
technology exchanges, code reviews, and participation in lectures,
workshops, and conferences, both locally and remotely. You will likely
participate in the publication of research papers.

Responsibilities:
You will work within our team primarily on the implementation of an
automated annotation pipeline for the Maize Genome Project. You will also
be involved in implementing new features for the maize genome browser.

As an active developer, you will engage in most aspects of the software
life cycle, including requirements gathering, software design and analysis,
implementation, and testing. You will be writing software documentation as
well as technical research papers or sections therein.


Required skills:
A major programming language (Perl, Java, C/C++, Ruby), SQL, Unix-based
systems. Master's degree in Computer Science (or related field) plus a
minimum of 4 years experience, or Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (or
related field) plus a minimum of 5 years experience as a software engineer
performing duties similar to those above.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills are a must.

Database experience includes database design, development,
object-Relational modeling, and performance tuning.  Web development
experience includes writing static and dynamic web pages, templates, and
server-side applications.


Desired skills:
General understanding of and experience with: web-related design patterns
such as MVC; source control management software such as CVS, Subversion, or
Perforce; software testing principles; Ensembl technologies.

CVS, Subversion, Apache, JavaScript, XML, CGI, Servlets, unit-testing. 
Familiarity with basic concepts of molecular biology and bioinformatics is
preferred but not required. Familiarity with various bioinformatics APIs is
also preferred.
