Job title:
Senior Scientific (Perl) Developer - High Throughput Gene Targeting

Company name: Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute

Internal ID: 80893

Location: United Kingdom, Cambridge

Pay rate: 27.3k - 37.69k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 3 years

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are seeking an experienced software developer to join the informatics
team in the High Throughput Gene Targeting group. We work on a number of
projects that aim to make a rich variety of mutations in Embryonic Stem
Cells, to help the scientific community research gene function. The ideal
candidate will be an excellent Perl programmer with a strong interest in
bioinformatics and the support of leading-edge research in molecular
biology.  You will be working as part of a small team developing software
to support the laboratory's production pipelines, and will work closely
with our molecular biologists to ensure that the software you deliver is
effective.

The Sanger Institute’s High Throughput Gene Targeting Team has played a
central role in a number of established large-scale international projects:
EUCOMM (http://www.eucomm.org), its extension into the EUCOMMTools project
(http://www.knockoutmouse.org/about/eucommtools), and KOMP
(http://www.knockoutmouse.org/about/komp). We  are also a principal
contributor to the IDCC project (http://www.knockoutmouse.org) which
presents a coordinated public face to the established high-throughput mouse
knockout projects. The next few years promise to bring a wealth of
challenge and excitement for our group, in terms of the variety of work we
will encounter, the scale of throughput that we will support, and the
implications that the work will have in the study of gene function in
mammals.

Our software ranges from plate-tracking, to sequence analysis, to data
warehouses, often with Ajax-driven web interfaces, and is implemented using
Modern Perl technologies such as Catalyst, DBIx::Class, and Moose. Our
external-facing reporting software is deployed here:
http://www.knockoutmouse.org/martsearch  and here:
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal . You can find out more about the mouse
mutagenesis projects we are involved in here:
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/mousedevelopmentalgenetics/.﻿
In addition to contributing to these projects, this position will allow the
postholder to collaborate with other scientists and bioinformaticians
working on site.

Required skills:
You must have:
- Experience and fluency with Perl
- A good working knowledge of database design and SQL
- An interest in bioinformatics 
- An ability to learn quickly on the job
We work as a close team, so good communication skills in the context of the
team are important.

Desired skills:
Desirable skills are
- Prior experience in bioinformatics and sequence analysis
- Knowledge of an MVC framework such as Catalyst or Ruby on Rails
- Experience of Modern Perl technologies such as Catalyst, DBIx::Class,
Template Toolkit, and Moose
- Design and implementation of web-based user interfaces using Javascript
libraries such as jQuery or ExtJS
- A qualification in Biological computing is not essential but an interest
in the science and ability to learn fast is key. The campus runs frequent
courses to allow staff to augment their technical skills.
