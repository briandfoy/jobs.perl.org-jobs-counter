Job title: System Architect

Company name: Online Talent Manager

Location: Breda, The Netherlands

Pay rate: 3500 euro

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
OTM is a personality test developer. The system maintains and develops
psychometric instruments, tests candidates, generates reports, and has an
API (SOAP). After 15 years, I want to try something new, but the system
lives on and someone needs to take over and grow it farther. Lot's of
opportunity to move bits of this to another language (if you want to) and
you will be the whole IT department. Personality testing is a deep subject,
you will have a lot of opportunity to learn new things.
Act fast, if I
cannot find a good candidate, this whole thing gets handed over to a
development bureau and they'll just rewrite everything in PHP and screw it
up.

Desired skills:
Template::Toolkit > HTML > wkhtmltopdf > PDF reports
SOAP (maintenance)
(the current API)
REST interface building (the new API)
SVG (graphic
representations of results and making programs to manipulate those images)
Statistical Analysis (analysis of results)
Plack (the testing machine is a
standalone Plack server)
The rest of it is Perl and web development. If you
are good with Javascript, that would probably help you in cleaning up and
improving the user interface.
