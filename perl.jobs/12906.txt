relevant data in order to make judgment calls for grey-area alerts

assessment, log correlation, application security, etc)

    Develop and implement tools and procedures for deploying and
maintaining secure configurations on SNS internal systems
    Work with other SNS staff to maintain integrity and functionality of
SNS systems and services
    Perform additional incidental IT security and operational support
duties as assigned

IPv6 concepts: IP protocols, firewalls, packet capture techniques)
    Basic knowledge of encryption theory and practice
    Passion for IT security
    Clear, concise writing ability

Desired skills:
Web development (especially using Catalyst)
	Any operational info-sec experience (intrusion detection,
