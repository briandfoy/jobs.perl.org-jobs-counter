Job title:
Write a companion module to WWW::Monitor::Task

Company name: Promethues Labor Communications

Location: United States

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Description:
I'm looking for a Perl script to help me monitor when a web page changes.
I've investigated WWW::Monitor and a script that works with it, webmon.pl.
The module's big limitation though is that it monitors the whole web page.

I would like to extend the usefulness of the WWW::Monitor::Task module so
that only portions of the page are monitored.

Required skills: Familiarity with HTML parsing.
