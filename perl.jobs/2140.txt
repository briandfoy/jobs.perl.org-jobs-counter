Description:
Google.com Engineering

Are you part ace coder, part adrenalin junkie? Do you have a knack for
seeing a problem and immediately discerning the likely solution? Maybe
you've been coding for years, are bored with the old
design-build-review-test-ship-repeat routine, and yearn for some
faster-paced challenges? Or perhaps you're a seasoned software engineer who
is also a genius at jockeying networks and administering UNIX clusters. 
 
We're looking for top-notch thrill seeking, software engineers to join the
Google.com team. Google.com engineers are in the thick of everything
involved with keeping Google running, from code-level troubleshooting of
traffic anomalies to maintenance of our most cutting edge services; from
monitoring and alerts to building new automation infrastructure. We are
aggressively building this elite team of high level engineers in this
mission critical environment. All team members must have strong analytical
and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding, good communication skills,
and most of all enthusiasm for tackling the complex problems of scale which
are uniquely Google. Google.com engineers tackle challenging, novel
situations every day, 
and work with just about every other engineering and operations team in the
process.
 
Important: The subject field of your email must include Senior Software
Engineer, Google.com, Dublin or Mt View
