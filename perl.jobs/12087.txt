Location: Brno, Czech Republic

Pay rate: negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Why NetSuite?

Picture yourself building a successful career at NetSuite—working alongside
other talented, driven individuals to help fast-growing mid-size
organizations and larger enterprises achieve their business goals with the
world’s #1 cloud-based business management suite for ERP/financials, CRM,
ecommerce and more.

Founded in 1998 by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and NetSuite CTO and Chairman
Evan Goldberg,
NetSuite (NYSE: N) is used by more than 10,000 companies and subsidiaries
to run mission-critical operations without the high capital costs and
inefficiency of antiquated client/server systems. Named by Gartner as the
world’s fastest-growing financial management vendor and winner of a
prestigious 2011 CODiE award for Best Financial Management Solution,
NetSuite is where business is going. 

Summary:

Assist Senior Development team to Evolve often minimally-defined client
business requirements into professional quality NetSuite OpenAir solutions
which satisfy not only that client, but have the flexibility and
customizability to be used by clients with differing business processes and
needs.	These solutions may require the conceptualization, design and
implementation of a full-blown NetSuite OpenAir Module, they may require
evolving the system with architectural extensions or they may dictate a
minimal tweak to existing functionality. 

Support the Senior Development team to scope out the impact of an
implementation by considering all of the necessary changes and any impact
they may have on other parts of the product.

Work in the NetSuite OpenAir development environment which is defined by
ASP deployment, a rapid release cycle and based on the “Extreme
Programming” software development discipline combined with the NetSuite
OpenAir operating principle of customer service orientation.  This
environment mandates that bug fixes impacting clients take precedence over
both quick on-demand enhancements and longer term “planned” development
initiatives.   It also means that quick on-demand enhancements often take
precedence over previously planned initiatives. The rapid release cycle
insures that features that are pushed out past a release date because of
this operating principle can be addressed in either the next scheduled
release or slip-streamed in the interim.  This environment insures that we
have a high level of confidence in setting client expectations.

Required skills:
•	Support Change Guides both peers and staff through changes in the
business organization; keep them informed and develop strategies, with the
guidance of management team, for dealing with resistance to change.
•	Research new technologies that can be leveraged for improvements to
the application or towards improvements in efficiencies and make Senior
Development team and management aware of findings.
•	Work with Senior Development team to maximize efficiency and
harmony of operation for achieving end result.
•	Complete projects and tasks on schedule with limited post
deployment support issues.
•	Ability to communicate effectively orally and in writing with
NetSuite colleagues and some clients.
•	Professional business acumen required with colleagues and
customers.
•	Critical thinking, takes a logical approach to analyzing problems,
developing solutions, and organizing work. Exercises sound judgment.
•	Work at a high level of productivity.
•	Provide end to end software solutions with minimal QA support.
•	Ability to learn how to prioritize Production Support as the
highest priority.
•	Ability to focus solutions that benefit the needs of the many
rather than those needs of the few.
•	Focus always on the customer experience that is the core of our
business and success.
