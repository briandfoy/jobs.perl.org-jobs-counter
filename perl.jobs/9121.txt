Job title: Software Maintenance Programmer

Company name: Plain Black Corporation

Location: United States, WI, Madison

Pay rate: $45k + $16k benefits

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Plain Black (www.plainblack.com) is looking for a Perl programming, Linux
using, ssh connected, GEEK! We're not looking for your run of the mill
programmer; only real geeks should apply. We want you to know and love
technology. We want you to not only have heard of operating systems other
than Windows, but to use them regularly. And most importantly, we want you
to be hungry to learn more every single day. If this sounds like you,
continue reading, else go read some other job descriptions.


On a day to day basis you'll be asked to solve problems that make most
programmer's minds melt. You'll be responsible for refactoring API's to
make them more useful. You'll be responsible for writing a better test kit
for WebGUI (www.webgui.org). You'll work with the WebGUI community both in
fixing bugs and rounding out the rough edges. And you'll also be in charge
of release management, including refining our release management tools to
make your job easier. You'll need to be patient, and able to converse
novice users all the way to programmers while doing these tasks, because
you're building this software for them, not you. For this reason you must
be both self-motivated and a good communicator. You'll work with
technologies such as Perl, Javascript, MySQL, Apache, and Linux. Be
prepared to think on your feet, plan ahead, and fly by the seat of your
pants...it just depends on the day. 

We are a small and rapidly growing company so everybody does a little of
everything. There is plenty of opportunity to grow into other positions
such as research and development, client services, and project management. 



Compensation, Benefits, and Perks 
$45k, plus a $16k benefits package including:
- 100% paid health insurance and dental. 
- A high-end MacBook Pro. 
- An expense account for books, travel, and other business needs. 
- Profit sharing. 
- Annual cost of living increases. 
- Ultra-flexible paid time off. 
- Telecommute from home. 
- On the job training. 

Required skills:
- Be a geek.
- Be a U.S. Citizen as we do lots of work for the Federal government.
- Be an object-oriented Perl whiz.
- Know Javascript as well as you know Perl.
- Have experience with SQL and an RDBMS like MySQL.
- Have a firm grasp of HTML and CSS.
- Have experience with operating systems other than Windows.
- Be a great communicator.
- Be self-motivated. 

Desired skills:
- Experience with YUI.
- Experience with a version control system, like Subversion or git.
- Experience developing Apache / mod_perl applications.
- Experience with the WebGUI API.
