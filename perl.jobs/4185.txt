Description:
We are looking for a talented individual with solid analysis and design
skills to fill a senior developer role. We are an established e-business
solutions provider based in Wimbledon (SW19), with a range of clients from

supervision of other members of our development team. 

We offer a friendly and relaxed working environment - we even have a pool
table in our meeting room. 

Candidates must be based in the UK and have current permits to work with no
restrictions.

At least 4 year's commercial experience (or equivalent demonstrable levels
of skill) with: 

Perl (OO and CGI)

Desired skills:
Template Toolkit 
MS SQL
