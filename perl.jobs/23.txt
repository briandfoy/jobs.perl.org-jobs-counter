Subject: Looking for Perl Projects
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: slloyd@inshift.com ("Steven Lloyd")

I am currently looking for perl projects to work on.
I have a considerable amount of experience with MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL,
MS-Access, and other databases.
I am comfortable developing on both Unix and Win32 platforms.

I am willing to work hourly  or bid on contracts.

If you need collaborative web-based applications built, intranets,
extranets, or would just like your website to be dynamic, I can help.

My resume can be found at www.wordperfect.com/slloyd
