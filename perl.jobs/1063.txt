Description:


I'm looking for a person who knows Perl inside and out to help with some
piecemeal work installing modules, updating scripts, and creating new
scripts.  I don't care about industry experience.  I simply need someone
who enjoys Perl in all its quirkiness.	If you're self-taught and
know/enjoy Perl, let me hear from you.

So we don't waste each other's time, these requirements must be met.
They're not negotiable:

1.  Reside in NORTH TEXAS area.

2.  Willing to sign an NDA (very reasonable).

3.  Willing to answer a few pointed Perl questions

4.  Knowledge of Unix (You don't need to be an expert, but you do need to
know enough to work remotely with a text-based editor, know how to
make/extract tarballs, move files around, etc.)

5.  Willing to enter into a performance-based contract.  There will be a
small fixed rate of payment, along with a performance-based incentive.	An
hourly-rate contract is not negotiable.

6.  Knowledge of the domain registration business is preferable, but n ot a
requirement.

This contract won't feed the family. I'm looking for a person who has a few
spare hours on their hands who are willing to trade their Perl expertise
for some spending money.  

Please respond via e-mail with a summary of your Unix and Perl experience. 
If you don't have any industry experience, tell me about Unix and Perl
things you've done on your own.  No attachments please!
