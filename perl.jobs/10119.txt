Location: United States, Texas, Bedford

Pay rate: $50-55.00

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 4 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Perl programmer that understands multi level bom structures and can easily
translate ascii file data to create other ascii files used to load this
data into our system. SQL and Reporting using Cognos would be a perfect
fit. Also, load data into our MatrixOne PLM system.  We have a collection
of spreadsheet text files and document files on disk that have to be
organized and have files created in support of getting them uploaded into
our system.  This will not involve oracle at all.

Required skills:
Assist with data integration associated with a recent acquisition. A 
person who can generate scripts to parse/manipulate spreadsheet data (CSV)
and re-format it (another delimited text format file) specific to system
load file requirements. Having SQL or cognos reporting experience would
also support this initiative. The data associated with this initiative is
related to materials, BOM's and associated documents.  Also need  to take
multi-level BOM information and generate single level BOM's from that info.

Desired skills:
Perl
