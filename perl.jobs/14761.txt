Job title: Amazing Perl Developer

Company name: Traveltek Ltd.

Internal ID: SDEVAWESOME

Location: United Kingdom

Pay rate: Up to £38,000 DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're looking to add some new people to our already extensive team, and are
on the hunt for senior programmers who think they have what it takes to
master Perl. Perhaps you're already a Perl expert, or a PHP, Python or Ruby
programmer who is looking for a new challenge. We deal with more code (3
million lines and counting) and more data (hundreds of millions of rows)
then you've likely come across before, but if that sounds like fun, this is
the place for you.

Some knowledge of Linux or other flavour of UNIX would be a plus, as this
is what our whole platform runs on. Some database experience is definitely
a must, MySQL especially. And as you will be dealing with customers and we
pride ourselves on good service, good communication skills are key.
Finally, you'll need a willingness to learn. Almost everything we do is
likely to be new to you, and you should be ready for a challenge.

The successful applicant can be based anywhere in the UK, but will require
regular trips to our Head Office in East Kilbride. Salary up to £38K DOE.

This position is subject to pre-­employment checks including Disclosure
Scotland screening.

Applicants who meet all the conditions above are invited to apply by
following the instructions found at
http://www.traveltek.net/recruituk.phtml

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL

Desired skills:
- Perl
- Apache
- Linux
- mod_perl
- XML
- Mojo
- Memcached, Redis, Gearman...
