Job title:
Midlevel and Sr-Level Perl Developers for Online Advertising Industry
Leader

Company name: ValueClick Media

Internal ID: 11191

Location: United States, CA, West L.A. or Westlake Village

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We’re looking for a rare breed…the right blend of tech geek brilliance,
sharp sense of humor and good old common sense to make you dangerous. We
hire only the most talented engineers who enjoy a lot of autonomy and room
to experiment. The fact that we deal with high volume transactions (how’s
close to hundreds of thousands of hits per second sound?) and extremely
large data sets makes our blood flow. We see almost everything we touch go
into production and have a direct impact on how ValueClick has become one
of the top, most profitable companies in the space. All this without crazy,
inhumane hours and with plenty of time to play. This is why we come to work
every day ready to save the world. Or at the least, ready to create some
really, really high quality software.

Essential responsibilities:
You’ll be developing new products or enhancing features of software
applications that power any one of our many systems: ad serving, behavioral
targeting, real-time bidding and account management portals. You’ll be part
of a 5-6 person SCRUM team, but we often cross-pollinate your skills
amongst other teams and projects if you show the initiative and ability to
contribute. We need you to be involved in all phases of the development
cycle: design, programming, testing at the unit and system level, debugging
and internal documentation. Our Agile process enables us to have a very
short feedback loop with our product owners, so when you’re not coding,
you’re working with our product managers to get things just right. 

Required skills:
Instead of worrying about how long you’ve been an engineer or working with
a specific technology stack, we’re more focused on how quickly and
independently you’ve proven to design and develop solutions when given the
problem. We’re pretty language agnostic and if you’re a polyglot, you’ll be
in good company. We do, however need you to be interested and able to work
with:
• Perl, OO Perl, mod_perl, some C/C++
• Linux including Apache web server
• Databases such as Oracle or MySql


Desired skills:
• HTML5, Ajax and similar technologies
• Agile development process (2 week sprints, daily standups, software that
actually works and is released while it's still relevant)
