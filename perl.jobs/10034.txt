Desired skills:
The following are highly desired:

    * Experience administering issue tracking systems such as Jira
    * Experience administering a Subversion server and supporting various
Subversion clients across Windows, Mac, and Linux
    * Experience working with globally distributed development and QA teams

    * Experience leveraging virtualization to effectively utilize storage
and computing resources and to provide high availability to critical build
and test systems
    * Experience as a software engineer using common IDE and tool chains in
multiple environments (e.g. MS Visual Studio, Eclipse, XCode, gnu c/c++,
etc.)
    * Experience in teams operating in an Agile development process
including iterative development, continuous builds and TDD using tools such
as VersionOne, BullsEye, and Coverity
    * Experience supporting cross-development environments for embedded
systems development is a plus
