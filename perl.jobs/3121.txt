Company name: End Point Corporation

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Growing consulting company End Point Corporation seeks a Perl expert with
solid relational database experience to develop web applications using the
Interchange web application server. Especially interested in individuals
experienced with PostgreSQL, including complex SQL queries, PL/pgSQL or
PL/Perl functions, and rules, triggers, and views.

Our developers interact directly with our clients via telephone and email
on a regular basis, so verbal and written communication skills need to be
excellent. Good candidates pay attention to detail, are careful with
production systems, and code defensively to provide good stability and
maintainability of mission-critical systems.

This is a full-time salaried position. Employees work either at our office
in Manhattan, New York, or from home offices, and must live in the 48
contiguous United States and have US citizenship.

Required skills:
* Perl (regexes, DBI, complex data structures, common CPAN modules)
* Web application development
* Solid PostgreSQL and/or MySQL database experience

Desired skills:
* Exposure to the Interchange application server is a plus,
and willingness to learn it a necessity (see http://www.icdevgroup.org/ for
details about Interchange)

* Basic Unix/Linux system administration skills and security awareness
