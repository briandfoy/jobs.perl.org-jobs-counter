Job title: Development Manager

Company name: Broadbean Technology Ltd

Internal ID: DEVMAN

Location: Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
*** YOU MUST BE ELIGIBLE TO WORK IN THE UK ALREADY, AND ABLE TO WORK
ONSITE; PLEASE, NO RECRUITERS *** 

We're looking for an exceptional Development Manager to lead our growing
product development team in the UK. Reporting to the CTO, you'll be
responsible for a team of ten Perl developers (really it's three small
teams), and for helping us to introduce best-practice programming. 

The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed: we have
a range of codebases, from a continuously deployed and properly tested
product on Dancer and Plack, to an application which is being gently
converted from CGI and with no tests. We have buy-in at a group level to
aggressively tackle our technical debt, and you'll be a big part of that.

The role will be 50% hands on, and 50% leadership - you'll help the team
with code reviews, and architectural design - but you'll also need to be
able to get your hands dirty when required, perhaps by pair programming
with team to help them learn good test design, perhaps picking off
complicated features to serve as example code, or perhaps helping to debug
a particularly tricky UTF8 issue.

You'll help identify and prioritize the most pressing pieces of technical
debt, help to plan and execute a move to cloud infrastructure, and be a key
part of keeping our excellent team atmosphere as we expand. You'll stretch
our development team to implement new technologies and exploit existing
ones like Puppet and Pinto, you'll be able to recognize and grow technical
excellence, but you'll also be able to choose appropriately between "new
and shiny" and "tried and tested". You'll have great instincts on
engineering practices, and have opinions on where monitoring, process, and
tests move from "exceptionally useful" to "intrusive".

We're a small company (90 people in the UK), owned by a very big company,
and a great place to work. Post-probation we offer (non-contractually)
flexible working and 50% telecommuting. We've got an engineering team of 30
and are fully committed to Perl, clearing our technical debt, and doing
things the right way moving forward...

Required skills:
Very strong "Modern" Perl is a must, as is some experience leading teams
and line management. A very healthy amount of Real World Experience, and an
ability to apply that experience to new problems is a must.
