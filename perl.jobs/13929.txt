Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Location: Somerville, MA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We're Best Practical Solutions, a small software company located in
Somerville, MA. We build software and sell support, training,
consulting, and custom development. Our flagship product, RT (Request
Tracker), is the premiere open source issue tracking system. Our
secondary product, Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR) is the
leading open source incident handling system for computer security teams
and is widely deployed across security, academic and government
agencies.  We've been around since 2001 and are entirely self-funded.

We think Best Practical is an awesome place to work. Our jobs are
enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding, with talented coworkers who know
how to have fun.

We're looking for a software engineer to help us enhance and refine our
products, and as well as to be excellent to our customers. You'll be
responsible for everything from implementing new features, to testing
and applying user-contributed patches to our released software. In a
typical week, you'll probably spend about half your time working on
internal and open source projects, and half working on customer
projects; this requires good communication skills, as well as a desire
to help customers get the most out of our software.

The hours are flexible, and we all telecommute some of the time...though
we work from our office in the heart of Davis Square, Somerville on most
days. While we do a fair amount of our collaboration in-person, you
should also be comfortable using email and instant messaging to
coordinate and get work done, as we have a few employees in other parts
of the globe.

Required skills:
You should be a self-starter who either has solid experience with Perl,
or significant experience with similarly-flavored languages (Python,
Ruby, etc) and a willingness to pick up Perl quickly.  Some experience
with at least a few of the following buzzwords is also desirable:

 * Open source development practices (code review, backcompat)
 * Distributed source control (git, branching, patches)
 * Test driven development (smoke testing, Test::More)
 * User interface design (HTML, CSS)
 * Documentation (user-facing, API)
 * Javascript (jQuery, AJAX)
 * SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite)
 * Optimization, profiling, and debugging (nytprof)
 * UNIX systems administration (webservers, mailservers)

It's okay if you don't know everything out of the gate, but you should
be able to learn on the fly and be comfortable asking questions when you
get in over your head. RT is a large codebase to dive into, so you
should be prepared to work with a project that's too big to hold in your
head all at once. If you want to see what sort of trouble you're getting
yourself into, you can find all of our open source code
[on github](http://github.com/bestpractical).

We're a small company; you should be comfortable working both
independently and in small teams, and prioritizing tasks on your own.
Being able to task-switch efficiently and juggle several projects at
once is a necessity.
