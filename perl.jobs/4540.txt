Description:
 One of our unique attributes is our use of the latest technology. For this

small team of developers. Working alongside project managers, developers
and business psychologists you will be involved in developing new products

You will be a confident individual, keen to learn and comfortable working
within a small team environment. You will be expected to be confident,
polite and (mostly) patient - your written and spoken English communication
skills should be excellent. You should have strong client- and server-side
skills - and if you can describe how you have innovatively used AJAX and a
decent database, along with either Perl, PHP, C or ASP.NET then we reckon
this will be a whopping advantage for you. Given the multiple roles and
responsibilities within this role, time management skills are essential.
