Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Location: Somerville, MA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
About Us

We're Best Practical Solutions, a small software company located in
Somerville, MA.  We build software and sell support, training, consulting
and custom development services.  Our main main products are RT (Request
Tracker) which is the premier open source issue tracking system and RTIR,
our open source incident handling system that has been designed with the
needs of CERT and incident response teams in mind.  We’ve been around for
over a decade and things just keep getting busier.

About the Job

We are looking for a motivated, customer service oriented engineer to
participate in all aspects of the software development cycles including
requirements gathering, design, development, implementation, upgrades,
maintenance and documentation.	You will be responsible for ensuring that
new or upgraded systems are fully deployed and functioning per the clients
specification.	You will also design and code new functionality or add new
functionality to our products to add new features.  Other responsibilities
will include debugging issues and correcting defects reported by our users,
testing new releases and updating code to address errors and overall
performance.  We work in a very dynamic and fast paced environment so you
will need to be flexible to handle a consistent variety of things on a
daily basis.

Location

You will be working from our office in Somerville, MA.	The hours are
somewhat flexible (East or West coast business hours), and we all
telecommute some of the time...though we work from our office in the heart
of Davis Square most days. While we do a fair amount of our collaboration
in-person, you should also be comfortable using email and instant messaging
to coordinate and get work done, as we have a few employees in other parts
of the globe.

Required skills:
You should be a self-starter who has 3+ years experience with Perl, as well
as some experience with at least a few of the following buzzwords:

*  Open source development practices
*  Distributed source control (git, branching, patches)
*  Test driven development (smoke testing, Test::More)
*  User interface design (HTML, CSS)
*  Documentation (user-facing, API)
*  Javascript (jQuery, AJAX)
*  SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite)
*  Optimization, profiling and debugging
*  UNIX systems administration (web servers, mail servers)

It’s ok if you don’t know everything out of the gate but you should be able
to learn on the fly and be comfortable asking questions before you get in
over your head.  Being vocal is a really important quality and being able
to manage competing priorities with the help of your colleagues and project
manager is key.  RT is a large codebase to dive into, so you should be
prepared to work with a project that’s too big to hold in your head all at
once.  If you want to see what you’ll be getting yourself into, you can
find all of our open source code on github.
