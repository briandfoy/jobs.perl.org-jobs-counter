About Us

BlueHost is one of the fastest-growing Internet companies in Utah, and THE
fastest-growing web hosting company in the world.  Come work with top
talent in an energized, success-oriented (and profitable) start-up
environment.  We offer competitive pay and benefits and a great environment
(like break rooms complete with free food, ping pong, foosball, and arcade
games, regular visits from a masseuse, not to mention a free web hosting
account!). If you are a Perl guru, and thrive on working with other smart
and talented people, then we need you on our team! 

What We're Looking For

    * Talented Perl programmer -- You have been around the block a few
times and are comfortable using Perl to make web apps work.
    * Object Oriented Perl -- You think Perl is more than "just a scripting
language" and know how to make it do things others cant.
    * Web Experience -- You are familiar with how the web works, and can
hit the ground running writing web applications and tools.
    * Team Player -- You work well as part of a team, and are willing to
take direction, but can be trusted to get things done on your own.
    * Hard Working -- Once you get your bearings, you are heads-down and
tenacious in completing assigned projects


Required skills:
Qualifications
   
* At least 3 years experience as a Perl developer
* Must be competent developing Web applications and system utilities
* Must be able to create Perl modules
* Must be competent with object oriented Perl
* Must be knowledgeable with Linux and basic system administration
* Ability to stay on task, solve problems, and accomplish tasks in a timely
manner.
