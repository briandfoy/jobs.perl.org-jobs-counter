Job title: Perl Developer (no Perl experience required)

Company name: Lokku

Location: Clerkenwell, London

Pay rate: £25,000 - £35,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Lokku is seeking intelligent, motivated and forward thinking developers to
work on our primary product, the Nestoria property search engine, and to
help us continue serving millions of house hunters in eight countries and
six languages.

The challenges we face at Lokku are similar to those faced by larger search
engines such as Google. On the one hand we have a huge amount of data that
we need to analyse, clean up, extract keywords from, geocode and
de-duplicate. On the other hand we have a very popular website that needs
to remain highly stable and lightning fast.

You will be a part of the development team which maintains and improves
these systems. You will not be restricted to any one part of the code base;
you will work on projects which range from backend processing and internal
tools to the interactive website and its heavily customised search-time
code.

Required skills:
Maybe you are looking to make the move to a tech team which embraces the
principles of clean code, best practice development methodologies, and
user-centred product planning. Perhaps you crave a role in a smaller,
tightly-knit team which affords you a higher degree of responsibility and a
more diverse range of juicy projects to work on. Or maybe you can't wait to
get your hands on our databases and start mining for new insights that we
can use to help our users.

We are relaxed about your personal motivations, as long as you have the
following:

•Experience with Perl…
•    … or with other scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, or
JavaScript
•Experience developing on a Linux platform
•Experience with SQL-based relational databases
•Knowledge of the internet and of web development
•Excellent technical communication skills
•A pragmatic and practical approach to solving problems

Desired skills:
It is also desirable but not essential that you have some of the following:


•Knowledge of modern client-side web technologies
•Ability to write and maintain C code
•Experience with internationalization and character encoding
•Good understanding of test-driven development
•Time spent using version control systems in a team environment
•Experience with writing systems which have to scale to large numbers of
users, database rows, etc.
