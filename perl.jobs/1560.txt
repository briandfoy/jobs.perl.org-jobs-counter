Job title: Whitebox QA Engineer

Company name: Tellme Networks

Location: United States, CA, Mountain View

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We have several open positions at Tellme. Tellme’s web backend environment
is mainly mod_perl based, involving externally visible, traditional web
applications, as well as internal VoiceXML applications and XML data feeds.


Tellme systems use HTTP and XML extensively as a generic data-passing
mechanism, and webservers are involved in everything from dynamic
configuration for our hundreds of production machines, to integration with
customer billing systems.

There are four QA positions open. Each QA will be responsible for
developing test plans based on design specifications, executing test plans,
and also writing and maintaining test scripts in PERL or a similar
high-level language. Additionally, they will contribute towards the success
of client projects by coordinating with project team members -- including
integration architects, developers, and project managers -- in order to
prevent, report, and resolve product defects.


Required skills:
- BS Computer Science, or an equivalent combination of education and
experience 
- Strong communication skills (written and verbal) 
- Proficient knowledge of Windows and UNIX
- Working knowledge of C/C++, HTML, XML, PERL 
- Experience with automated testing and knowledge of performance testing
(SilkPerformer a plus) 
- Some knowledge of databases (Oracle, mySQL)
