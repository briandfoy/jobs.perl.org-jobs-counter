Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Berkeley Electronic Press (bepress) provides cutting-edge, Web-based
solutions for the academic and scholarly community. We have a number of
products and services, including 36 (and counting) high-quality
peer-reviewed journals, as well as the world's leading hosted institutional
repository service -- "DigitalCommons". Our products are licensed by
institutions around the world, including the University of California,
Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Oxford, the World Bank, and the IMF.

We are a successful fast-growing Berkeley-based company with 35 employees,
a collaborative work environment where technical and non-technical
colleagues work together to create great software, serve our customers and
create the future of academic publishing and scholarly communications
solutions.


We are currently looking for an experienced Web Programmer with substantial
Perl experience. We're looking for someone who has substantial work
experience, but is interested in using that as a foundation to help grow a
small development team (<= 10 people) into a bigger one. You'll be involved
in making architectural decisions, putting new systems and protocols in
place, and in general making bepress a better place.

Your day-to-day activities will involve the following, in no particular
order:

* Provide input on architectural decisions on software (and hardware).
* Mentor more junior programmers, including code review.
* Assist senior programmers/management on scaling both the organizational
and technical infrastructure.
* Code! 

Why should I even think about this job?

* Competitive, market based salary
* Collaborative atmosphere
* Really smart co-workers (no, really!)
* Medical and dental plans included
* Matching IRA plan
* Bicycle friendly

Required skills:

* 5+ years Perl experience
* Experience working on a high volume production website
* Strong Unix skills
* Strong people skills
* Strong non-people skills (i.e. technical)
* Demonstrated history of strong initiative and interest in career
development 
* Experience in LAMP-based production environments. In our case, LAMP
means:
o Linux
o Apache (currently 1.3, but we'll need to upgrade to 2.x someday)
o mod_perl
o Postgres
o CVS


Desired skills:
* Database skills (up to and including DBA level)
