Fast Switch Ltd. is looking for candidates that are excited about
developing Perl applications!  Ideal candidates will have at least two
years of experience in Perl, HTML, and JavaScript (Perl is most
important).  OO experience is a big plus.  Equally important, we are
looking for candidates that will be a good fit for the client and vice
versa.  The client is looking for candidates who are willing to come on
permanently after a period of 6+ months.
