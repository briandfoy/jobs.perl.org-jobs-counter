keep using your brain.

Perl for understanding application code, packaging, building system
management scripts.

Apache (mod_perl would help), MySQL replication, postfix, BIND, general

stranger to iptables).

You speak English as well as Dutch.

Desired skills:
Additionally it would help if you have experience in the field of security.

considered a plus. Any experience with high availability and redundancy
