Job title:
Contract/Freelance Perl Web Developer needed

Company name: Bluebrain Multimedia

Location: Canada, BC, Vancouver

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We have a functioning e-commerce site which needs some security
enhancements, bug fixes and added features. The existing code is poorly
commented but has well named variables so is hopefully not too difficult to
decipher. We need a freelance contractor who can quickly get up to speed
and make improvements.

We're in Canada and don't have an enterprise level budget so it's unlikely
we'll be able to afford to work with a developer who needs to be paid in
GBP or EUR given the exchange rates.

Required skills: PERL on LINUX

Desired skills: PayPal e-commerce integration
