Description:
Large publishing company is looking for software developers to build
dynamic content websites and in-house administrative  / reporting systems.

Required skills:
Significant experience working in a Unix environment (preferably Linux),
strong Perl development skills, with some relational database (Oracle,

secure servers and ecommerce systems is desirable.  A working knowledge of
HTML, XML, and JavaScript is expected. 

Desired skills:
Experience with mod_perl, MySQL, and/or HTML::Mason is a big plus.  This is
a software development position, but other things we’d find nice to have

administration, and any database administration.
In addition to other engineers, you will interact with designers and a
marketing staff to build great online products and reporting tools.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential.
