Job title: Perl Maven

Location: California

Pay rate: Open

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Looking for a backup PERL programmer to learn a complex system, help with
its development and eventually take over when I leave, whether that is by
someone's choice or homicide or too much rap music.

Person must have
exponential moons of experience; be quite adept at creating logical
scripts; be willing to learn a rather intense and large system; know how to
follow directions; not be a thorn or a prick as it were; comprehend
mechanisms and procedures beyond mortal, politically correct, self-aware
living organisms; not be a species parasite or viral infection; be willing
to learn how scripts run, what does what, what flow takes one to what level
of consciousness and be able to retroactively answer any question asked
before it is contemplated. Or something relatively close thereto.

Did I
mention PERL?!?! We're talking expert level here. Json, Rest API, Ajax,
jQuery, LWP, net:FTP, Excel creation and a mighty small amount of Php are
necessary knowledge sets. Awareness of Windows and Unix environments for
PERL execution. Best if close to if not completely at expert level in
running both systems. Kudos and brownie points to those who shine at server
tasks.

I am not looking to go further into insanity in this search so save
the time if you can't justify the reality of your qualifications.
Absolutely NO beginners, wannabees, intern spores or speedo wearing nerds
seeking redemption from life's travails: suck it up buttercup. And the
anticipated exit of myself to turn this over to a trained and ready for
prime-time player is not anticipated soon. Later, but not soon. Define soon
as you will.

To apply, respond to this ad using the nifty email feature
giving who, what, when, why, how and what for; as well as a pitch that
tells me about yourself , your experience and that you know what you're
talking about.

Perl is very much alive and Monks tend to look down at
lowly bottom feeding Php'ers. But not here. Well. OK. Honestly. This is
going to be a running ad until the right person is found. Once applied DO
NOT follow up. You'll be contacted IF you meet the requirements and are
being added to any short list. It only matters where you live if you live
outside of the United States. U.S. residents ONLY! All others will be
discarded.

Thank you for reading and have a peachy day.

Desired skills:
PERL
Json
Rest API
Ajax
jQuery
LWP
net:FTP
Excel creation
Php
