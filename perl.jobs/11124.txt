Job title: Senior Perl Engineer / Online Advertising

Company name: Nami Media

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
	You will be responsible for architecting, implementing and
supporting new and existing products through the entire software lifecycle.
 We’re a small team and everyone wears a lot of hats.  You need the ability
to quickly assess problems, work with internal and external customers and
implement elegant, effective solutions in alignment with business
objectives.
	We hope to have some things to teach you.  Even more, we want you
to have things to teach us.

Company Overview:
Nami Media started business in 2000 as a white label developer of data
management systems for online advertising networks.  Early success led to
evolution of its data management tools into fully developed online
advertising management systems for agencies, brokers, ad networks, and
search marketing businesses.  Nami now supports a broad range of search and
contextual advertising activities for its clients.
 
In late 2008, Nami released a new version of its platform which brings
innovative capabilities to the management of online advertising, including:

•	  Real time certification of the quality of traffic from publishers
working with agencies, ad networks, or other publisher aggregators.  This
allows traffic to be matched to sources of ads in a way that protects
advertisers from low quality traffic or fraudulent clicks while ensuring
maximum revenue potential for publishers
•	  Platform management tools that allow broad and deep access to a
very large pool of keyword-based ads within networks, across networks, and
from Nami relationships with XML feed syndicators.
•	  Ad unit management tools that allow the creation, management,
testing, and optimization of contextual and display ad placement of keyword
driven ads with multiple pricing formats, images, and customizable look and
feel—all using self serve tools supported by access to professional
support.
 
Nami Media is preparing to scale its business substantially from its
current base of established business partners and needs sharp, analytically
minded engineers to support the growth of our mission-critical technology
infrastructure and products.
