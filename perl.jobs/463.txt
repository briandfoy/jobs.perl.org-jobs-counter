Job title:
OOP Perl/DBI/Oracle/mod_perl whitebox tester

Company name: eWingz Systems, Inc.

Internal ID: WB06212002

Location: United States, California, San Francisco

Pay rate: As Experienced

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We're 1 year into development of a system that is OO Perl, mod_perl, DBI
and DBD::Oracle on Linux.

We've spent a lot of energy doing it right and writing tests as we go. This
has given us huge benefits in the life of the project, but our current
whitebox tester has decided to move to Washington, D.C. so we need somebody
to fill his large shoes.


Required skills:
If you're a good Perl programmer who has a strong sense of "the way it
should be" and can be simultaneously mean, nasty, angry, distrustful and
unforgiving to Perl code and the opposite to people then we'd like to talk
to you.


Desired skills:
This person doesn't do new development, per se, but he is responsible for
making things better via testing, fixing, documentation and refactoring.
