Job title: Perl Support Engineer

Company name: Traveltek Ltd.

Internal ID: SDEV5

Location: United Kingdom, Glasgow, East Kilbride

Pay rate: Dependant on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking to add some new people to our already extensive team, and are
on the hunt for a software support engineer who thinks they have what it
takes to join us. Perhaps you're already a Perl expert, or a PHP, Python or
Ruby programmer who is looking for a new challenge. We deal with more code
(3 million lines and counting) and more data (hundreds of millions of rows)
then you've likely come across before, but if that sounds like fun, this is
the place for you.

Some knowledge of Linux or other flavour of UNIX would be a plus, as this
is what our whole platform runs on. Some database experience is definitely
a must, MySQL especially. And as you will dealing with customers and we
pride ourselves on good service, good communication skills are key.
Finally, you'll need a willingness to learn. Almost everything we do is
likely to be new to you, and you should be ready for a challenge.

We provide 24 hour support, so you need to be willing to work both day and
night shifts, typically based in our Head Office in East Kilbride. The
successful candidate will benefit from a competitively based salary.

To apply for this position please email your CV to jobs@traveltek.net.

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL

Desired skills:
Apache
Linux
mod_perl
