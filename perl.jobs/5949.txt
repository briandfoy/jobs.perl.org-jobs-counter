Hi Perl users,

My name is Stanley Go and I am a technical recruiter for the
Google.com<http://google.com/>engineering team at Google.  This is the
most dynamic, challenging, and fun
group at Google.  It is an exciting time at Google and we are always looking
for the very best talent to join us.  In a gist, I am looking for engineers
with Unix Sys Admin and SW background with strong coding skills.

First let me tell you a little about the position.
"Google.com<http://google.com/>engineering team is the "Mission
Control" of Google - the group that ensures
that our critical services and systems meet the availability and performance
standards our users expect.  Google.com <http://google.com/> engineers help
development teams think about, and engineer for, reliability in user-facing
services and systems.  Google.com <http://google.com/> engineers require a
unique combination of software engineering, networking, system
administration, diagnostic ability, and good judgment.  They are called upon
to make instant decisions that have large consequences, and they have to be
very, very good at it!"

I am currently recruiting for two positions (we have both multiple positions
and locations in the US, Europe, and Australia):
Software Engineer, Google.com <http://google.com/> -
http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=23591
Unix System/Applications Administrator, Google.com <http://google.com/> -
http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=23594

We have multiple positions in various locations in the US and Europe.  If
you are open to exploring this opportunity, please send me an email so we
can schedule a time to discuss more details.

I hope you are not bothered by my networking attempt.  If you are not
interested or available, but would like to forward my name and contact
information to your friends or colleagues, I would be most appreciative.

Thank you and hope to hear from you soon!

Best Regards,
