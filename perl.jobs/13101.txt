solving their problems.
- Stay current on the latest technologies and best practices in development
and constantly be looking for ways to improve the quality of the team.
- Be pleasant and/or fun to work with.

Benefits
- 100% employer paid health, dental and vision for you (and reasonable
costs for your qualified dependents)
- Ample paid time off and company holidays

Required skills:
- Looking for solid talent and significant applied experience. 
- Bachelors' degree in related field or equivalent knowledge gained through

and CORS.
