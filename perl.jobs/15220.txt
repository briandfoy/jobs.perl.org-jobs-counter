Job title: Perl modifications to Mailscanner

Company name: Online Marketing Guild LLC

Location: United States

Pay rate: joint venture

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Do you prefer to get a job writing code for an employer?

or

Would you
prefer an opportunity to share in the rewards and help me solve a major
Internet problem that has afflicted hundreds of millions of people for
nearly three decades and share some of the rewards from a new product I
want to launch this month?

If you prefer the safety and security of a
regular paycheck, then read no further, and I wish you all of the best.

But if you are tired of the 9-5 world, and if you are ready for a change in
your life, we should talk. 

Why?

Because I think I've figured out how to
end the problem of email spam. I'm talking about a 99.9% spamless solution,
with an eye toward raising that figure to 100% over time.

What I lack is
the technical know-how to make the programming modifications needed to make
it happen.

If you're interested in talking with me about this, please
contact me.

Desired skills:
Must be strong in Perl.

Mailscanner experience desirable but not required.
