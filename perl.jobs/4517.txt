Job title: Interactive Software Engineer

Company name: BBC

Internal ID: 81479

Location: United Kingdom, UK, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 12-month contract

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
BBC Interactive Drama and Entertainment are looking for a new member of the
software engineering team. You’ll be responsible for helping to deliver the
next generation of interactive applications for the web and increasingly
mobile platforms. You’ll be working amongst site producers, client side
developers and graphic designers in the department whose output includes
Eastenders, Celebdaq, Doctor Who and Jamie Kane.


Required skills:
We primarily develop in Perl on Unix systems and so you’ll be comfortable
with these as well as MySQL and/or Oracle databases and the Apache web
server. The software we create needs to serve large audiences and so good
engineering practices and an eye for quality are vital. We also build
software for internal use to support content production and run our own
development server.

Applications to be received by 30 June.
