Job title: Web engineer and performance tools automation

Company name: NTT DATA

Internal ID: 12-02685

Location: Princeton, NJ or Halifax, NS

Pay rate: open

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have a number of vendor-supplied performance tools in our portfolio (eg.
Optier Corefirst, Splunk, Coradiant Truesight) which we have a need to
better integrate with our existing, proprietary configuration management
and provisioning systems. Our ultimate aim is to derive more value from
these technologies by making them easier to use and more reliable through
automating processes that are either manually performed today, or not
performed at all.

 

The role primarily involves programming/scripting, though will also involve
some interaction with global operations teams (in locations including
Canada and India) that will ultimately provide support and coverage for the
tools developed, and the underlying products for which those tools are
built. The technical skills that we are looking for are primarily
experience with Perl, but also other programming languages, XML and
distributed systems. The ability to work in a team (including cross
regional) and the ability to build relationships with customers is a must,
as is the ability to establish process for operations teams will be
necessary as well providing best practices for the production environment.

Required skills:
3 years experience in Perl Scripting and XML
1 year of Linux Administration
3 years of OO Perl
1 year of testing methodologies


Good knowledge of Perl:
object-oriented techniques and how to write/use classes
debugging techniques
testing strategies & supporting modules
familiarity with other common modules used to handle templating, XML
parsing and interaction with relational databases
Working knowledge of Linux

Desired skills:
Web technologies including the HTTP protocol, RESTful web services and the
Apache webserver
Relational databases (ideally Sybase or DB2, but experience with others is
OK)
Private Key Infrastructure/SSL
Source code control (ideally GIT, but experience with other tools is OK)
Infrastructure lifecycle (installation, configuration, deployment,
patching, upgrade, and uninstallation)
