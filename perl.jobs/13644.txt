Job title: Web Developer

Company name: s1

Internal ID: JJ-473

Location: Glasgow, UK

Pay rate: £ depends on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you pride yourself on writing great web server code then s1 would like
to talk to you. We are looking for someone who:

Is an expert in scripting open-source environments, using languages like
PHP, Perl and Python to create high-performance web services which are
built to last. 
Knows databases, especially MySQL, enough to be fluent in SQL and
experienced in query optimisation and table architectures.
Is experienced with Apache and modules like mod_rewrite. 
Is comfortable at the Linux command prompt and has at least some experience
with SSH.
In addition to those backend skills, familiarity with front-end
technologies like HTML5, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax and JSON is expected,
while exposure to any of mod_perl, memcached, e-commerce, development for
mobile devices, version control systems or multiple-server environments
would be helpful.

If you don't have experience with all of these then don't worry too much --
most important is your approach to your work, your professionalism and your
willingness to learn. Essential to this role is a cooperative attitude and
your ability & willingness to work with teams of technical and
non-technical colleagues.

In return we can offer you a permanent, secure position working on
Scotland's foremost digital brands, in a great Glasgow city centre
location, where every day you will be able to make a difference on
high-profile websites with hundreds of thousands of users. You will be a
key part of a small but diverse in-house technical team, alongside UI
designers, front-end developers and other back-end developers, and will be
working closely with our in-house marketing, sales and customer service
teams to deliver excellence for both users and clients.
