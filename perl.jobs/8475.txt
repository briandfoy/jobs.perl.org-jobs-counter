Job title:
Software Engineer, Future Media & Technology

Internal ID: 435946

Location: United Kingdom, West London

Pay rate: £34 - £40k

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Future Media & Technology is responsible for maintaining and supporting the
applications and services that make up the award-winning bbc.co.uk website.


Working with dedicated teams producing and supporting high quality software
systems, your role will involve writing and testing software code to
pre-determined technical specifications. You’ll contribute to the technical
planning of software projects, helping to estimate timescales and resources
required to successfully deliver the final product. And, more specifically,

Required skills:
In order to do this, you’ll need a good level of knowledge with regards to
the software development lifecycle and associated processes. A track record
developing large scale internet-based applications and production systems
will stand you in good stead, as will significant web development
experience using Perl (preferably mod_perl), Apache modules, XML, HTML,
Unix and SQL databases.
