Description:
AIMS OF THE JOB
To develop, manage and document high quality components for interactive web
sites, data processing pipelines and a content production framework.

To contribute to the provision of a content production and software
development infrastructure.

To support the Software Engineering Team Leader in ensuring that Learning &
Interactive makes the best use of available technology in the planning,
preparation and presentation of its internet site and related media.

To contribute to the long-term development and sharing of skills within the
Software Engineering team.

To communicate technical information to the rest of the department in a
concise and understandable manner.

ORGANISATION
Reports to the Software Engineering Team Leader, Learning & Interactive. 

All team members perform a core software development role; systems and
database administration and user documentation duties are distributed
amongst members of the team.

CONTEXT
The Software Engineers together with the Webmasters, Client-side Developers
and Technical Project Managers form a technical team working alongside the
graphic designers and content producers.

Learning & Interactive seeks to be at the forefront of internet and
interactive TV developments. This is an area where the future direction of
technology is not always clear and therefore it is essential that the
department keeps itself up-to-date and is constantly seeking the best ways
to deliver its services.

The Learning & Interactive technical teams provide the infrastructure for
Interactive F&L output (in particular the department’s increasing need for
content production and management) and also pilot new approaches and
contribute components to other parts of the BBC.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
Core Role:
1. To develop perl scripts and modules in a unix environment using tools
such as cvs and make.

2. To create highly scalable and secure interactive Web components and
applications using CGI, mod_perl, SQL etc.

3. To develop a content production framework for Learning & Interactive
using XML and relational database technologies on a mixture of Windows and
Unix platforms.

4. To contribute to the development of a toolkit of reusable components.

5. To document all modules and scripts for a technical audience.

6. To maintain and improve software components using organisational tools
such as cvs, wiki and MS Outlook.

7. To contribute to improvement of the software development cycle.

8. To keep abreast of new developments and develop expertise in scripting
and programming languages, databases, data exchange protocols, internet
standards and share knowledge with the Software Engineering and other
technical teams.

9. To represent Learning & Interactive on technical issues within the wider
BBC.

10. To be self-organised and work effectively in a team as well as
individually.

11. To advise the Software Development Team Leader and others on resources
and time scales associated with projects.

Plus some of the following (the full range of these responsibilities will
be spread through the technical team so individuals will not be expected to
cover all of these):

1. To administer Unix development and content production servers.

2. To maintain departmental databases.

3. To write documentation of applications and components for an audience
with a wide range of technical knowledge.

4. To manage the library of source code, documentation and other associated
resources.

5. To assist in monitoring and provision of statistics for technical teams.


6. To advise Technical Project Managers working with external developers in
ensuring interactive applications they supply are to the technical
specifications provided.


Required skills:
