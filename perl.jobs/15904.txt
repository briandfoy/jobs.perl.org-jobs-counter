Job title: Perl API Developer

Company name: ClickMagick, Inc

Location: Austin, TX, United States

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
1,000s of paying customers rely on ClickMagick to track, manage and
optimize all of their online advertising.

We are looking to add a fourth
technical member to our team. Everybody telecommutes and it is a relaxed
environment.

We offer a competitive starting salary, equity, the freedom
to work when and where you want, no corporate BS or politics, and a great
team on a mission. 

Starting salary negotiable depending on skills and
experience.

Our stack is Perl + CentOS + Apache (legacy) + Nginx + MySQL +
jquery + Angular V1 + Git. You don't need to know all of them, but the more
you know, the better. You must have Perl experience. We have many tens of
thousands of lines of Perl code for you to feast upon.

The main services
we use are  Github + Trello + Slack + CloudFront. Experience with some of
these is a big plus.

Desired skills:
We are looking for somebody that is very comfortable with Perl and willing
to use the latest hotness in new code while maintaining legacy code. We
have older code using mod_perl on Apache and newer code using Plack+nginx
and OpenResty with some Lua. Familiarity with nginx or Plack is a big plus.

Being a CPAN author is also a big plus.

We need someone with API
integration experience. In this position, you will be integrating our
system with the Facebook Ad API, Google Adsense API, Bing Ad API, and many
more. We need someone that eats, breaths and sleeps with APIs on their
mind. If this is you, hit us up.
