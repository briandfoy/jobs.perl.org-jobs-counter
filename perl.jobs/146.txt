Have you got any work you would like done without the risk
of the cost blowing out. If so, i can provide you with a 
fixed project cost (based on specs/description by you). 

I specialise in the following technologies.

* Perl
* Apache
* MySQL
* Postgresql
* HTML
* XML
* Unix (Sloaris, Linux)

Within Perl in particular i have worked extensively in the following areas:

* Network Programming
* Shopping Carts
* Cookie related programming
* SysAdmin Programming
* Parsing
* Databases/DBI/DBD
* Forms
* CGI
* Robots / WebCrawlers
* Search Engines
* Autoresponders
* Surveys
* Polls


If you have projects you would like to get done in any/all of the above
technolgies, i would be most obliged to be given the opportunity to provide
a fixed price quote (and hopefully getting the work thereafter).

You can also be assured of the quality of work, as i can provide references
of relavant work (to the projects as they come along) and you can also view
code samples of my work on CPAN. My resume is also available upon request. 

kind regards,

simran.
