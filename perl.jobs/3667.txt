Job title: Perl/Mason/Oracle (part-time contract)

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £10/hour

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 2 months

Onsite: no

Description:
To start with my requirements are very simple.	I need to make a few
queries to an oracle database to populate 2 drop-down boxes. Depending on
the user's selection a third drop-down box will be populated from the
database.

This is the first requirement but the project will grow larger and more
complex (oop).

To begi with there'll be a few hours here and there, not huge amounts but
it will gradually increase.  So it would be good for someone who already is
working full-time but can handle a few extra hours.

All using Perl and Mason.

Required skills:
OOP Perl and Mason as well as Oracle.
Good English.
