“UK house prices rise at fastest for a year as London market rebounds.”

Buying, selling, renting or leasing, everyone is effected by property in
some way. A leading, Digital Property Platform and app that has
revolutionised the way people rent, lease and buy property are still
enjoying continuous growth as they dominate this market. And they are
looking for an experienced Perl Developer to continue to help them do so

The Perl Developer will share a passion for tech, digital platforms and the
property market. You will build new features and enhancements to the
platform including the APIs that drive our website, back-end tools,
intensive/distributed data processing, search technology, complex valuation
algorithms, and server control functionality. 

As an experienced Perl
