Job title: Remote developer half time

Pay rate: $1000/mo

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
I am looking for a developer willing to work remotely on a project. It has
a complex code base and needs someone who can learn the existing code and
take it over on an ongoing basis.

The project requires knowledge of Class::DBI & Moose frameworks.  For a
good programmer, it should not take more than a few days to master both.
However, your knowledge of perl needs to be good enough to be able to
figure it out. 

Hours are completely flexible and the only requirement is results

This project is ideal for an overseas developer. I speak Russian and do not
mind time difference.

Required skills:
Perl, OOPerl
Any ORM, such as Class::DBI, DBIx::Class, Rose::DB, etc
mysql


Desired skills:
Moose
Class::DBI
