How often does an opportunity come along to build a product that will end

At AirG, we develop mobile communities and wireless social networking
products that resonate with the hip and trend defining 18 – 30 demographic.
We’re working with industry leaders such as Bell Canada, Verizon, Sprint
Nextel, Cingular and T-Mobile to define an entirely new way of interacting
on your mobile phone. In our ideally situated office on fashionable Robson
Street in Vancouver, we’re creating products that enable millions of
customers to experience a sense of being connected.  Wirelessly.

AirG has the fastest growing social network on mobile phones with more than

A solution-oriented and pragmatic developer, you learned the tricks of your
trade in a software development environment that employed standardized
methodologies and scripting languages such as Perl.  You have also

PERL/PHP) and consider yourself to be a whiz at bringing new applications
to life.

We work in a carrier grade, high uptime, secure and optimized web
environment that will enable you to use all of your skills to develop
mobile applications and dynamic interfaces, design databases and manage
schema/data.  You will work closely with internal and external clients so
having strong communication and interpersonal skills is a must.

You have at least 3 years’ experience in developing and integrating
software (preferably for a wireless solutions developer) and a
post-secondary education in computing science or engineering, or an
equivalent combination of experience and education.

In addition to having a flexible and relaxed work environment, we believe
