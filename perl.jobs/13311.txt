Job title: Perl Engineer

Company name: Shutterstock

Location: Austin, TX

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Headquartered in New York, Shutterstock is a technology company that
connects stock media buyers and sellers. Our mission is to provide the best
stock content buying and selling experience anywhere. We get to build a lot
of really cool systems at scale, including search, download, content
organization, real-time metrics, deployment, and other stuff that we can't
tell you about yet. Our current systems are mostly built around Perl,
Javascript, PHP, Ruby, Solr, Apache, Nginx, and MySQL. Our open source
projects can be found at code.shutterstock.com. 
Shutterstock is seeking experienced and intelligent software engineers that
are excited about working with other experienced and intelligent software
engineers on closely integrated teams to push the boundaries of what is
expected of a stock photo company. We focus on fast, iterative development
(over 150 deployments/month) and collaborative, interactive programming.
Developers work on small cross-functional teams (4-6 people) that have a
voice in setting their own priorities and are expected to build and deploy
applications quickly and iteratively. 

Qualified candidates are: 

In love with programming and building things that have never existed 
Curious and passionate about finding creative solutions to complex problems

Able communicators that are used to talking through problems and feel a
deep need to share the cool stuff that they're working on with others 
Experienced enough to know what to build themselves and what not to 
Aware of what they don't know yet and are excited about what to learn next 

Ready to teach us some new tricks 
Able to take care of business

Required skills:
A very deep understanding of at least one programming language (Perl
strongly preferred, but we're not zealots) 
Years of experience with at least one database (MySQL preferably) 
A profound knowledge of how the web works and how to make it efficient
(HTTP, caching, page rendering, etc) 
Strong linux experience.

Desired skills:
HTML::Mason 
Experience with web MVC frameworks: Dancer, Mojolicious, Catalyst, Sinatra,
Express, etc 
RESTful API design and development 
Layout / Design 
Front or back end javascript / Node.js 
Image processing and computer vision 
MongoDB or other key/value stores 
Memcached / Redis 
System administration 
MogileFS
