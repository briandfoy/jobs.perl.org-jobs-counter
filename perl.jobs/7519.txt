Location: United Kingdom, Bristol

Pay rate: highly competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) is looking for talented Software
Engineers/Architects to develop and expand our next-generation data
management systems.

We're looking for someone who loves working with the complex interactions
of large systems -- who enjoys optimising architecture for performance and
scalability and capably grapples with competing priorities and demands.
Candidates must be experienced, creative, flexible and self-motivated, with
a natural flair for designing and writing reliable, maintainable code.

This is a telecommuting position joining our extensive team in the Bristol
area, all of whom work from home. The successful candidate will need to
relocate to the Bristol area to be able to attend a weekly working lunch
and other meetings with colleagues.  You would be provided with the
necessary equipment and a fast broadband connection.

IMDb is the biggest, best, most award-winning movie site on the planet. It
is currently the #17 most popular site in the U.S. and #31 world-wide
(source: Alexa.com, Sep 2007). You would be joining a growing, cutting-edge
company with excellent prospects. Our salaries are extremely competitive,
and we also offer a top-notch benefits package courtesy of our parent
company, Amazon.co.uk.

Skills required:
    * Candidates should have experience of working with enterprise
architectures and large database-driven applications.
    * Candidates should have an extremely high level of competence in Perl,
Java, C++ or similar, be experienced in Object Oriented Design/OOP and be
comfortable working and programming in a UNIX/Linux environment. For
candidates without intimate Perl experience, we will be looking for
evidence of adaptability and experience in a related language (e.g.
shell-scripting, PHP, sed, awk).
  * Solid communication skills and the ability to work well in a team are
critical.
  * We'll be looking for evidence of excellent API design and architecture
skills, and an up-to-date understanding of current best-practises in
enterprise architecture.
  * A computer science degree or equivalent is required, along with
industry programming experience.
  * Experience of SQL, unit testing and web services would count in your
favour, as would relevant advanced competencies like distributed systems,
machine intelligence, data mining, expert systems, natural language
processing etc.

IMDb.com is an equal opportunities employer.  We believe passionately that
employing a diverse workforce is central to our success. We make recruiting
decisions based on your experience and skills. We value your passion to
discover, invent, simplify and build.  We welcome applications from all
members of society irrespective of age, sex, disability, sexual
orientation, race, religion or belief.

OOP, enterprise architecture, Linux/UNIX
