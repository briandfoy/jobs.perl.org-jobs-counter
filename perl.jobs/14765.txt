Job title: Senior Full Stack LAMP Developer - Perl

Company name: Goldstar Learning

Internal ID: GSLSNRDEVPERL

Location: Chicago, IL

Pay rate: Market U$D

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
These are exciting times at Goldstar Learning. We've been an innovator and
leader in the EdTech space for over 10 years. To accommodate our rapid
growth, we will be moving our headquarters to a new office in downtown
Chicago's Tech Hub (River North)--near the Merchandise Mart.

Our software platform has served us well, and we want to take it to the
next level. That's where you and the rest of the Dev Team come in.

As a Full Stack Engineer, you will be working in an Agile/Scrum
environment. Our LAMP stack includes Linux, Perl, Ruby, and PostgreSQL.
You'll work with a solid team of peers to keep our current code base in
shape and build new features for our loyal client base. While you are at
it, help us get the ball rolling on building the next version of our
flagship product. This is your chance to contribute what you know (A strong
knowledge of OO Perl is essential) and learn how to get things done using
whatever technology is optimal.  

The ideal candidate will have an established background building web-based
solutions, offer great communication skills, and demonstrate an ability to
deliver in a fast-paced environment. You thrive on tackling difficult
problems; have great troubleshooting abilities and years of hands-on
software development skills. You keep abreast of the latest technology
developments and think outside the box. As a Senior Engineer, you
demonstrate strong leadership characteristics and a track record of
delivering great solutions.

Required skills:
Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent.
Advanced development experience with a solid understanding of the full
software development stack
Demonstrated experience with modern object-oriented programming and testing
methodologies.
Effective problem-solving skills with the ability to support, diagnose and
resolve issues in a production environment.
Familiar with a source code repository, ideally Git and project tracking
tools like JIRA
Operate efficiently and effectively with a minimum of oversight.

Desired skills:
8+ years software development experience.
2+ years of senior experience.
(We will consider candidates with less experience if you can demonstrate
your abilities and effective experience.)
Linux Admin Experience a plus

We offer a competitive salary based on experience along with a
comprehensive benefits package that includes 401K, Health, Dental,
Disability and Life Insurance.

Relocation assistance is an option we would take into consideration.

Only US Citizen or Green Card Holder (No Sponsorship) need apply.
