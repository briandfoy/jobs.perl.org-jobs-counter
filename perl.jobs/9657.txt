Job title: Community Platform Developer

Company name: getPraised

Location: Germany, Hamburg

Travel: 0-25%

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
getPraised is a new and unique community platform. Your job is to continue
the development and administration of the platform and the administration
development system. One of the first tasks will be to set up and modify a
new instance of the platform for a new target audience.

Required skills:
You know Perl, of course. You know Perl's OOP, closures, references,
hashes, and operator overloading. You see the taint mode as the only way to
run a program exposed to the internet. You know why input validation is
important and how it's done right.

You know DBI, Rose::DB::Object, Template::Toolkit and the other major Perl
Modules, and you have used them often in your own projects.

You can install, administrate, and use PostgreSQL, Slackware Linux, Apache
Webserver, and Subversion on your own, without someone holding your hand.

You are a native german speaker, or at least are able to speak german like
a native speaker. And you are able to communicate in written english.

You are fluent in HTML 4, basic CSS, and Javascript. You naturally create
valid, semantic HTML without layout tables and without div soup, and style
it using valid, semantic CSS. Your pages work perfectly without Javascript,
but your Javascript can greatly enhance them.

Desired skills:
It would be nice if you have some graphics skills, sufficient to create a
design prototype in GIMP or Photoshop, and to create some supporting
graphic files for the platform.
