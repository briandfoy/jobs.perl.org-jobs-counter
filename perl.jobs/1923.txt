Company name: NextEd Pty Ltd.

Location: Australia, New South Wales, Sydney

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
NextEd is an online education infrastructure company that partners with
universities and institutes to market and deliver their courses over the
Internet to students and organisations based in Asia.

We have developed an innovative OO Perl-based online education and business
management application and require help to develop it further.	

We'd like to explore working with one or more independent contractors in
the Sydney area over a period of up to a year.	Since the collapse of
Sydney Perl Mongers, we are uncertain how big the Perl community is here. 
If you are an individual or small Perl-based development company, we'd be
interested to hear from you whether or not you are immediately available. 
You must be resident in Australia with rights to work here.

Required skills:
OO programming, internet technologies, experience in Perl and HTML
programming.

Desired skills:
CGI::FormBuilder, HTML::Template

IIS, Apache.

CVS

Basic Windows and Linux system administration.
