Job title: Perl Dev/Project Manager

Company name: Perl Hunter

Pay rate: up to $50/hour

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 1+ years

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
The PerlHunter has a great opening for a senior Perl developer with
project management skills. My client has several Perl projects (under
individual contractors) going which need oversight from a skilled
manager. You would also be coding Perl for these projects and possibly
new ones. I placed one of the contractors there and he is skilled so you
won't be managing newbies. The projects involve web and DB stuff and you
will learn more from my client. The client is in Los Angeles and there
may be some travel there to meet with them.


Required skills:
Very solid Perl
Project management experience
Telecommute experience (self starter)
