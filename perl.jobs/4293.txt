Job title:
Wanted Perl, Python MySql programmer with a passion for documentary films

Company name: e screening room

Location: United States, ca, San Rafael

Pay rate: zip

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3 mnds

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
This is not for the faint of heart ! If you have time to hammer this out in
the next three weeks let us know… We will be building an integration of
“Broadcast Machine” with Paypal subscription services.* 

We are looking for a volunteer web developer with a passion for documentary
films and in support of the freedom of speech, with experience with perl,
Python mysql. We are using agile (extreme) programming methods. We can’t
pay you anything but you get to create the cool feature to support the
freedom of speech. 

The none-profit e screening room  http://escreeningroom.org/ is dedicated
to connect independent documentary film makers with their audience. We have
on-line website dedicated to viewing unabridged independent documentary
films at http://escreeningroom.org. 
We are starting a new website http://indiewebfest.org which will be an
online filmfestival based running on open source “Broadcast Machine” from
http://www.getdemocracy.com/broadcast/. The neat thing of the “Broadcast
Machine” is that it is bittorrent based, and thus allows for unlimited band
wide without significant funding. In effect this means that you don’t have
to come up with thousands of $$ to distribute your idea or you film. 

Independent documentary films are born out of the passion –often compassion
- for the subject of the film. Often these documentaries are self financed.
 But there is little financial gain out of documentary film. As a result,
documentary producers get discouraged and often leave the field. We think
that’s a shame: to lose an independent voice, is a loss for a free society.
At the e screening room we are changing that by connecting documentary
filmmakers with their audience. 

PROJECT:
The idea is to allow viewers to subscribe to a site through paypal. The
viewer would pay a low monthly fee to get assess to a subset (subscription
only) of the films on the site. The subscription fees are then
redistributed to the filmmakers papal accounts based on viewer ship and
will fund the site. This project will take place independent of
getdemocracy.com but application will be released as open source. *We have
no format relationship with getdemocracy or its parent participatoryculture


To apply send us 
1) Why you are interested in documentary films.
2) At least one link to a website that shows you skills and explain what
part you created. 
3) At least two references. 
4) Your contact info. 

This is a voluntary position, but for a cool site. 

* We have no formal relationship with getdemocracy or its parent
participatoryculture. 


Required skills: perl, Python mysql
