Job title:
Perl Developer for real-time news company

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permenant

Description:
Wall Street Source is searching for Developers with a background in
database-driven applications who will play an important role in the
continued expansion of our real-time information services.

We're looking for well-rounded developers with anywhere from 2-6 years
(Junior - Mid) of Perl development experience.	If your development
workstation runs Linux, that's a plus.	If you've ever contributed to
anything on CPAN, that's also a plus.

Most importantly, we're looking for people up for a challenge.	We have a
number of big, exciting projects ahead, and we're looking for developers
who can think big.  

This is very much a development position.  Design/architect experience is
helpful, but we are not looking for managers at this time.

Required skills:
* Perl, especially experience with OO Perl.
* A BS in computer science or relevant programming experience.
* Linux, MySQL, experience developing applications and running systems in a
networked environment.
* Strong written and interpersonal skills.


Desired skills:
* Experience working with high-traffic websites or large datasets/loads.
* Experience with test-driven development.
* Experience with the principals of search engine technology, or experience
with commercial search engines (e.g. Verity, Endeca, FAST).
* Experience with messaging systems (Tibco, TAO/ACE, ActiveMQ, etc)
* Experience with commercial news feeds (DowJones, Reuters, etc).
* Flash and the Flash Media Server
* Experience with development in C, C++ or Java is a plus, but not
required.
