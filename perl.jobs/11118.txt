Job title: Email Parser for Abuse

Company name: Quonix Networks

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Pay rate: Please Quote

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 week

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are a large datacenter ISP and are having difficulty with routing of
abuse reports to our customers. This is mainly for abuse reports from
Spamcop.org. Spamcop does not send abuse reports directly to the end users
ARIN-assigned abuse contacted, instead they send it to the parent Netblock
owner, which is us. Right now we manually sort through the reports, and
forward them by hand. We want to automate this process.

All incoming email to our abuse email address will be piped to this soon to
be created Perl script, and it will be handled as follows: 

- If the email is not from Spamcop, then simply deliver it to us, then
exit.

- If the email is from Spamcop, then parse the subject line to grab the IP
or URL of the offender. If its a URL, then you need to resolve the IP. With
the IP, lookup the abuse contact email using Arin's website or a local TXT
database they we will create (CIDR syntax) and deliver the original email
to that address, then exit.

Based on this description, please provide a flat project fee for the
creation of this script.


Required skills:
Skilled in Perl and basic email header handling and delivery. Also would
help to be somewhat familiar with ARIN whois records and IP assignments in
Arin's database.
