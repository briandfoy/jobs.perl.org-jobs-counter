Description:
We recently finished the beta version of our new service called
PeopleSeePeople.

PeopleSeePeople is about first impressions. The basic functionality of the
service is to rate other people’s pictures and to have your picture rated
by other people – NOT in a ‘Hot or Not’ kind of way but on a deeper level
where the results really benefit you. The code is written in Perl.

The service will be launch-ready by June 15.

We are looking for an experienced Perl programmer and system administrator
who can launch the service together with our current programmer and fully
take over from our current programmer by July 4th.

Required skills:
1) Sysadmin

Extensive sysadmin experience in:

- bind
- postfix
- amavis
- postgresl
- slony1
- xen

2) HTML

Within these browsers:

- ie8, ie9 , ff3.6 ff10, chrome (latest version), safari (latest version)

have extensive experience at these things:

- designing pixel-precise rounded boxes with shadows
- design floating popups
- ajax
- javascript / dom manipulation


 3) Perl

At least 5 years of experience with Perl programming.

Desired skills: Experience with XML::LibXML is an advantage.
