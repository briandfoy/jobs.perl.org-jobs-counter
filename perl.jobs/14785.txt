Location: London, England

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 months

Hours: Full time

Description:
We're looking for a talented Senior Perl Developer to join our team as we
take on an ambitious project to scale our core products and migrate out of
our physical data centres into an AWS based infrastructure. The successful
candidate will focus on automating unit, functional and performance tests
to ensure system stability and an efficient provisioning process while

our award winning software. We also track approximately 9 million job
applications across 65 countries a month. But we want to do more.

We're a small company (90 people in the UK), owned by a very big company
(CareerBuilder), and a great place to work. We've got a development team of
30 and are fully committed to Perl, clearing our technical debt, and doing
things the right way moving forward.

Required skills:
•	Strong object-oriented Perl programming skills
•	Experience in continuous integration (CI) implementation and
practices with a focus on automated testing of deployment and provisioning
code
•	Excellent communication skills and ability to discuss technical
issues with people from a non-technical background 
•	Good problem solving skills and ability to work within in a team
and autonomously 
•	Ability to work well under pressure, while retaining focus and
composure
•	Attention to detail and managing delivery to stringent time scales
•	Knowledge of web technologies
