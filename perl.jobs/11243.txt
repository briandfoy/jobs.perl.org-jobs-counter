Job title: Experienced mod_perl programmer for ThinkGeek

Company name: ThinkGeek

Location: United States, VA, Fairfax

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for a prolific Perl coding wizard to join our crack team of
code monkey ninjas. You'll sling Perl, SQL, and JQuery while getting to
play with cool new ThinkGeek swag long before it appears on Engadget or
Gizmodo. 

Our software is developed in-house, so projects will run a wide gamut of
business areas (accounting to warehouse management, and everything in
between). Development will be on an existing suite of software, so the
ability to adapt to and extend an existing architecture is a must.
Responsibilities will include: web/console/batch based application
development, maintaining and configuring development servers, participation
in requirements and specifications gathering processes, software quality
assurance and internal documentation. The ideal candidate should have
strong Linux skills and be able to work and learn new skills independently
when necessary, but also work as part of a team.

ThinkGeek is a small, close-knit group of fun, weird, and enthusiastic
people who run one of the most successful niche e-commerce sites on the
Internets. As part of Geeknet, Inc, a publicly held company, ThinkGeek
employees receive an excellent benefits package while enjoying the benefits
of working in an exciting start-up environment in our Fairfax, Virginia
office. This posting is for a permanent, full time position in our Fairfax,
Virginia office. Only local applicants or those willing to relocate at
their own expense will be considered.  

Required skills:
* 5+ years professional programming experience with Perl 5
* 4+ years professional experience working with databases (SQL), MySQL a
plus
* Extensive knowledge of Apache and familiarity with Apache module
development
* XML
* HTML/XHTML
* Javascript/AJAX
* Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in an
exacting manner
* Team-oriented personality
* Ability to blow away all other ThinkGeek departments when brainstorming
April Fool's Day ideas

Desired skills:
* Experience developing automated functional and performance testing suites

* Solid Linux Knowledge (4+ years of experience with Linux or Unix systems)

* Retail industry software development experience
* Web Services development (servers/clients)
* Nerf weaponry expertise
