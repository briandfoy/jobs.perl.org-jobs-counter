Job title:
Systems Administrator - Fun company, great team

Company name: GridApp Systems, Inc.

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
GridApp Systems is looking for a really sharp system administrator who will
be part of our team working on our database automation software. Use your
talents to help us build an infrastructure, a software suite, and a company
that we can all be proud of. 

GridApp Systems is a rapidly growing company and innovator in the database
management space. We’re located in the heart of Manhattan, right next to
the Flatiron building, near Madison Square park, in a penthouse office with
panoramic views of the city skyline. We hire bright people, we encourage
them to think for themselves, and we enjoy working together. 

This is a great opportunity to work with the sometimes complicated, often
expensive, but always interesting infrastructure toys that big banks have,
without the hassle of actually having to work for a giant company. In our
infrastructure, you will get a chance to work with enterprise technologies
like VMWare, Veritas, Oracle, NetApp, iSCSI, Fibre Channel, and a whole
list of operating systems, from AIX to Z/OS. Most emerging companies don’t
have these things, but our customer is often the large company we are not,
and we use this infrastructure to develop and test our product (and we do
it mostly during business hours). 

The person in this position will be primarily responsible for planning,
designing, managing, and growing this infrastructure. While you may not
know all of the technologies we work with, you will be responsible for
figuring out the best way to manage and maintain them over time.That
includes identifying needs, purchasing new assets, and figuring out how to
get the most out of the assets we already have. If you are interested in
working with new server, storage, network, and infrastructure technologies,
learning as you go, solving problems in real-time, and planning for the
future, this is the job for you. 

We offer a competitive base salary (depending on experience) and a complete
benefits package including stock options, and relocation allowances for
stellar candidates
