Job title: Stunt Double/tight deadline Web project

Company name: Contract job

Internal ID: 0xdeadbeef

Pay rate: Hourly, negiotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need a stunt double -- someone to work with me on this project who will
do the yucky bits that I don't want to do, and will pick up the slack a bit
when I get distracted by something shiny. This is telecommute. A well-known
company hired a client of mine who is passing the work to me. I'd love to
name the end client, but I'm sure they have no idea how far out this work
is being farmed. They have a groody site that's a mixture of Flash,
outbounds links to external service providers, and Personal HomePage
applications being completely misused. They want all of that moved
in-house... by April. They made a major deal with a TV network and then
their board of directors talked about it for 11 months, so now we have one
month. We have hosting set up on a Linux machine (I prefer BSD, but what
can ya do). I'm going to take the architectural lead on the core features,
but I'm happy to listen to reason, and I'll delegate parts out. The bulk of
the request is just a lot of CRUD style admin action to make things dynamic
and easily maintained by the suits, but the list of desired features is as
long as my arm. Right now, I'm just assuming they aren't going to happen,
but maybe we can do a little more damage than I thought.

Required skills:
Perl. Unix. More Perl. Perl, Perl, Perl. CGI. SQL. CVS. IRC. No Perl. Ha!
Just kidding. Perl. 

Desired skills:
My code contains closures. If you don't understand closures, you won't be
able to understand my code. This probably goes for a few other language
constructs. If you happen to know Maypole or Catalyst cold and you want to
try to sell me on them, we can talk.
