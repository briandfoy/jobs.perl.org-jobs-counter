Description:
I am hiring an entry-level Perl developer to create tools that automate the
analysis of advertising campaigns on Google, Yahoo and MSN search.

Sample tasks include:

The ideal candidate is a recent computer science grad with some exposure to
Perl.  Raw programming skill and a good attitude are the most important
qualifications; the right person can pick up the finer points of Perl on
the job.

Benefits include stock options, a lot of autonomy in making design
decisions, and working for a tech savvy manager (I used to hack Perl but
don’t have the time any more).

If you would like to know more, please email me with a bit about yourself
and I’ll be happy to share a detailed job description and set up a time to
speak further.	No recruiters please.

Required skills:
- Perl
- SQL

Desired skills:
- Autonomous.  Able to decide issues of product design, select the
appropriate technologies, and implement the solution.
- Analytical with good problem solving skills.
- Interest in online advertising and commerce.
