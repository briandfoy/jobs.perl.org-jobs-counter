Job title:
Hands-on OO Perl Developers - Commercial Software Development

Company name: GridApp Systems

Location: United States, NY, NewYork

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
***WE WILL RELO WITHIN NORTH AMERICA AND WE WILL SPONSOR***

GridApp Systems is a leader in database automation and management. Our
Clarity™ software provides companies with the ability to simplify and
manage critical database operational tasks such as deployment, patch
management, auditing, and replication across the enterprise.

We are privately held and headquartered in New York City. Located in the
Flatiron District of New York, easily accessible from many directions, we
are transforming the way organizations manage their database infrastructure
through the use of automation.

The culture is inquisitive, collaborative, energized, and highly programmer
casual. This is what you're looking for, right?

Looking to three more very experienced OO Perl developers to focus on
severely complex backend object-oriented Perl development in Linux/Unix
(many flavors). Client side is OO PHP, Perl, JavaScript, SOAP, AJAX, Flash,
dojo, etc.

Oldest version of Perl supported is 5.8.7 (although we might migrate to
5.10 on all supported platforms once it is burned in).

As Open Source fans, we’ve incorporated many CPAN modules (is your’s here?)
including:

Algorithm-C3-0.06

Carp-Clan-5.8

XML-LibXSLT-1.62
XML-NamespaceSupport-1.09
XML-SAX-0.14
XML-Simple-2.16
XML-Xerces-2.7.0-0

As far as coding conventions, we use PBP and peer review (use strict; and
use warnings; are mandatory). Warnings are fatal (causing a die to occur).
All code must compile on all supported platforms prior to commit (Linux,
Solaris, Win32, HP-UX, AIX, others).

Required skills:
* Current hands-on experience in OO PERL with emphasis on multithreading,
multitasking, and TCP/IP networking and/or distributed systems programming

* DATABASE experience with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL

* FLUENCY in Linux (flavors of UNIX – Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, etc. - receive
bonus points)

* If you have TEAM LEAD experience in addition to the above, you'll receive
bonus points...lots of them

Desired skills:
Simply, an unbridled love of coding – especially using Perl.
