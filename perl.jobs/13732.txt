Job title: Senior Software Engineer, Bugzilla

Company name: Mozilla

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
The Automation & Tools team is responsible for Mozilla's Bugzilla
installation, bugzilla.mozilla.org, or BMO for short. BMO has a number of
customizations on top of stock Bugzilla, both internally and as extensions,
and more are created regularly to suit the needs of Mozillians. The BMO
team also helps support a growing number of applications that read from and
write to BMO through its public APIs.

Bugzilla is a core piece of infrastructure at Mozilla. We use it to track
new features, requirements for new projects, security audits, even IT
requests--and of course product defects! We have a small team dedicated to
administering, maintaining, and expanding our installation, and we upstream
changes to the core Bugzilla product where it makes sense. Naturally, even
the changes that are too customized to apply to Bugzilla in general are
open source and available to the public.

Right now, Mozilla is leading an important effort to modernize Bugzilla by
providing a solid and comprehensive API layer based on RESTful practices.
We are experimenting with and supporting new front ends that take full
advantage of modern browsers to create a whole new user experience. This is
an exciting time in Bugzilla's long history as we move into the current era
of web development--join our team if you'd like to participate in the
bright future of an application used by hundreds of organizations around
the world!

The BMO team is looking for a new member to get involved with the next
generation of Bugzilla. Duties would include
* designing and implementing new core Bugzilla features
* designing and implementing external support apps, including front ends
based on the emerging RESTful API
* triaging bugs and feature requests
* day-to-day BMO administration

Required skills:
The ideal candidate would have
* 5+ years experience in Perl
* at least a few years working on large-scale web app, preferably Bugzilla
* 3+ years front-end web-development experience (HTML5, CSS, JS)
* sysadmin experience
* experience with database administration, particularly MySQL

Desired skills:
Plus for experience with
* Python
* ElasticSearch
* systems-level programming
