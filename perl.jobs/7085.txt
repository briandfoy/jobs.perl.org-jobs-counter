Job title:
Senior Systems Engineer/SysAdmin, 200+servers, Linux/Unix, NYC

Company name: GridApp Systems, Inc.

Internal ID: Perl.org GA 708

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
“Do not, under any circumstances, walk into your sysadmin's cubicle and
announce "I have no problem, I just wanted to tell you what a wonderful job
you're doing" unless you want your sysadmin to drop dead from shock” 
~Unknown

POSITION– You will work with version-current enterprise technologies
(VMWare, Veritas, Oracle, NetApp, iSCSI, Fibre Channel) and a litany of
operating systems from AIX to Z/OS that encompass our 200+ server (virtual
and non-virtual) environment. Most start-ups don’t have these things but
since our customers’ databases (Oracle, DB2, Sybase, SQL Server) reside on
every imaginable platform, we use our internal technology infrastructure as
a giant sandbox to develop and test our products. If you are interested in
working with new server, storage, network, and infrastructure technologies,
learning as you go, solving problems in real-time, and planning for the
future, this is the job for you.

It will be up to you to:

**Deploy hundreds of environments in a cost effective, flexible manner
**Incorporate new operating systems and other technologies into the
environment
**Manage configurations of hundreds of hosts
**Minimize incidents and downtimes as a result of unplanned infrastructure
changes
**Figure out the best ways to manage, maintain, and extend the performance
of our resources including identifying needs and purchasing new assets.

While enabling our application development – primarily Perl – to continue
at breakneck speeds.

COMPANY– GridApp Systems is a leader in database automation and management.
Our Clarity™ software and D2500 database appliance provide companies with
the ability to simplify and manage critical database operational tasks such
as deployment, patch management, auditing, and replication across the
enterprise. The company is privately held and headquartered in New York
City. For more information, visit www.gridapp.com.

WORK ENVIRONMENT– Located in the Flatiron District of New York, easily
accessible from many directions, our mission is to transform the way
organizations manage their database infrastructure through the use of
automation. This is not a 24/7 position; you’re here when our developers
are here. Naturally, there may be times when you have to put in the hours
but you won’t be married to a pager or calling in for pizza delivery at
4:00 AM. The development team is top shelf with a myriad of personal
interests that always seem to find their way into our daily activities.

And if you do work at GridApp Systems, you will be well paid, will receive
benefits and stock options, and unlike quite a few companies these days, we
also provide relocation money for stellar candidates.

Come visit our website and see for yourself how our products help companies
manage their data resources smarter. Read the GridApp blog
(http://blog.gridapp.com) and leaf through the great industry, systems,
development, and career resources we’re assembling for you.

NEXT– After you send us your resume (techjobs@gridapp.com), you will
receive a notification of your status within 24 hours. If our team feels
your experience meets our immediate and longer term needs, we’ll call you
for a phone interview. If this goes well, it’s an in-house, hands-on
session that includes a brutal technical grilling by our CIA-trained
interview team.

OTHER POSITIONS AVAILBALE– in software QA, software development (perl),
sales engineering, and sales. Visit our jobs page at

Required skills:
What you must have:

Ability to solve problems quickly and automate systems administration
processes; experience in a production service environment

5+ years experience as a UNIX Systems Administrator 

Experience with Linux, scripting (Perl, sh), TCP/IP networks

While you may not know all of the technologies we work with, your goal will
be to figure out the best way to manage, maintain, and extend the
performance of these resources including identifying needs and purchasing
new assets. If you are interested in working with new server, storage,
network, and infrastructure technologies, learning as you go, solving
problems in real-time, and planning for the future, this is the job for
you.

Desired skills:
Plusses...Experience with storage technologies (SAN, NAS, iSCSI); network
installations; Solaris/AIX/HP-UX; Oracle/Sybase/DB2; sysadmin in a
commercial software development environment; if your experience comes from
working in a web-hosting company - BIG PLUS
