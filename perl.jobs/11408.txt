Job title: Programmer wanted to extend restaurant till system

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Looking for somebody to extend a till system that I wrote a couple of years
ago.  It uses Moose, but it was my first big Perl project, so the design is
somewhat sub-optimal, having said that it's in production for a long time
with no major issues.

The client has written a spec for a new feature, involving loyalty cards. 
I don't have the bandwidth to work on this at the moment so I'm looking for
somebody else to take it on.  If you're seriously interested, let me know
and I can forward you the full spec, and hopefully you will be able to
provide us with a time / cost estimate.  If you want to have a look at the
source, that can be arranged, but client may wish you to agree to an NDA. 
As a guideline, I'd say 2-4 weeks for the right person, but I'm open to
being told differently.

Client wants to keep it thin on the till side, so it's basically a case of
optionally storing a loyalty card number per order, and exporting that
along with all the other details that get exported to their management
systems.

If the right candidate does a good job, there will be ongoing work
available (bug fixes etc).

Required skills:
Perl
Ability to learn quickly.
Understands "good" software design, doesn't just dive in and hack.
Reliable, personable.

Desired skills:
Moose
DBIC
POE
Curses::UI
Linux / Debian system administration
Debian package building (for deployment)
