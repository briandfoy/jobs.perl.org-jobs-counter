Job title: Perl email script

Company name: clackmas paper products

Location: United States, OR, clackmas

Pay rate: bid

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a perl developer to write us a mail script in perl to
send email. We send out a few thousand emails a month to our customers our
little mail program is not up to the task.

 What we need is for a perl developer to create a script to read in our
email details from a csv file:
from_email,to_email,from_name,subject,body,smtp,smtp_username,smtp_password

(for an example:http://www.divshare.com/download/2775473-342)

use this csv file to populate the script with necessary info looping though
each line in the csv file/email and using perl to send out each email. 

We are mainly looking at using perl for its speed and reliability, as our
windows email program fails all the time. Even upgrading to Vista did not
help. We are looking at getting this script written for us in the next two
weeks as we do not have another email campaign until then.
