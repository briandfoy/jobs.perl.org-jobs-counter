Job title: More Cool People Needed

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, Waltham

Pay rate: 40-80K, depending on experience

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I posted this before, but we're looking for even *more* cool people to help
us make the lives of healthcare providers easier.

It helps a lot if you know perl, or have a lot of confidence that you can
pick it up on a dime. A love of hacking Unix (particularly Linux) is also
good, as is RDBMS experience, especially Oracle. A CS or Math degree with
an excellent GPA from a top-tier institution helps a lot.

The emphasis here is on results. You've got to love working with all types
of people, and then using your mad coding skillz to deliver visible,
bottom-line value. Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to
you. The development environment is friendly and open. Work-life balance is
respected and encouraged. The 25 or so folks (geeks? nerds?) you'll be
working with are all top notch, and will probably be some of the best and
brightest folks you've ever worked with regardless of where you're coming
from.

The company itself is one of the brightest stars in the pre-IPO universe,
if we do say so ourselves.  We've been around for about 6 years now; we
were originally backed with $40 million in venture capital from A-list VC's
(Venrock, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Cardinal Health Partners, and Oak), but
the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise any more
capital.

At this point, we're looking for a few good developers & QA test engineers
to hire immediately; salary range is $40-80K plus options and benefits,
depending on experience. The company continues to grow, so there are
significant advancement opportunities for ambitious folks.

If you're interested, shoot your resume over. Unfortunately, you must be
living somewhere in the general vicinity of Boston for us to consider you.
Note: I am not at all interested in telecommuters or contractors. Sorry!

You can send your resume to me, Ed Park (perl -e '$_ =
"eparkATathenahealth.com";  s/AT/\@/; print;'). I'm the Chief Software
Architect over here; I'm directly involved in hiring because I think it's
one of the most important things a company can do.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
