Marchex. We have achieved explosive growth since our inception last year

Click & Call Advertising. We created our platform from the ground-up on
open source technologies using a Service-oriented Architecture. We utilize
Perl, Java, Ruby, Oracle, Asterisk and Linux in an agile development
environment.
