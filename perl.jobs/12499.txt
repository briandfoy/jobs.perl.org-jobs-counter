Job title: Pipelines Web Developer

Company name: Holophrastic Enterprises Inc.

Location: Oshawa, Ontario, Canada

Pay rate: 20'000 - 40'000 based on expertise

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Pipelines is our internal and proprietary web development platform --
written on top of Perl, of course.  Call it a template language if you
must, but basically it automates away 90% of typical web development --
connecting to the database, user logins, security, user preferences, et
cetera.  It also throws umbrella features over everything.  It's really
cool.  Code repositories and version control are gone.	We work on live
sites (Pipelines protects us from stupidity), never document code (it's
legible, that's the point), and focus on the client's business
requirements.  We sell them the flexibility upon which they depend.

This is a home-office, small-business sort of thing, with interestingly
flexible hours.  I'm looking for someone to start off as a protege, and
swiftly grow to be able to handle most of the work in stride.  You'll be
replacing someone who's just left, with big shoes to fill.

With client projects booming now, I need you as soon as possible.

Required skills:
raw perl (no modules), javascript, building web-sites using some kind of
templating language (e.g. template toolkit).  

An understanding of the general flow of a web-site from database, to
backend server, to output stream, to browser client and back again.  An
understanding of the general problems in web development like caching and
speed and security.  HTML, inline CSS, basic MySQL.

You must hate version control systems, we won't be using any.  You must
hate commenting and documenting code, it's redundant to anyone who can read
the code. You must hate block-style css, it over-abstracts layout.  You
must hate optmizing code or writing efficient code, that's not the point. 
Everything we do here prioritizes the ability for the client to make
changes.  That's the only speed that counts.

Desired skills: english writing
