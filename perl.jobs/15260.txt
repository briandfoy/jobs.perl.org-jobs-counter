Job title: Do You Dream in Perl / CPAN Modules?

Company name: RSHughes Co

Location: Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Opportunity for a Full Stack Perl Software Engineer, using old and new
technologies, whatever is best, most efficient.  For someone who enjoys
challenges, is quick to grasp the objectives, can see three steps ahead,
yet is calm and collected.  Right out of school, or with extensive
experience, both work for us, as long as you are motivated.

We work with:
Perl jQuery MySQL JavaScript Linux XML Solr Compass XAO AWS CPAN HTML RegEx
CSS JSON TCP/UDP/DNS JIRA Git Agile Confluence Java CentOs Bash Progress
Apache Spec-2000 SXe.

We are not expecting you to be a 9 out of 10 with
all of these, but we use then all, and they should give you a feel for the
current environment. We have some aggressive project plans and we are
looking for someone that has ideas and will speak up, but also knows when
it is necessary to buckle down and do what we have to do.

Our company is
the largest 3M products distributor in the US and Mexico, with 50 stocking
warehouses. We offer our customers the best services in the industry for
their factory floor supplies, allowing customers to purchase by phone, over
the counter, on the web, or automatically through one of our web-based
proprietary Purchasing and Supply Solutions.

We are a stable growing
company (66 years old), with a small nimble technical team, located in the
heart of ski country. We are a bit laid back, but no, you can't bring your
dog to work, cut your own hair in the lunch room, or show up in a T-Shirt.
You can wear those on weekends.

Full benefits, and you get to work with
great people.

Apply by email -- Let's both save time. This is for
full-time, onsite work. If you are not able to meet this criteria, your
application will end up in the round file. Otherwise, let us know why you
are qualified, the values you would bring to the position, and how you have
effectively applied your skills to past projects. Include your resume with
a contact phone number.

No recruiters.

Desired skills:
Strong Perl, MySQL, Apache and Linux skills.

Comfortable with leading
JavaScript frameworks for fast client side prototyping and development a
big plus.

We also use XML Solr Compass XAO AWS CPAN HTML RegEx CSS JSON
TCP/UDP/DNS JIRA Java CentOs Bash Progress Spec-2000 and SXe.

Using
open-source tools that leverage small development teams.

Familiar with Git
Agile Confluence.

Quick to grasp objectives, can see three steps ahead,
yet is calm and collected.

Four-year degree required.  It can be in French
History, if you are a damn good software engineer.
