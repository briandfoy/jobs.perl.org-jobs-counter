Job title:
Perl and Shell Scripting Linking Filemaker to MySQL and Mail

Company name: MacNexus

Internal ID: none

Location: United States, CA, Sacramento

Pay rate: 75USD/hr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: as needed

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We switched web servers. We run our membership list in Filemaker and had
two perl scripts that went out and added/deleted members from MySQL and
from our mail server. The two perl scripts are called by choosing a menu
action in Filemaker. Filemaker then runs a shell script, adds parameters,
and passes those to the perl script. So Filemaker is able to trigger around
24 account-related functions with only 2 perl scripts. Since moving to a
new web server, this has stopped working and throws up error message "host
key verification failed 255"

Required skills:
Perl scripting
Shell scripting
knowledge of ssh
expert knowledge of unix terminal
OS X version 10.4.10

Desired skills:
Able to run the scripts manually and debug to see where/why it is failing.
Must provide and have good references.
