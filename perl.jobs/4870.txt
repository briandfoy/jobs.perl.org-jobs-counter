Job title: Application Developer

Company name: Digital Craftsmen

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £32-37,000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We've won a new contract and we're looking for an application
developer to join our team.

We build business applications for clients.  The common theme (apart
from being web based) is that they all solve real-world business
problems in an easy to use way. Usability and user-centred design are
key to our work.

Our new project is building a content delivery & management system for
the mobile market. That's all we can say at the moment but it will be an
exciting project for anyone interested in mobile technology, user
interfaces and content management.

Our other work includes document search tools, time tracking, contact
management and business process automation tools for intranets and
e-commerce (www.carmalondon.com), content management
(www.peacedirect.org) and content delivery (www.monday9am.tv) on the
internet. We also make extensive use of the Bricolage content management
system (www.bricolage.cc) and contribute to the maintenance of the
codebase.

The majority of our work is in Perl but we also use PHP & .NET when
necessary & appropriate.

The successful candidate will join a small team of Perl developers
working across all of these projects, taking the lead in some and
supporting in others. We work collaboratively in a relaxed office
environment in Clerkenwell, London, a space shared with a team of music
journalists and mobile media specialists.

Required skills:
The successful candidate will have a good understanding of the
following:

Object oriented Perl
Application design
SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL are all in use)
XHTML/CSS/Javascript/AJAX
Designing user interfaces (from a usability viewpoint rather than
graphically although those skills would be highly desirable too)

Catalyst, HTML::Mason, Template Toolkit, Class::DBI & DBIx::Class are
our tools of choice but experience with other frameworks and templating
systems will be welcome.

You will be a creative thinker and able to visualise problems, develop
solutions and communicate your ideas to business people.
