successful applicant will take a forefront role in maintaining and
enhancing the HapMap’s website content and software infrastructure. The
portfolio of projects is aimed to support scientists in the design,

the scientific community is fostered through technology exchanges, code
reviews, and participation in lectures, workshops, and conferences, both
locally and remotely.

degree in Computer Science plus 5 years of experience as a software
engineer (relevant experience is described below).

One major programming language (Perl, Java, or C/C++), MySQL/Postgres, and
Unix-based systems. Overall experience with Apache, XML, and CGI. Database
experience including object-relational modeling, database administration
and maintenance, and performance tuning; experience in maintaining high
volume databases is highly desirable. Web development experience includes
writing static and dynamic web pages, templates, and server-side
applications. Experience with bioinformatics resources and tools.


Desired skills:
Good understanding of human genetics concepts is highly desirable.
Familiarity with genetic analysis methods is a plus. Working knowledge of
statistics software, such as R.
