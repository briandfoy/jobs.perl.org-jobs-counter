Job title:
Contract Perl/MySQL Programmer needed to take over client base

Company name: The World Community Network

Internal ID: 1

Location: United States, VA, Saint Stephens Church

Pay rate: $50 per hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a number of Perl clients that periodically need small or large
updates to their applications. Since I now work full time (as a Perl
programmer), I'm unable to service my former client base. I need someone to
be available for clients on a case by case basis (based on each client's
approval of them, with my recommendation).

I'm the author of the widely used "MySQL Backup" perl script at
http://worldcommunity.com/opensource as well as other applications. Many of
my clients use one or more of my Perl/MySQL applications, so most of your
work will be tweaking and adding on to the existing code base.

My code is liberally commented, and I'll be available for questions and
help on existing code and applications.

I'm *NOT* looking for someone to come in and rip everything out and do it
all over because that's your preference. Everyone has different coding
styles; I'm looking for someone who can be flexible and not charge my
clients unnecessary money because you like their own system better :-).

You must be US based and speak fluent English - my clients will not want to
make phone calls out of the country. You must also be willing to talk on
the phone with the clients. These are very long term clients who need a
consultant to pro-actively think of their needs.


Required skills:
Perl
MySQL
Some PHP
Excellent communication skills
The highest possible ethical standards
Willing to work with an existing code base
Note: my code is NOT OOP Perl, but makes heavy use of subroutines.


Desired skills: see above
