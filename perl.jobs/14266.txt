* 6+ years professional programming experience with Perl 5; Experience with
Perl Best Practices and PerlCritic; Experience or familiarity with the
following modules: Try::Tiny, Class::Load, XML::LibXML, Test::More,

* 4+ years professional experience working with relational databases (SQL),
MySQL a plus in a highly transactional environment.
* General experience with MVC patterns, ORMs, Web Services
(client/servers).
* HTML and CSS skills to create templates for web.
* Experience with (and troubleshooting) Javascript (jQuery specifically)
for DOM manipulation and AJAX interactions.
* Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in an
exacting manner.
* Effectively able to handle multiple priorities and manage time
efficiently to deliver projects of varying size.
* Must have excellent communication skills both written and oral.

Desired skills:
* Test Driven Development (TDD). Experience developing automated functional
and performance testing suites.

Lean/Kanban).
* Experience with Perl Template Toolkit.
* Ability and willingness to train/mentor junior developers.
