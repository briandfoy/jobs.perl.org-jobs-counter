Job title: mod_perl programmer for healthcare

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, watertown

Pay rate: $50-100+ US

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Who are we? 
We are a 400+ person rapidly-growing software/services company dedicated to
improving the lives of practicing physicians in the U.S.  We are one of the
few successful companies focused on making medical offices run more
efficiently. Our co-founders, Todd Park (Economics, Magna Cum Laude, Lowell
'93) and Jonathan Bush (HBS '98) both helped to found the managed care
consulting practice at Booz Allen & Hamilton.  We have won multiple #1
awards, enjoy revenues of $80+ million per year, and we're just getting
started.  

Why would you want to work here? 
We hire the best of the best: software developers, business analysts,
implementation consultants. If you're looking at Oracle/Microsoft/Google or
McKinsey/Bain/BCG, you'll feel right at home here.  Our product development
branch includes many alumni from Harvard and MIT, as well as former
professors from U. Chicago and Northeastern, a Rand Institute statistician,
and other smart folks who took the road less traveled.	We were also voted
one of the best places to work in Massachusetts by Boston Business Journal
(http://athenahealth.com/Home/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/BBJBestPlaces2005
/).  

In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of DHTML, CSS, and
JavaScript thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we
believe any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of
a couple of months or so. We're more interested in folks with raw talent
and a burning desire to succeed.
