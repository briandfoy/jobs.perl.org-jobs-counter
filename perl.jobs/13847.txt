Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Broadbean Technology Ltd

Location: Canary Wharf, London, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're currently looking for several talented Senior Perl Developers to join
our team in Canary Wharf.

Broadbean is a leading provider of sourcing solutions for recruiters. We
have over 60,000 users who post in excess of 2 million adverts a month via
our award winning software. We also track approximately 9 million job
applications across 65 countries a month. But we want to do more.

We're a small company (90 people in the UK), owned by a very big company,
and a great place to work. Post-probation we offer (non-contractually)
flexible working and 50% telecommuting. We've got a development team of 30
and are fully committed to Perl, clearing our technical debt, and doing
things the right way moving forward.

You will be maintaining the existing product offerings, working on entirely
new code and a combination of the two. The existing code will require you
to be flexible in your approach while the new code will demand to be well
considered and scalable.

We work in project teams that own their respective scrums to deliver
functional continuous integration. You may be on a team for months
delivering several products or involved in short sprints to push out
critical code updates.

Required skills:
You'll need to show proof of strong and "Modern" Perl - at least
familiarity with various testing modules, exposure to Moose would be
useful. You should have opinions that you can justify on the "right" level
of testing, and the pros and cons of continuous delivery. You can take a
stab at the philosophical differences between Catalyst, Dancer, and
Mojolicious.

The in-person interview will test your perl skills (OO, refs, scope, etc)
and as we're looking for Senior devs, the expectations will be high. We are
interested in how you solve problems and your thought process so when you
get stuck, tell us what you're thinking.

This is a company full of new ideas that we bring to life.  If you think
this is a world you want to be a part then letâ€™s talk.	This is your
opportunity to make a difference and be part of an agile, creative and
innovative company.

Desired skills:
* Strong desire to understand business requirements and how to turn these
into code while maintaining the best approach.
* Strong belief in a particular toolset (framework, module, etc) while
being open to debate this opinion with others.
* Solid mentoring skills and the ability to spot both a coder in trouble
and a rising star.
* Experience with designing and implementing projects from the initial
"architecture on a post-it" stage through to the on-going maintenance
phase.
