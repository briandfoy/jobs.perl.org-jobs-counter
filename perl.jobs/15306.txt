Job title: Software developer (18 month contract)

Company name: Science Photo Library Ltd

Location: London, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are currently looking for an experienced Perl software developer to join
our small dedicated team in our West London office. We have several ongoing
projects with the primary focus of this role being the maintenance and
development of our website www.sciencephoto.com.

Science Photo Library has
been an enthusiastic user of Perl for over two decades and it is widely
used on our servers and desktops. Our frameworks include Catalyst, Dancer
and DBIx::Class.  Our database bias is for PostgreSQL but there are times
where SQLite fits the bill.  

As well as working on the website there will
be other projects that may need help from time to time. We love tests and
are always looking to find ways to increase test coverage and ensure system
stability. History is also important and Git helps keep on top of our
codebase. Apart from the gory backend, we like to look good too so a solid
knowledge of JavaScript libraries would be useful.

Desired skills:
•	At least 5 years’ experience in software development with Perl
•   
   A firm knowledge of databases and database practices (inc.SQL)
•      
Solid knowledge of Catalyst, DBIx::Class and TT
•	Capable with HTML,
jQuery and CSS
•	Strong Linux/Unix skills
•	Ability to work
well as part of a team
•	Have good organisational and time management
skills
•	Be enthusiastic, engaging and goal focused.
