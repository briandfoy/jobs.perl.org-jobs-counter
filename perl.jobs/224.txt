I am looking for a full-time job in or near the city of San Francisco,

strong focus on Perl programming in an open source environment.

I have vast experience with XML publishing & content delivery to 3rd

content 

and php programming.

I built an xml-based publishing web site application for html/pdf/wml
delivery. 

I am experienced with linux administration (and NT).
