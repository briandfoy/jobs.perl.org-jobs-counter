Description:
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is a world leader in genomic research,
with an expanding scientific programme dedicated to understanding gene
function in health & disease. 

We are seeking a highly motivated Senior Perl Web Developer to develop and
maintain DAS (Distributed Annotation System) infrastructure for the Ensembl
project, along with developing web displays for DAS data.  DAS is a client
server technology for delivering annotation on genomic sequence, genes and
other biological features, in a standardised XML format. It enables users
to display their own data in the Ensembl browser, facilitating research and
collaboration, and allows embedding of Ensembl data within other software.
The position is in the Ensembl web team working on the Ensembl sites
(http://www.ensembl.org/). The scope of the role includes all aspects of
DAS technology from client and server development to graphical display. You
will be working closely with other members of the Ensembl web team to
integrate DAS into our large scale object-oriented web application.

The role involves interaction with other projects at the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute (WTSI) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI),
the WTSI web team and the external DAS community.

Other information
The WTSI is a world leader in genome sequencing and bioinformatics. The
Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org/) is a collaboration between the
WTSI and the EBI and provides to the scientific community annotation for
approximately 50 genomes.  Ensembl is the largest user of DAS technology
worldwide, both for providing our annotation data and displaying data from
external servers. The service we provide is used by thousands of scientists
worldwide to help in their research.

This is a fixed-term contract until 30th September 2012.

Benefits
The Institute has excellent purpose built facilities on the Genome Campus,
Hinxton on the outskirts of Cambridge. 
We offer a comprehensive range of benefits including a final salary pension
scheme and excellent on-site facilities. Further details can be found on
