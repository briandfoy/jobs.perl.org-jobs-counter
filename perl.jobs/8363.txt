Job title: Platform Engineer

Company name: Integration Appliance

Location: United States, California, Palo Alto

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: full-time

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Platform Engineer

We are looking for a developer interested in eating and breathing
integration. Our platform combines a high-level graphical programming
language, operating system and IDE. To get a sense of the engineering
challenges awaiting you, imagine writing Eclipse, defining the Java APIs,
and implementing the JRE.

The platform engineer focuses on the back-end of this equation, building
systems that enable users to design complex data integration rules through
a front-end GUI. A few clicks in the IDE can take the place of hundreds of
lines of code written in a language like Java or C. The platform abstracts
the heavy lifting so end users don't have to worry about low level details
like creating JDBC connections.

We are looking for an individual who possesses an obsessive attention to
detail, relishes hard technical problems and insists on excellence. This
position entails high levels of responsibility. Developers have the
opportunity to propose new features and are expected to see assigned
projects through completion.

Key Responsibilities

* Design and implement features, enhancements, and bug fixes for our
flagship product

* Help shape product architecture and road map for integration platform

* Participate in all phases of development, from design to implementation,
unit testing, and release

* Weigh functional and usability trade-offs when defining implementation
details

Qualifications

* B.S. and/or M.S. degree in Computer Science or equivalent

* Object-Oriented software development experience


Required skills:
Skills in as many of the following areas as possible: Perl 5, SQL, XML,
Apache CGI/modperl
