Job title: Perl / DBI / mySQL / Apache Programmer

Company name: Peregrine Computer Consultants Corp.

Location: United States, Virginia, Fairfax City

Pay rate:
$12 to $20 / hour commensurate with skills

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: temp to perm

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Peregrine Computer Consultants Corporation has an immediate need for a
highly talented Computer Science/Engineering applicant for a dynamic and
demanding, Perl programming position.

Pleasant, casual-dress environment in downtown Fairfax City with all the
Mountain Dew™ you can drink!

Pay commensurate with experience but there is a not-for-profit aspect to
one of the larger projects we are working on.  

This is an initial "right-fit" contracting position for the purpose of
hiring one or two full-time programmers.

Required skills:
Applicants should have well-honed oral and written communication skills as
well as significant experience with a majority of the following:

Perl (augmentation/modification of existing base code and new development
in like style)

Linux (primarily RedHat distribution with heavy modifications)

Standard protocols such as LWP, SSH, FTP, etc.

MySQL (Administration and standard SQL)

PHP (conversion/modification of existing base code)

C++ (Working knowledge of compilation, installation and minor code changes)


BASH (modification and creation of automated scripts)

Photoshop/Gimp/ImageMagick (Working knowledge and understanding of graphic
formats and web usage)

Apache (General Configuration and Tuning)

Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or Star Office (Technical Documentation)

Desired skills:
Our quote is "Programming is a state of mind, not a language", therefore
the ability to apply what you know and learn other programs, modules, etc.
is far more important that what you might also know.  Our clients and their
needs are diverse so the ability to react quickly to their requests is
important.
