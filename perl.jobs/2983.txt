Architect and Team Lead for Web Applications Development

Company name: RichFx, inc.

Location: United States, New York, New York

Pay rate: $110K+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We provide over 300 of America’s most successful retailers and catalogers
with rich media applications for their online channel. We are the leading
player in our rapidly growing market segment. Our continuing success is
based on superior technology and innovation.

As we continue to grow rapidly we plan to strengthen our R&D team and look
for a highly motivated, experienced, systems architect and hands-on team
leader for our Web ASP platform. The platform is developed in Perl on a
Linux environment. Position will include assuming full responsibility over
the on-going design, implementation, and delivery of our Web ASP platform.
The Architect and Team Lead for Web Applications will oversee a team of 4
developers and will report directly to the VP Research and Development.

Each of our rich media applications follows a common design methodology. We
take existing visual content (images, catalogs, video) and optimize it for
online purposes through the addition of interactivity, animation and
integration with standard e-commerce components like shop systems, site
metrics, site search etc. All our rich media presentations are top-notch
client-server web applications used by millions of consumers. They are
automatically generated by our proprietary set of rich-media generation
tools, embedded in our Web ASP platform. 


Required skills:
•At least 10 years of hands-on experience in designing and implementation
of enterprise-level web applications.
•Excellent system architecture skills, and proven software design track
record.
•In-depth familiarity with both back-end and front-end web technologies.
Explicit hands-on development experience with Perl, on Linux and Apache is
a MUST. In addition equivalent experience with either .NET, or, J2EE is
required.
•Proven development team leadership abilities in a demanding, fast-paced,
rapidly evolving environment.
•Proven track record of delivery of software products from inception to
deployment.
•First hand experience with large storage systems, and large hosting
facilities. 
•Prior experience with imaging and/or publishing systems is a plus.
•A team player with excellent communication skills.
