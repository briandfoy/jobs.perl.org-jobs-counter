Hello,

I am experienced programmer over 10 years in industry. Few years I have
work in the bank. There I have work on payment/transaction systems.
Last three years I specialized on web developing. I offer Perl/CGI and
PHP web developing applied to various databases : MySQL, MS SQL, Sybase
SQL Anywhere. I have exprience in large projects (few megabytes code) and
high performaced sites (10'000 and more visitors per day). I take only $30
USD per hour with $500 minimum order. Follow my advantages:

- Portable code that can work both on Unix and Windows platform. In future
  you can choose another hosting or OS.

- Various database system I can develop for (MySQL, MS SQL, Sybase SQL
Anywhere).

- Fast and pretty code.

- I place html code in templates NOT in code. In future you can change
design,
  text, emails, messages without asking programmers help, using text or html
  editor.

- I have wide experience in SQL databases. This allow me do well optimized
  databases and SQL queries.

- I have over 10 years programming experience and have developed many
  applications during this time. Do my job very professianally.

- I never disapear, and continue help my customers after project is done.
  You can find me online all day.

- Initial minimum order only $500 USD , after/also you can do prepayment
  and ask to do job as you need. For example, one day you need small help
  that take one hour, next day you may need one or two hour, on next week
  few hours until you use your prepayment. Minimal order is only because
  international transfers cost $20 or more per transaction.

- We can discuss fixed price if you have specifications.

- I have many already developed libraries I use during development. It
  save my time and your money. I do more job in same time then other
  programmers.

- Javascript user side programming.

Follow links for some samples of my job:

business in the future.
