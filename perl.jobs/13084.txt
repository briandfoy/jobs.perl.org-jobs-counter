Job title: Senior Perl Genius

Company name: Traveltek Ltd.

Internal ID: SDEVSENIOR

Location: East Kilbride, United Kingdom

Pay rate: Up to £32,000 DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking to add some new people to our already extensive team, and are
on the hunt for senior programmers who think they have what it takes to
master Perl. Perhaps you're already a Perl expert, or a PHP, Python or Ruby
programmer who is looking for a new challenge. We deal with more code (3
million lines and counting) and more data (hundreds of millions of rows)
then you've likely come across before, but if that sounds like fun, this is
the place for you.

Some knowledge of Linux or other flavour of UNIX would be a plus, as this
is what our whole platform runs on. Some database experience is definitely
a must, MySQL especially. And as you will be dealing with customers and we
pride ourselves on good service, good communication skills are key.
Finally, you'll need a willingness to learn. Almost everything we do is
likely to be new to you, and you should be ready for a challenge.

This position is based in our Head Office in East Kilbride. Salary up to
£32K DOE.

To apply please email your CV and covering letter detailing why you feel
you would be suited to this role to jobs@traveltek.net.

Our candidate selection process will require all applicants to successfully
complete a Perl coding test, prior to being invited to attend interview.

Please Note: Applications from recruitment agencies will not be considered,
please apply directly to Traveltek via email.

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL

Desired skills:
- Perl
- Apache
- Linux
- mod_perl
- XML
- Mojo
- Memcached, Redis, Gearman...
