Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for a smart, experienced automation programmer whose also an
MMOG enthusiast to join our Quality and Verification team. If you like to
break things and you know the land of Perl like the back of your hand, we
need you. Online games integrate our rich communications with a C-based SDK
provided for Mac, Linux and Windows clients.

We're building a perl harness using SWIG to interface with this SDK so that
we can do extensive type and message checking (that's what we need Perl
for).

In the coming months, we will need to build an arm of this harness to test
ActionScript for our browser-based clients.

In addition, we're considering a GUI automation tool that records/playsback
and supports Perl scripting for extensive testing with Perl's Test modules.


Environment:
* Very dynamic development framework (lots of builds, interesting tactical
customer challenges -- we evaluate code churn to determine testing
strategy)
* Small development and ops team (lots of direct interaction and team
discussion on fixes and scheduling)
* Early stages of building QA process (little overhead to get started, lots
of room for new ideas)
* Wide range of technologies, platforms and networks

Main responsibilities:
* leading automation effort
* prioritizing and designing test scripts
* reporting, demonstrating and institutionalizing use
* scripting test scenarios large and small
* running scripts and reporting results
* teaching/mentoring other QAers the use of scripts, reading results, etc.

Additional responsibilities:
* working with the existing QA team to complete and report on daily testing
cycles
* build automated scripts for customer reported bugs that are not easily
reproducible by the manual testing
* build multi-client test scripts that Ops and QA can use for stress/scale
testing and client longevity testing


Required skills:
* 5+ years automation programming experience supporting on multiple
platforms and multi-client testing
  * Perl and Test::Simple/More/Deep, etc.
  * SWIG or XS knowledge/experience
* 2+ years testing APIs
* 2+ years interfacing with C-libraries or C programming experience
* 2+ years experience with source control (we use SVN)
* strong familiarity with testing methodology
* demonstrated understanding of distributed systems and protocols


Desired skills:
* SilkTest, Squish, or other GUI automation tools
* Unix/Linux/Mac scripting
* scripting remote client interactions
* Good understanding of network protocols and/or VoIP
