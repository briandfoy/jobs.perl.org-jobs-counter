Job title:
Programmer Analyst with Mason and/or Oracle experience

Company name: Rentrak Corporation

Internal ID: Ovid

Location: United States, Oregon, Portland

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're hiring again!  We still can't seem to get enough top-notch
programmers.  We build enterprise class systems to handle massive amounts
of folding, spindling and mutilating data.  We take the data, shove it into
databases (Oracle and Postgres), and then serve it using mod_perl and
Mason.

Be prepared for test-driven development, pair programming, 40-hour work
weeks and your choice of OS for your desktop computer.

Required skills:
Perl, of course, would be nice.  However, if you have strong experience
with another language or two, we'll consider you.  It would be helpful if
you have an understanding of OO concepts, general database skills and can
discuss the cross-price elasticity of demand between coffee and tea (just
kidding on that last one.)

Send email to Chris Howard (csh at rentrak dot com) with a resume (text,
Word, PDF, whatever) and a brief explanation of why you would like to work
for us.  Please let him know that Ovid sent you.
