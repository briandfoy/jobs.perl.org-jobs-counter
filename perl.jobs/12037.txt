Job title: Web Developer, International Team

Company name: mySociety Ltd

Location: UK

Pay rate: £38-45,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment:
12 month contract with the possibility of extension

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Are you a coder who wants to work on uncompromisingly excellent software,
and make a positive difference to the world at the same time? Would you
like to build incredibly usable open source applications that really help
people in their everyday lives? Would you like to work with one of the most
talented, creative, open source coding teams in the UK? If so, mySociety
may be the place for you.

About Us

 mySociety Ltd is the trading arm of the registered charity UK Citizens
Online Democracy. The charity currently runs several award-winning civic
and democratic websites like TheyWorkForYou.com and FixMyStreet.com, and is
working on genericising our tools for wide adoption overseas.

 We fund 50% of this charitable work through the delivery of world class
web development services, particularly to government and major media
companies, from Channel 4 to the World Bank. In 2012 we’re going to be
rapidly expanding, particularly our commercial and our international teams.
You will be a member of the international team, along with colleagues in
the UK, Estonia and Kenya.

 Everything you will be working on will be open source.


What working for mySociety is like

 Working for mySociety is not an everyday job. You’ll be part of an
unusually skilled, motivated team, arranged in a very flat hierarchy,
working to build tools that help people and communities. We’re widely
geographically dispersed, and a lot of people work from home (although we
are opening a London office soon). There is a high expectation of
self-direction and self-discipline: you’ll normally be left alone to solve
problems, unless you choose to consult colleagues. You’ll also be
collaborating with some amazing volunteers who are incredibly skilled and
dedicated in their own right.  Being part of mySociety means being in the
kind of organisation that is so motivated that the management’s job is
often to tell people to take it easy. We welcome people who, deep down,
burn to make a difference.

Responsibilities

Helping to customise and deploy instances of our websites in countries
outside the UK

Directly collaborate with partners in local countries to help make

Packaging services and web apps for easy installation around the world

Building software as a service versions of our tools for easier
re-deployment for non-technical re-users.

Building and maintaining open source tools to help you develop this
software

Required skills:
At least three years Javascript, Perl, Python, PHP or Ruby experience

Desired skills:
Over five years of Perl, Python or Ruby in professional environments

Over five years experience of Javascript

Multiple years of experience in Linux, Postgres, mySQL, Git, Django

Autonomously conceived, designed and built at least one sophisticated,
