Job title: Lead Software Developer - IMDb

Company name: Amazon.com / IMDb

Internal ID: 026224

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IMDb is seeking a senior software developer team lead for our advertising
team. We offer a small company environment with the benefits of working at
a large company (IMDb is part of Amazon.com, but run separately). We have a
stable and successful business model. 
 
Our advertising subteam is responsible for the development and enhancement
of our advertising technology products within IMDb. This is a chance to
dive deep into the fundamentals of internet advertising technologies,
almost certainly the most successful area of internet businesses to date.
Background or skills in cu rrent advertising software architecture is
helpful but not required. 
 
Please note that this role is a team lead which means that skills &
interest in management of a small number senior software developers is
required, as well as hands on development skills. You can expect that about
25%-50% of your time will be spent management, and the remainder in
hands-on development. This could be a great transition role for someone who
is interest in growing their management skills.

Required skills:
All software positions require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer
science with three plus years of industry programming experience. Our
primary development language is Perl in the Linux/Unix environment, so a
solid base of skills in OO Perl,a working knowledge of database skills
(SQL, basic MySQL/Postgres/db admin) and core Apache skills are required. 

IMDb is owned by Amazon.com, but we operate separately and have our own
technology systems. When you join IMDb, you become a full-fledged
Amazon.com employee - which means you enjoy the cohesive work environment
of a small company while also gaining the bigger benefits of working for a
Fortune 500 company. It's the best of both worlds.

We look forward to hearing from you!
