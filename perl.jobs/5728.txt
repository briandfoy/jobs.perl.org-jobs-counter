Job title: Web/Perl Software Engineers

Company name: Topix.net

Location: United States, CA, Palo Alto

Pay rate: Very competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Topix.net is the leading news community on the web, connecting people to
the information and discussions that matter to them in every U.S. town and
city. A top 25 online news destination (Hitwise, November 2006), the
company links news from 50,000 sources to 360,000 lively user-generated
forums. Topix.net also works with the nation’s major media companies to
grow and engage their online audiences through forums, classifieds,
publishing platforms and RSS feeds. Based in Palo Alto, California,
Topix.net is a privately held company with investment from Gannett Co.,
Inc. (NYSE: GCI), The McClatchy Company (NYSE: MNI) and Tribune Company
(NYSE: TRB).

Are you one of us?
You live and breathe software and the internet. CPAN and Slashdot are only
a click away from your bookmarks toolbar, and improving code performance,
reliability and maintainability intrigues you.

Work and fun aren’t mutually exclusive. You push yourself to deliver your
best, but you’re also easygoing enough to roll with the punches. Releasing
new software to the world pumps you up, and you don’t think twice about
double checking and testing before a push. But you’re also up for hanging
out with the crew and eating pizza on the couch. 

What are we looking for?
Web/Perl Software Engineers
4+ years of commercial programming experience that is recently web focused;
strong programming skills in Perl and knowledgeable with Linux & Apache;
great design skills and a practice of thoroughly testing code before
release.

We’re working on solving interesting and challenging problems related to
crawling, geo-localization and subject categorization of the news. Named
entity disambiguation. About-vs-mention discrimination. Heat and tone
language detection. Zero-configuration scalable crawling. All in-memory
index serving. On-the-fly category merging, clustering, de-duplication, and
geo-spinning. Anti spam. Auto-kickstart servers. Reporting and tracking. 

We need YOU to help our users by improving our forums, news, classified and
other pages. We have multiple positions open at various levels of
experience. Though we don’t expect you to have expertise in solving these
kinds of problems, we encourage you to come and talk to us if they sound
interesting.

If you think Topix is for you....
Step 1: Learn more about Topix, http://topix.net/. Check out our blog,
http://blog.topix.net/, and look around the news and forums on our site.
Step 2: To apply, please send your resume and cover letter to
recruiter@topix.net. We’re looking forward to hearing from you.
