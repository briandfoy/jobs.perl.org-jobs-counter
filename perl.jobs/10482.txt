Responsibilities: 

The EPGY Senior Web Software Developer has broad responsibility for the
EPGY’s web-based applications development. Web-based applications include
programs for use by teachers, parents, and internal EPGY staff members, as
well as middle-ware programs that facilitate interoperability between
EPGY’s internal systems and third-party programs such as Centra and
e-College. 

This position oversees the day-to-day activities of the web-programming
group, and is responsible for overseeing the design, specification,
implementation, and ongoing modification of EPGY’s web-based applications.
In executing these responsibilities, this position leads a small team of
web-programmers for which this position will define projects, set
priorities based on the needs of the whole organization, set and track
project milestones, and manage workloads. 

This position is part of the Senior Programming Staff at EPGY, and as such
is expected to contribute to the development of EPGY long-term programming
strategy. Towards this end this position will be expected to acquire a
thorough understanding of EPGY’s vision for its courses and the proper role
of programming in support of that vision, and will be expected to draw on
strong professional and technical experience in directing the web
applications group towards the realization of this vision. 

Qualifications: 

Bachelor’s degree required. Desirable fields would be Computer Science,
Mathematics or Engineering. 

This position requires a strong technical computing background. 

The following specific experience is required: thorough knowledge of HTML
coding; experience using Perl, PHP, CGI and other scripting and programming
languages; experience in web site design, information architecture for web
sites, and in developing web forms; experience in relational database
systems; experience with accessing databases utilizing XML data; ability to
communicate effectively with people of differing computer knowledge levels;
demonstrated strong oral and written communication skills with an ability
to produce technical documents; sensitivity to and ability to work
effectively with individuals and groups of diverse ethnic and cultural
backgrounds; ability to set priorities; flexibility and ability to handle
multiple assignments and work with minimal supervision under tight
deadlines and in pressure situations; ability to help build and review
requirements and search for commercially-available tools that will allow
EPGY to reduce its level of customized programming directed toward
maintaining student records; a bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience
in mathematics or computer science. 

The Senior Web Software Developer will be required to read, write, and
comment on proposed specifications for tools to be developed. This position
will be required to communicate effectively via email, in-person
conversation, and memoranda with programming staff, EPGY school program
instructors, and other EPGY staff. Because the primary users of the
software are school teachers and other education professionals, an ability
to produce clearly written English prose is essential.
