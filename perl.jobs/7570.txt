My client is seeking experienced Developers with broad technical

and Perl may well be one of many languages you've worked with. It is
essential that you have strong relational database experience ideally with
Postgres; but Oracle or MYSQL are also great. Linux and Apache experience
are also essential. We'd really like to see people who can literally “Hit
the ground running". The role involves full life cycle development for
their core systems and platforms as well as being involved with ad hoc
projects to develop new functions and additions to the system. They have a
great working environment; the team is pretty fluid so there will be an
opportunity to move between teams. They can also offer excellent
progression into team leading, management and technical lead roles. Other
things we'd like to see are; the ability to communicate well at all levels,
a good sense of humour & strong work ethic, someone interested in complex
problem solving and someone methodical and structured would be perfect.
 
If you'd like to know more please give me a call or drop me an email. If
you'd like to apply please send CV's to
