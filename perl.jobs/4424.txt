Description:
CollegeGear.com, the largest and most powerful collaboration of collegiate
and pro licensed manufacturers and retailers on the Internet, is currently
seeking a Perl programmer.

If you have had good experiences with Perl and you're looking for some
place to get your foot in the door to do some real Perl work, this is worth
your attention. We seek a bright, self motivated Perl programmer to work on
our internally developed web applications. This is a great place to learn

programming in another language (C, Java, COBOL, Fortran, e
tc.) for hire in a results oriented business.
- 4 years successfully working closely with other people. This can be in
any field of gainful employement.
- 2 years working in web-based application development (involving
generation of HTML, CSS, or Javascript). The specific language is
not as important as understanding the concepts of web pages, application
flow, and application state.
- Excellent verbal and written communications.
- Clear and consistent coding style, willing to adapt to a corporate coding
standard.


Desired skills:
- Developing or modifying a functioning Perl-based e-commerce system.
- Any kind of work in the retail/warehouse/distribution industry.
- Database design & SQL.
- Experience using any of the following Perl modules: HTML::Template,
Template Toolkit, DBI, CGI::Application, Catalyst or another P
erl-based MVC framework.
    
Bonus points for any of the following:
- Debian GNU/Linux administration or package maintenance.
- Object oriented programming concepts, from a pragmatic viewpoint.
- A love of the Perl language.
