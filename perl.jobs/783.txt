Description:

helps us to optimize the structure and architecture, from time to time...),
and of course, Perl (not mod_perl, just CGI).

1 million e-mail messages a year
thousands of Perl scripts
hundreds of tables (some of them of about 1 GB in size) some 3 million
queries a day on our MySQL DataBase.

We are located in Empoli, Florence (check location on www.multimap.com).

A Job assigned "remotely" (and regularly paid as freelance job)is required
in order to be evaluated (first a freelance job, then we enter in the long
term, onsite partnership).

We accept on-site only candidates.

Please write only to jobs@worldby.com with Ref. "LAMP"

Please do NOT send partnership offers if you are not interested in working
onsite (florence, italy), full time, and exclusively for our Company.

Thanks!

Perl (CGI, not mod_perl), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML.
