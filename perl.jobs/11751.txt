Job title: SR Perl Developer

Company name: Internet Marketing Ninjas

Internal ID: PerlDev

Location: Clifton Park, NY

Pay rate: $60000-$150000 DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We Build Pages is becoming Internet Marketing Ninjas.  We are a full
service Internet marketing company who strives to have the best tools in
the industry.  

We're looking for passionate Perl developers who are looking to do what
they love on a daily basis.  We embrace new technology, love problem
solving, and don't get scared by large data sets.  We do all of this inside
of a fast paced environment developing tools and reports for a quickly
growing team of Internet Marketers.  

We work as part of a cross functional team which includes System
Administrators, Designers, and Perl and Ruby developers.  We all wear
several hats and are quick to help members each other out.  As our team
grows, we are identifying new ways to cross train.  We are doing p2p
training sessions in house, but know when we need to send people out to
quickly bootstrap a new technology.

We're beginning to find ways where we can give back to the Open Source
development community that we leverage so heavily.  Some of us work on Open
Source projects, and we try and are finding ways to send fixes, ideas, and
soon new pieces of code upstream.  

Benefits 
* $60,000 - $150,000 DOE 
* $10,000 Signing Bonus for Relocation, or anything else you want 
* Health, Vision, and Dental Insurance 
* 3 Weeks Paid Vacation 
* Holiday and Personal Days 
* 401k Contributions 
* Profit Sharing 
* Company Sponsored Outings

Required skills:
3-5+ years of Perl Development experience - Should have experience with
Internet protocols, a database extraction layer (we use dbix::class), CGI
programming (we use Template::Tookit) and lots of pattern matching.

Database Skills - You don't need to be a DBA, but should be comfortable
with complex and large MySQL environments.  We're also using MongoDB for
several even larger projects, and some experience there is preferred.

Desired skills:
Front End Skills - We have a design team to polish the cornerstone
projects, but for the most part we do layout ourselves.  Experience with
javascript (jQuery), and a templating system is desirable.

Sysadmin Skills - Again, we have an Operations Team, but if you know
Puppet, Debian based Linux distributions, and have played with cloud
computing topologies, all the better
