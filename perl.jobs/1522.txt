Job title: Operations Programmer

Company name: DM Contact Managment

Location: Canada, BC, Victoria

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permenant

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is a full time position, 37.5 hours per week, salary to be negotiated,
start date is late April/early May and you are providing services to
Internet marketing clients


Your skills:

Your first language is Perl. You may know some C or Java as well. The job
does require some PHP work but if you are at the level we need, that will
not be hard to pick up quickly. Most likely you have at least dabbled in
PHP before. You have a decent knowledge of CPAN. You try to
program in OOP as much as possible but realize its limitations. The main
goal for you is to write code that is readable, reusable, and finished on
time(within reason). You know SQL. This means you can write simple
JOINS on a database you didn't design. Overall this would be considered an
intermediate position, *not entry level*. That also means that you will be
integrated into a team of programmers and designers. Your opinions and
input on all projects will be valued and expected.
You need to be able to take direction as well as be able to offer insight
and opinions. 

Our expectations:

We need for you to be professional and organized. We expect that it would
take around 3 years of focused hard work to get to the level of experience
we require, but the end result is what is important not just how long it
took you to get there. Along with your resume please submit 5 code samples
that solve a practical problems(no classroom type exercises). These can be
complete rograms, subs, or modules. These should be the work you are most
proud of. 

Compensation:

Would be considered average to above average with room to grow. Benefits
include dental and prescription coverage. 


Environment:

There is a never ending flood of hard work and you will learn a lot.
Management is understanding and enlightened. Very little Dilbertizm happens
here. There is a lot of time pressure, but if you enjoy hard work you will
thrive. 


Please reply with your resume in text or PDF format and attach a tar.gz of
your code samples if you are interested in this position.

Required skills:
Perl
php



Desired skills:
CGI::Application / HTML::Template
FreeBSD
Mysql
LWP
Just about anything you know will be put to use somehow.
