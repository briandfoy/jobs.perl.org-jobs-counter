Job title:
Perl and/or Python Sys Programmers, Eugene, OR

Location: United States, OR, Eugene

Pay rate: 40-60k

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Perl and/or Python Sys Programmers, Eugene, OR | 40-60k

Primary Responsibilities include:

The focus of this position will be more on programming than on systems
administration. This individual will be primarily a coder, but with a lot
of interaction at the system level, particularly monitoring of the
services. Responsibilities will include creating files, using SSH to move
files around, using grep to pull memory information from a machine,
monitoring log files, and forking background processes. Reusable code is
important, using object-oriented design where possible. Functional tests
will be written, where possible, to validate the correctness of the code.

All candidates MUST have significant professional experience developing
complex, database-driven applications. This is a challenging position and
is not suitable for novice or entry-level programmers. Only fastidious
systems developers will be considered. As the application uses a database
backend and runs on UNIX, experience with MySQL and Linux (Gentoo a plus)
is required.

Candidates should be able to provide examples of applications and/or
frameworks that they have developed, to discuss practical and theoretical
consequences of design choices. 

Qualifications include:
•Professional experience developing system administration scripts in PERL
and Python
•MySQL and a good knowledge of client-server architecture a must 
•Solid intrapersonal skills and strong trouble shooting skills
•Must have meticulous disposition 
•Experience with Nagios or other monitoring tools is a plus
•Experience with PHP a plus
