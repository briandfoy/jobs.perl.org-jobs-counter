Description:
Ajilon consulting has an immediate opportunity for a Perl and Java

The team is currently working on/supporting 6 web applications. In the
position you will be individually responsible for the full lifecycle
development, from the inception to the delivery, which can take anywhere
from 2 days to 2 months.  

For the initial project will be building a GUI on a DB2/AS400 system to
pull data and put it in a spreadsheet.	

The manager is looking for someone who will be swift on their feet. I
believe there are 3 additional developers on the team.

You will be developing in Perl (65% of the time) and in Java (35% of the
time),in addition to SQL and autosys scheduler.  Prior experience with the
autosys scheduler is preferable, but is not necessary to be successful in
the position. He is interested in brining someone onboard within the next
month.

The position is scheduled to last an initial 6 months, however will likely
be extended beyond that time.

Ajilon can bring you on as either an hourly consultant or a salary employee
depending on what your situation and needs are.
