Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Payment will most likely to be in the form of an equity stake in the
company.

I am looking for a perl developer with strong dbi/mysql experience. Design
of html pages would be very helpful.

Experience in writing or have written reusable modules for error handling
and templates would be very useful.

Face to face meetings near my home would be beneficial, although work is
anticipated to be at home

Desired skills: Graphics design, Website design
