Job title:
Live in sunny Oxford, walk to work along the canal, squeaky clean codebase

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: Oxford, UK

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Friendly and Perl-committed company based in Oxford who build a very
popular software product. They use Catalyst + Starman, DBIx::Class, and are
heavily bought in to Moose. Despite having been running for many years,
almost none of the code is older than 3 years after a successful ground-up
rewrite. FreeBSD users. Itâ€™s a small team, with a start-up feel, so day to
day work can include anything and everything from database schema design
and optimisation, high-throughput scaling work, to UI/UX design, to almost
anything else!

Desired skills: Modern Perl is a must
