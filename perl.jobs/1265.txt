Perl DB programmer (SQL, Apache) in Presidential campaign

Company name: Clark for President

Location: United States, AR, Little Rock

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hi all. Clark for President is planning for the future. We're hiring Perl
programmers and support engineers. Join the movement, full-time.

We need an additional Perl programmer immediately, full-time, in our busy,
lively, 24/7 headquarters in Little Rock, AR.  (For the right candidate,
work from Boston, MA may be possible.)	You'd be joining a very motivated
technology team that includes highly competent (and entertaining)
individuals with a strong commitment to teamwork and to pragmatic
solutions.

Required skills:
Requires strong knowledge of Perl (including DBI, mod_perl, and
HTML::Mason), data manipulation using regular expressions, and expertise
configuring and tuning Apache. A strong knowledge of advanced SQL is also
necessary with an emphasis on MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Desired skills:
Ability to thrive an extremely high-stress environment, including long and
irregular work hours (and multiple and competing Priority 1 issues).
