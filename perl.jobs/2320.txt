Description:
Amazon.com's Merchant Analytics team has an immediate opening for a
talented and enthusiastic software developer with user interface experience
to create and support reporting and analytics features for sellers on the
Amazon.com platform. As part of a small team, you would be involved in all
aspects of the product and have many opportunities to expand your knowledge
and contribute to the success of the team. We are developing tools that
help merchants take advantage of the selling power of Amazon.com. As a user
interface software development engineer (SDE-UI), you will create dynamic,
optimized templates and front-end APIs.  You will participate in the
conception and design of user interface tools and work to make them
functional, usable, and innovative.


Required skills:
Successful candidates for this position will have a strong background in
(OO) Perl, UNIX/Linux, HTML, SQL, and CGI. Experience working with a
variety of web technologies, Mason, XML, DHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and search
engines, as well as setting up Apache services is desired.  Significant
experience with user interface design, usability, and building web clients
is highly desired. Equally important to these specific skills is a
candidate's ability to multi-task, to adapt quickly to new development
environments and changing business requirements, to learn new systems, to
create reliable/maintainable code, and to find creative and scalable
solutions to difficult problems. The ability to communicate clearly and
concisely both written and orally is a key competency as is demonstrable
skill as a self-starter. 


Desired skills:
The data-centric nature of our group means that experience in information
systems, large-scale databases, metadata management, or analytics can be
helpful, but is not required. A bachelor's degree in computer science,
informatics, or a relevant area is highly desired.
