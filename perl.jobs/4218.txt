Description:
We are looking for self-motivated, enthusiastic software engineers to join
our Santa Monica and Redwood City, California offices. We’re a fast-growing
digital messaging infrastructure company.  We’re backed by world-class
investors such as Sequoia Capital (investors behind Google, Cisco, Oracle,
Yahoo! and Apple), Evercore Ventures and Globespan Capital.  Our customers
include blue-chip names such as Intuit, Williams Sonoma, Ticketmaster, Fox
Sports/MSN, Netflix, Citrix, and ClearChannel.	

Our mission is to enable companies to create the most innovative and useful
digital messaging (email, SMS, IM, RSS, etc.) applications to communicate
with their customers.  Example applications would include:  marketing, CRM,
secure e-statements, transactions, customer service, etc.

We have recently closed our Series B round of funding ($9.5 million led by
Globespan Capital, $15.5M total including Sequoia Capital and Evercore) and
have started a new group (think tank).	The purpose of this group is to
inspire worldwide innovation in digital messaging.  Members of the team
will spend 100% of their time brainstorming and executing prototypes of new
ideas around digital messaging.  These ideas will be shared with the world
through our website and/or an open developer community.  

We’re looking for super smart, creative engineers that have strong product
vision.  Team members must be hard-working, and have a strong
entrepreneurial spirit.
