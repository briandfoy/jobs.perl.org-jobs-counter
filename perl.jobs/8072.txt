Job title: Platform Engineer

Company name: Integration Appliance

Location: United States, CA, Palo Alto

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our integration platform changes how people share data among applications
and systems. It combines a high-level language, operating system, and IDE
all into one product. Imagine writing Eclipse, defining the Java APIs, and
implementing the JRE, and you get a sense of the type of engineering
problems you'll be asked to solve.

Our platform enables users to move data between systems with a drag-n-drop
interface. A few clicks in our IDE often translate into hundreds of lines
of code written in a typical language such as Java or C. The ability to
develop faster and not worry about low-level details like creating a JDBC
connection is one reason why customers love our technology.

We are looking for talented developers who enjoy backend programming, like
hard problems, and are interested in building the next generation of our
integration platform.
Key responsibilities:
•	Design and implement features, enhancements, and bug fixes for our
flagship product
•	Help shape product architecture and road map for integration
platform
•	Participate in all phases of software development, from design to
implementation, unit testing, and release
•	Weigh functional and usability trade-offs when defining
implementation details


Required skills:
•	M.S. and/or B.S. degree in Computer Science or equivalent
•	2-4 years relevant experience
•	Object-Oriented software development experience
•	Skills in as many of the following areas as possible: Perl 5, SQL,
XML, Apache CGI/modperl,
•	REST/SOAP, LDAP, WebDAV, Samba, VMWare
•	Excellent communication skills
•	Desire to grow personally and professionally
