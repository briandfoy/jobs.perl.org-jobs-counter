Job title: Senior Perl Developer / API Owner

Company name: Broadbean

Internal ID: SPD0613

Location: London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: up to £60,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
*** YOU MUST BE ELIGIBLE TO WORK IN THE UK ALREADY ***
*** PLEASE, NO RECRUITERS ***

We're looking for a Senior Perl dev in our lovely Canary Wharf office.
Guideline salary is on the higher end of £40-£60k.

It's an unusual role, that we almost ended up calling "Developer Advocate".
You'll be working closely with our external clients helping them integrate
with our API, improving the quality of their API integrations, and building
some two-way integrations between our API and their API. There's a lot of
autonomy in how these API-API integrations will be built, and also a lot of
client interaction. From the job-spec:



We're looking for a Senior Perl Developer to be the first member of our ATS
Integrations team. The company is growing rapidly so it will be faced
paced, challenging but rewarding on many levels. We have a technical team
of roughly 45 people based primarily in the UK but also in the US and
Australia.

You'll be responsible for helping customers integrate with our APIs, and in
some cases building and maintaining those integrations. The role is
necessarily customer facing, and you'll need to be comfortable with the
idea of going to see a client and sketching out a solution around a
whiteboard with their developers, as well as able to build solid
integrations with appropriate monitoring and logging on our end. Over time,
you'll assume responsibility for our API - making sure future iterations of
it support customer needs, improving its mechanisms around authentication
and developing example code that interfaces with it that we can show to
clients.

Required skills:
* Strong, modern Perl
* Ability to design a set of tools from scratch
* Candidate-facing
