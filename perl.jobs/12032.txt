Job title: VM Guest Package Developer (Perl+Linux)

Company name: Barracuda Networks

Internal ID: vm-developer

Location: Campbell, CA, USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Barracuda Networks is seeking a junior- to mid-level-perl hacker to work on
our Virtual Appliance products.  Barracuda Virtual Appliances already
support more host environments than any other vendor (really!) and we're
looking to do even more (more environments, more vm-specific functionality,
etc).

A fair amount of work will be going into our preboot environment, which is
a perltoot-style OOP replacement for init(1).  There is also an automated
build process and packager that needs extension and interfacing with other
teams to implement various VM-specific hooks (again, almost entirely in
perl).

This position will also require occasional patching and rebuilds of the
Linux kernel (and troubleshooting what goes wrong), so if you love perl but
passionately hate C, you probably won't be too happy here.

Barracuda HQ is in the South Bay, conveniently close to highways 85 and 17
and was recently voted one of the 25 best tech companies to work for.

Required skills:
Perl - 2 yrs +
Linux - 2 yrs +
Basic Familiarity with C and the Linux Boot Process

Desired skills:
Any amount of Linux kernel work (having compiled your own kernel is
probably good enough to start).
Being proficient with at least one VM environment (ESX/i, Xen, Hyper-V,
kvm, etc) is a plus.
