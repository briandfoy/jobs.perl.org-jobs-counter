Description:
Perl Developer
Are you looking for an opportunity to show how your skills can make things
happen every day?  A company where you won't be lost in the crowd?  You've
come to the right place.
We are currently seeking a Software Developer with at least three years
experience coding with Perl. We are looking for someone who understands
that Perl is a very serious, high-level programming language used in large,
complex, high-performance applications, and not just a "scripting tool." We
love Perl and so should you. Experience with Windows will not be held
against you, but development is performed exclusively on Linux. You should
be at home on Linux, BSD, or Unix variants. 



About Company:
a leading provider of web performance measurement, systems monitoring and
security vulnerability scanning products that ensure a customer's critical
web-based services are always available and running at peak performance.
Company's range of hosted Internet services benefit all types and sizes of
businesses and organizations. Founded in 1998, based in Coconut Creek,
Florida and offers an exciting fast-paced environment with many challenging
projects. We are large enough to provide a stable work environment and
competitive benefits, yet small enough to present many opportunities for
growth and advancement. 


Required skills:
Requirements: 
3+ years programming in Perl in a Linux environment 
SQL experience (we use MySQL) 
HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, CGI and web development experience 
Full project life cycle experience 
Strong written and verbal communication skills 
Highly motivated, able to work both in a team and solo 
Must be able to meet deadlines and work well under pressure 
Strong attention to detail
