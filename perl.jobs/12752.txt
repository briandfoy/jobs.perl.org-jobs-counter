Job title:
Senior Perl Programmer for full-time, telecommuting, long term interesting
work on a large website

Company name: Start Local

Location: Sydney, NSW, Australia

Pay rate: $20-25USD per hour depending on skill level

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We're looking for a new programmer to join our development team on a
full-time basis, working from home.

We run one of the largest business directories in Australia and currently
get more than 1.5-1.7 million visitors each month. We have been developing
our system for more than 4 years so this is an opportunity to join a
sophisticated team that is doing exciting things and solving complex
problems with technologies around local search, Perl, Solr, API creation,
jQuery and ajax.

The Senior Perl Developer that we are looking for will help the evolution
of functionality of our site and help the expansion of the site across
vertical local directories and internationally. We are looking for an
exceptional individual that wants to push the boundaries of Local Search in
Australia and across the world.

Our team workflow is well thought out and solid with individual development
servers, a group staging environment, redmine ticketing system and version
control.

You would be working directly under our lead developer and your
responsibilities in this position may include:

- Overcome tough, technically oriented challenges in the local search
market.
- Work with Javascript and jQuery for the UI.
- Working with varnish caching servers and other methods to help speed up
the system and manage load.
- Discuss, design and develop large scale search solutions in Perl, HTML
and SOLR.
- Utilise MySQL, sql programming, stored procedures and database design.
- Work within an English speaking, team based environment.

--Important--
1. You must be willing to be online and available to text chat during some
of the Sydney, Australia working hours (GMT+10) each week day.
2. You should be available at least 40 hours each week.
3. At this time we are looking for individuals, not agencies.
4. You should be looking to have a single client (us) as your focus going
forwards. It is too hard to build long term relationships with people who
are working for many different clients.  
5. You are ready to get started asap or shortly.

Although the pay rate is listed as an hourly rate, there won't be any weeks
that are planned at less than 40 hours for the week. It's a full-time
position that we are looking to fill. 

In your response, please particularly provide your experience with Perl as
well as any example scripts that you have which you've written that provide
a good indication of your coding skills.

We are looking for a long term arrangement with the right developer(s).

If you have any questions around the position please feel free to ask.

Thank you for your time. 

Regards,
Robin
