Job title:
Senior and/or intermediate software engineers with perl

Company name: GoodData

Location: Prague, Czech republic

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Not limited to Prague (the capital), there are also vacancies in Brno.

You
will be involved in development of various aspects of GoodData platform,
ranging from RESTful API, data processing, performance tuning at various
levels, fixing bugs (yes, we do them, too), to enhancing testing
infrastructure. And much, much more.

You will be working in multinational
team spanning 3 continents.

https://www.gooddata.com/company/careers-list?p=job/ovN93fwe&nl=1

Unfortunately, we are not providing relocation assistance. European
citizenship or valid working visa is a must.

Desired skills:
Easy to get along personality. Is this actually a skill? Not sure, but
still highly desirable :-)

Computational thinking. Perl would be a huge
advantage, yet experience with other dynamic languages counts.

General
understanding of how relational databases work combined with experience
with any such database is what we need. Hands on experience with
MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL and/or Vertica is huge plus.

Craftsmanship.
Sure, hacks are inevitable sometimes, but we value good design and
easy-to-maintain code more.

Linux should be your friend.
