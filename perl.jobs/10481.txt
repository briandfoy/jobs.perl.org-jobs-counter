alternatives, conclusions, and decisions about programming projects, 
• developing new approaches to projects and implementing new technologies, 

• documenting procedures and practices concerning server¬side programming. 


Additionally, this position 
• supervises EPGY’s database administrator and possibly other staff who
support EPGY’s web and application servers, 
• leads EPGY’s response team in the event of emergency in order to maintain
EPGY’s goals for server availability, and 
• participates in 24/7 on call rotation supporting the EPGY course
environment applications and the content/proxy servers as a single point of
contact with the ability to address problems for a remote server
independently during an off-hours shift. 

This position may also be needed to travel out of state on occasion to
visit large school districts that are running EPGY courses for onsite
deployment and/or troubleshooting. 

Qualifications: 

• a proven track record of working on complex, web-based, large-scale
programming projects, 
• a solid understanding of the software development and build processes,
release engineering, and configuration management, 
• a thorough command of Linux, 
• experience with SVN or another source code control system 
• a strong working knowledge of Perl (or Python or a similar scripting
language), 
• significant experience with Oracle or another relational database system
including knowledge of SQL, and 
• sufficient understanding of computer networks to monitor and analyze
networking for EPGY's application and make improvement proposals to the
system team. 

Candidates must have 
• demonstrated strong oral and written communication skills with an ability
to understand and maintain technical documents; 
• ability to work effectively with individuals and groups of diverse ethnic
and cultural backgrounds; 
• ability to set priorities; flexibility and ability to handle multiple
