You will:

●	Develop

optimise the technology that powers our servers,       applications, and
databases.
●	Work closely with other teams to come up with effective

You have exceptional programming skills, and
extensive experience with relational databases.

You love developing

and APIs.

You are smart, self-motivated, and proactive. You thrive in a
dynamic work environment, and approach even the smallest task with an open
mind.

Most importantly, you seek open and honest communication — even
under extreme pressure and deadlines.

We are looking for someone who loves
to:

●	Test and fix things, especially when it involves working with
data.
●	Optimise web applications and infrastructure for maximum
speed and scalability.
●	Do great work, and inspires people around
them to do the same.
●	Work with highly talented people in an
exciting, multinational environment.
●	Get things done in a
no-nonsense manner.
●	Work without bureaucracy and hierarchy.
●

You should be technically strong, and
proficient in the following:

●	Expertise in Perl with experience in
Python, C, PHP, Go, and Ruby programming languages.
●	Expertise in
Linux system administration.
●	Experience with relational database
design, and/or open-source RDBMS systems such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
●   
   Familiarity with Perl DBI, Moose, PSGI/Plack, NGINX, JavaScript, Redis,
and Git.
●	Ability to produce high-quality, self-documenting code by
using test-driven development (TDD) techniques.
●	Passion for Linux
and other open-source platforms.
