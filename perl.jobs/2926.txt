Description:
Senior Software Engineer/Unix System & Network Administrator, Google.com
(SRE) 
Positions based in Mountain View, CA and in our European Operations HQ in
Dublin, Ireland. 

Are you part ace coder, part adrenalin junkie? Do you have a knack for
seeing a problem and immediately discerning the likely solution? Maybe
you've been coding for years, are bored with the old
design-build-review-test-ship-repeat routine, and yearn for some
faster-paced challenges? Or perhaps you're a seasoned software engineer who
is also a genius at jockeying networks and administering UNIX clusters. 

We're looking for top-notch thrill seeking, software engineers to join the
Google.com team. Google.com engineers are in the thick of everything
involved with keeping Google running, from code-level troubleshooting of
traffic anomalies to maintenance of our most cutting edge services; from
monitoring and alerts to building new automation infrastructure. We are
aggressively building this elite team of high level engineers in this
mission critical environment. All team members must have strong analytical
and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding, good communication skills,
and most of all enthusiasm for tackling the complex problems of scale which
are uniquely Google. Google.com engineers tackle challenging, novel
situations every day, and work with just about every other engineering and
operations team in the process. 


Required skills:
Qualifications: 
•	Strong programming/scripting skills in any of the following: C,
C++, Java, Perl, Python. 
•	Senior Level experience with Unix system administration. 
•	Strong understanding of networking; understanding of how to
isolate, diagnose, and resolve service delivery components (service
delivery components include servers, networks, and applications); be
familiar with the functionality, operating, and failure modes of key
networking devices (routers, switches, bridges, firewalls, hardware load
balancers); be able to identify networking as the potential cause of a
service issue using server-resident tools to generate this data (tcpdump,
ping, traceroute, etc.); familiarity in interpreting the output of these
tools; familiarity with common network topologies, protocols, and tools;
have some notion of common network security exploits -- and their remedies;
understanding of troubleshooting at the packet level. 
•	Strong project management skills, especially in deploying live
end-user systems. 
•	In-depth knowledge of Unix (preferably Linux), and shell scripting.

•	Proven technical troubleshooting experience. 
•	Excellent analytic ability, strong communication skills, and a
strong sense of urgency. 
•	Ability to handle periodic on-call duty as well as out-of-band
requests. 
•	6-15+ years experience for Senior SWE position, or 3-8 years
experience for SWE position. 
•	BA/BS in CS, or equivalent experience.
