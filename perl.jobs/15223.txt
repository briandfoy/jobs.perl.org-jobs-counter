Job title:
Add perl functions to a Responsive Dashboard Template

Company name: Not Applicable

Location: San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hi... I got an old looking existing, non-responsive DEMO  "Dashboard" for
Hotel Management coded in php.

I need help by you making a replica of this
DEMO panel in Mojolicious perl. 

You can search for any free or open
source ready to go dashboard responsive template of your choice.

Then..
login to this yucky php panel and checkout the functions so you can
replicate them in gorgeous perl.

You will see that on the left there are 8
tabs as follows: 

1) General
2) Accounts
3) Hotels Management
4) Bookings
5) Menus and Pages
6) Languages Settings
7) Mass Mail & Templates
8)
Modules

Navigate each tab, check out the functions and give me a quote for
each tab separately.

the reason why I need a separate quote for each tab
is because each tab will be a different milestone. You will get the funds
in advance, (in escrow), before you start with the code for each tab.

Here
are the panel Credentials:
