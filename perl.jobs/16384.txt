Job title: See the Hipster in his Natural Perl Environment

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: Shoreditch, London, UK

Pay rate: Competitive salary based on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Where can you find the best curry in London?

Time was you had to go to the
store and buy a record/cassette tape/CD if you wanted to hear that great
new song. Then Napster came along, and it was a music free-for-all.
Copyright who? The advent of the internet changed the way we listen to
music forever, which is fine for major artists like T-Swift, but what about
the indie guys and gals who need a way to protect what=E2=80=99s theirs?

That=E2=80=99s
where our client comes in. They provide a platform for musicians and
industry professionals to manage their work and while making sure they get
paid for it. If you support independent music, or if you=E2=80=99re just a =
fan of
artists getting compensated enough to drop the =E2=80=9Cstarving=E2=80=9D p=
art from their
title, then this might be the job for you.

Our client is in the market for
a full-time, mid-level developer who can make sweet, sweet music with
Catalyst, TT, Moose with Plack, and mod_perl. If you get down with Elastic
Search and party with Postgres, you=E2=80=99ll fit right in at this uber-co=
ol
company with start-up vibes and long-term staying power.

Located in the
hipster haven of Shoreditch, the office is nothing like your
beige-walls-and-fluorescent-lights cubicle warren. Graffiti art outside
lets you know you=E2=80=99re in the right place; soaring rafters and cool w=
indows
inside remind you that you=E2=80=99re worlds away from ordinary. Oh, and di=
d we
mention that Shoreditch has the best curry in London?

If this sounds like
your jam, send us an email now, before this role goes the way of Napster
and disappears forever!

Desired skills: Strong Modern Perl
