Job title: mod_perl/Mason/MySQL Programmer

Company name: Steve Jackson Games

Location: United States, TX, Austin

Travel: 0%

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Steve Jackson Games is looking for an experienced Perl coder to work on
various projects, including our online storefront, our in-house databases,
and online games such as the almost-complete UltraCorps (
http://www.ultracorps.com ). All these projects involve OO Perl, mod_perl,
Mason, and MySQL.

This work could range from full-time to (for less-urgent projects) as
little as ten hours a week. We would love to find someone in Austin, but we
are willing to work with telecommuters. We would certainly consider
full-time employment, but we recognize that a contract relationship is
likelier.

Please respond to perljob@sjgames.com with a current resume and relevant
samples of your code.

Required skills: OO Perl, mod_perl, Mason, and MySQL
