Subject: Job Offered: Perl CGI Engineer, Menlo Park, CA full-time
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: aghose@getthere.com (Anjan Ghose)


GetThere, a division of Sabre is the leader in on-line travel services for
major corporations and
airlines. Our Operations Department is responsible for planning and
deploying new system environments
troubleshooting problems, maintain and upgrade current environment,  develop
tools for operational
efficency and evaluate new technologies to further solidify our core
infrastructure. We are
looking for a knowledgable Tools engineer to work with our team in all of
the above areas. Check us
out at http://www.getthere.com

You will play a key role in developing web-based tools, for systems
monitoring, capacity
planning and customer reports. You will improve our current library of CGI
tools, written almost
exclusively in Perl. Strong Unix systems administration background and
strong Perl skills are required.
Knowledge of C, shell scripting, SQL or Java is helpful.  BEA Application
server knowledge a plus.

You will get an in-depth exposure into what it takes to streamline and
automate a 24x7
e-commerce business with multiple data centers running in a Solaris/Linux
environment. The 
position will require interaction with internal users, gathering feedback on
what automated
elements are missing, and design and implement web-based tools to fill these
needs. You would
be part of the  systems administration team and should have a good
understanding of unix system
administration. You must be a self-starter with initiative and motivation to
build a quality 
streamlined environment. Growth opportunities for the right engineer are
significant.

Though we strongly prefer you to be in Menlo Park, CA, the right candidate
may be considered for the
same position at our Manhattan, NY or Dallas, TX office. Telecommuting will
be an option once or twice
a week after the initial familiarization.
