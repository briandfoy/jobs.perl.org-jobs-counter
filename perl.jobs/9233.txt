Job title: LAMP/Mod_perl apprentice

Company name: writch

Internal ID: 1

Location: United States, CA, Ukiah

Pay rate:
negotiable, but not terribly high (rural work)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
I have need of an assistant in the Ukiah area to help support my customers
when I'm not in town.  This could lead into a lot more work over time, but
at the start it's not going to be a 'primary income' sort of job.   

This involves the care and upkeep of two linux servers (one internal, one
external) running Apache, Samba, MySQL, PHP and Perl, an office of mixed
PC/Mac machines, one of the most incredible networked printers I've yet to
run across, and the network infrastructure.

Required skills:
Perl (mod_perl), PHP, Apache, network admin, server admin aptitude (at
least enough to get past my spam filter).  Cheerful and positive
disposition.  Integrity. 

You should have at least *tried* to build a LAMP server, in your head, if
nothing else.

Desired skills:
Self-starter, curious, somewhat paranoid (there's security work involved),
even-keeled (not inclined towards paranoia, just good at it),
customer-service oriented.  An appreciation for high-end hardware (perhaps
a gamer) would be good as well.
