Description:
We're looking for someone smart and talented to join our team and help us
build innovative services for citizens - real people - like you and me.

You are an ideal candidate if...
You've got quite a few years of development experience. We're looking for a
seasoned developer to join our team, who has seen a few different projects
and knows how to get the job done.

You love RESTful architectures. You know how to think API first, and then
how to build out the front and back ends to make your users happy.

for the most diverse audience possible, from the tech savvy to the visually
impaired and the elderly. Help us make ReCollect simple to use by every
segment of the population.

You understand the value of amazing customer service. Everyone at ReCollect
talks with our customers (who LOVE us) and you will too, so it's critical
you can communicate extremely well.

You have a home office that makes you happy and productive. We are a
distributed team at ReCollect - so we rely on a bevy of tools for
productive work. Several ReCollectors have worked in small, globally
dispersed, highly productive teams - building great code. Our spiritual
centre is in Vancouver, bonus points for nearby candidates.

You want to make civic life better. At ReCollect we have a simple goal: to
make life a little easier for people. You'll work with our customers in
government across North America to help them make their resident's lives
easier with ReCollect.
