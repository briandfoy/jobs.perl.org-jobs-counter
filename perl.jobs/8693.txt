Description:
We are a small technology company specialising in the internet and
e-commerce.  We work with designers to provide technical back-up for their
web projects.  So we develop content management and e-commerce software,
using Perl, MySQL, Unix and Apache.  We also do IIS if we have to. 

Our direct customers are designers.  Form beats function every time for
these guys and they are often confused by technical detail. Nevertheless we
have to work with them to satisfy end-users, who often have a business that
depends on the quality of our work.  

It can be interesting.	

If you are a Perl enthusiast with a solid background and reasonably
user-friendly, we need you.

The ideal candidate will:

- Hold the following essential technical requirements: Perl, Unix, SQL and
a knowledge of HTML and Style Sheets
- Have a strong desire to learn new skills in this rapidly changing
technical environment
- Have the ability to come up with creative solutions to technical and
end-user problems
- Be able to deal with customers who are often technically illiterate;
patience and communication skills are a must.
- Have the maturity to drive the future technical direction of the company
and lead a small team
