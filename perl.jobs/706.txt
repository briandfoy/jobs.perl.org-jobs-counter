ABOUT US:

Amazon.com, a Fortune 500 company based in Seattle, opened its virtual
doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995 and today offers Earth's Biggest
Selection. Amazon.com seeks to be the world's most customer-centric
company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to
buy online at a great price. Amazon.com and sellers list millions of unique
new and used items in categories such as apparel and accessories,
electronics, computers, kitchenware and housewares, books, music, DVDs,
videos, cameras and photo items, toys, baby items and baby registry,
software, computer and video games, cell phones and service, tools and
hardware, travel services, magazine subscriptions and outdoor living items.


JOB DESCRIPTION:

When was the last time you walked into a store where the clerk greeted you
at the door with an item selected just for you? 
In the world of online commerce we can accomplish the seemingly impossible
- building a store for every customer, picking relevant items from a
universe of millions, all in the blink of an eye, thousands of times each
second. Work with the best personalization technology on the planet - work
at Amazon.com: 

**Build compelling, usable interfaces to massive, complex information
spaces 

**Conceive of creative new ways to connect people with things they didn't
even know they wanted 

**Design mechanisms customers can use to make the website *their* website 

**Help define the business direction of the team. Life isn't all code,
after all. 

Do something real, something that matters. Have your work used by millions
of people every day. With the largest laboratory in internet space, we
offer immediate gratification as part of our benefit package. 


Required skills:
We are looking for smart, driven, and articulate web developers who love to
build websites, love to see their solutions in use, recognize the
revolutionary nature of the internet, and thrive in small, cross functional
teams. If you're an expert in standard web development languages (HTML,
CSS, XML, Javascript) and have a solid background in programming (Perl, C,
C++) and familiarity with object-orientation, database-driven websites, and
UNIX, you qualify. Customer focus, an interest in business, experience in
interface design and usability would be nice pluses. A bachelor's degree in
computer science, or a relevant area, is icing on the cake. 


Desired skills:
Benefits: Medical, Dental, Vision, Life, AD&D, Short/Long Term Disability,
Flexible Spending Account, 401(k), 529 College Savings Plan, Employee
Assistance Program, Vacation, Personal Time, Paid Holidays, Amazon.com
shopping discount, Employee Referral Bonuses, Discounted Computer Purchase
Program, Restricted Stock Units, other employee extras.
