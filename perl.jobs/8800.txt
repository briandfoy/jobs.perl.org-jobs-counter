Job title:
Contract Perl Web Developer for Shopping Cart Platform

Location: TX, Houston

Pay rate: Negotiable 

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We have a shopping cart platform that was developed in Perl, but the
original developer is no longer able to support it or make updates.  The
existing code has limited commenting but has well named variables and is
very modular so it is hopefully not too difficult to decipher.	The
original developer will also be available briefly for any needed
clarification.

Several sites currently are using the shopping cart platform and more will
be added after securing this position.	We need someone who can quickly get
ramped up on the code to handle a backlog of changes, and who will also be
able to assist with future updates.

This is a telecommuting position with most communication happening over
email, IM or phone.  Selected candidate will ideally be able to start ASAP. 

Required skills:
PERL on Windows but may move to UNIX eventually
Effective and timely communication


Desired skills:
Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript 
Familiarity with payment gateway integration
Familiarity with ImageMagick
