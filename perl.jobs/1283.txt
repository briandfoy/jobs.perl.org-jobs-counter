From: dave@easy-protest.com (David Della Costa)

Hi, my name is Dave Della Costa.  I have 4.5+ years experience 
developing web applications with Perl and Java, and my Linux (especially 
Red Hat and Gentoo) system administration skills are top-notch.  I am 
interested in a full-time position as well as part-time or contract 
work.  You can check out my resume online (in pdf, word or html format) 
at http://www.easy-protest.com/resume.html.  I am primarily interested 
in New York City area positions (especially Manhattan) or telecommute work.

Projects I've done include:  architecturing and building large parts of 
ecommerce system, using Java, MySQL (with JDBC), and Tomcat,  an online 
survey driven by mod_perl with MySQL optimizations, and numerous content 
management and online administrative programs in Perl.

If you think I might be able to help you out, please don't hesitate to 
email (dave@easy-protest.com) or call at (212)678-2137 (home) or 
(646)287-6772 (cell).

Thanks!

Dave Della Costa
