Description:

Full time applicants only please.  Unique telecommuting opportunity for
mature self driven independent senior open source developers.  If you are a
hard worker and have always desired to work in a community like environment
with minimal management oversight this is the job for you.  OpenAir
provides business process/workflow software and we are looking for
individuals who enjoy the rewards that not only come with corporate
success, but also by having their work really make a significant impact to
the product.  

Evolve often minimally-defined client business requirements into
professional quality OpenAir solutions which satisfy not only that client,
but have the flexibility and customizability to be used by clients with
differing business processes and needs.  These solutions may require the
conceptualization, design and implementation of a full-blown OA Module,
they may require evolving the system with architectural extensions or they
may dictate a minimal tweak to existing functionality. 

Fully scope out the impact of an implementation by considering all of the
necessary changes and any impact they may have on other parts of the
product.

Work in the OA development environment which is defined by ASP deployment,
a rapid release cycle and based on the Extreme Programming software
development discipline combined with the OA operating principle of customer
service orientation.  This environment mandates that bug fixes impacting
clients take precedence over both quick on-demand enhancements and longer
term planned development initiatives.	It also means that quick on-demand
enhancements often take precedence over previously planned initiatives. The
rapid release cycle insures that features that are pushed out past a
release date because of this operating principle can be addressed in either
the next scheduled release or slip-streamed in the interim.  This
environment insures that we have a high level of confidence in setting
client expectations.
