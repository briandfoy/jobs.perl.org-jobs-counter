Company name: LinkExperts, Inc.

Internal ID: SSA

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: $70K-100K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Description:
LinkExperts is an emerging leader in natural search solutions, enabling
high-end companies to gain a competitive advantage through web-based
advertising efforts. What sets LinkExperts apart from its competition is
its scalable technology platform, along with its commitment to relevancy,
quality and best practices.

With deep experience in the online world, great technological insight and a
commitment to ethical innovation premised on a belief that the highest
quality Internet experience is a benefit to everyone, LinkExperts is poised
for significant growth, and you're invited to be a part of it.

Link Experts is looking for an experienced systems administrator to take
responsibility for a wide range of systems support and development
activities.

This position is full-time, onsite in our Manhattan offices. We are looking
for people with full-time, commercial experience in maintaining Linux
systems. This position represents the opportunity not only to make sure
that systems administration is done right, but to build a department for
systems and network architecture and support.

What you’ll do:

    * Monitor and maintain the Gentoo-based Linux servers in our office and
remote data centers.
    * Install and maintain our Kubuntu-based desktops.
    * Monitor and maintain the networks we use.
    * Design new server and network resources.
    * Administer our VMWare virtual servers.
    * Support the non-Linux desktop resources in our office.
    * Work with vendors to obtain hosting, support and installation
resources.
    * Improve the systems administration and support processes by
automating and documenting them.
    * Write Perl programs to increase the level of systems automation.
    * Write and maintain programs in Perl where appropriate for the
applications development group.
    * Keep everything running and running well. 

Required skills:
    * 4+ years hands-on, full-time, commercial experience in Linux system
administration, with responsibility for multiple servers in multiple
locations.
    * 2+ years of solid experience writing Perl programs.
    * Experience with VMWare Server
    * Excellent communication skills. This is for real, not just thrown in
to make this posting look impressive. If you can't communicate your ideas
and objections clearly and persuasively, how can anyone learn from all the
wonderful things you know? 

Desired skills:
    * Experience leading a team of administrators.
    * Experience with the Gentoo Linux distribution.
    * Knowledge of LAN/WAN equipment, protocols (BGP, OSPF, etc.) and
troubleshooting
    * Knowledge of Apache's more interesting features and how they apply to
PHP and web development
    * Experience using and administering Subversion
    * Knowledge of Microsoft Office applications.
    * Experience with Microsoft Windows setup and configuration.
    * Not being afraid of telling your boss how their ideas are wrong (if
you know how to do it right).
    * Previous contributions to open source projects. We'll encourage and
support you in doing more of that.
