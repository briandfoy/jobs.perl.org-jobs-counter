Synacor is not your typical 9 to 5 workplace.  Our award winning culture

and t-shirts are typical office attire, even for the executives.  Teamwork
is an everyday occurrence, and is made easy with our new open workspaces. 
Our leadership team understands that the best results come from
collaboration, so we hire the best and brightest and then let them do what
they do best: create cutting-edge products and provide exemplary customer
service.  Synacor's headquarters is located along Buffalo's waterfront in
the Erie Basin Marina. Taking a few minutes to enjoy the serenity of nature
is as easy as walking 1,000 feet or so to the water. We even have a
lakefront gazebo with wi-fi connection!  And if that’s not enough,  Synacor
pays 100% of health care premiums for employees AND dependents, offers
stock option participation, a healthy bonus potential and a very generous
paid time off policy. Working with some of the largest cable, telecom and
satellite providers, Synacor’s products and online services reach over 25
million high-speed Internet subscribers worldwide.  We are looking for
great people to join our team and be given the freedom to do the work they
were hired to do.

•	Conducting peer reviews in an agile environment  
•	Other duties as assigned.

What we’ll bring to the table:

employees and eligible dependents
•	Competitive compensation package, including stock option grants
(for eligible positions)

•	25 cent vending machines
