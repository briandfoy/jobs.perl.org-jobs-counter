Job title:
CA-West Hollywood: Quality Assurance Engineer for Perl House

Company name: Ticketmaster

Internal ID: TMO-T13

Location: United States, CA, West Hollywood

Pay rate: commensurate with skills

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Full-time, regular hire

Description:
If you take great pride in your QA testing and your ability to apply
quality assurance processes within fast-paced environments, then you've
found a new home. Ticketmaster, a leading supporter of open-source
technologies, is looking to add a few testers to help our team grow. If you
have a desire to work in a challenging and rewarding environment in sunny
southern California, then Ticketmaster is where you should be. NOTE: Our QA
group is NOT heavily tools dependent, in other words, if you have a primary
goal of writing automation scripts for a particular tool (e.g., winrunner,
silk, etc.), then this may not be the road for you to travel. If you're
interested in applying QA theory and processes to a new environment and
aiding the director of quality assurance in the application of these
processes, then this may be the place for you. Of course, be ready for some
heads-down testing!
