Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: NetSuite

Location: Brno, Czech Republic

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Assist Senior Development team to Evolve often minimally-defined client
business requirements into professional quality NetSuite OpenAir solutions
which satisfy not only that client, but have the flexibility and
customizability to be used by clients with differing business processes and
needs.	These solutions may require the conceptualization, design and
implementation of a full-blown NetSuite OpenAir Module, they may require
evolving the system with architectural extensions or they may dictate a
minimal tweak to existing functionality. 

Support the Senior Development team to scope out the impact of an
implementation by considering all of the necessary changes and any impact
they may have on other parts of the product.

Work in the NetSuite OpenAir development environment which is defined by
ASP deployment, a rapid release cycle and based on the “Extreme
Programming” software development discipline combined with the NetSuite
OpenAir operating principle of customer service orientation.  This
environment mandates that bug fixes impacting clients take precedence over
both quick on-demand enhancements and longer term “planned” development
initiatives.   It also means that quick on-demand enhancements often take
precedence over previously planned initiatives. The rapid release cycle
insures that features that are pushed out past a release date because of
this operating principle can be addressed in either the next scheduled
release or slip-streamed in the interim.  This environment insures that we
have a high level of confidence in setting client expectations.
