Job title: Sr. Perl Software Engineer

Company name: Campus Explorer, Inc.

Location: Santa Monica, CA, United States

Pay rate: OPEN

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Campus Explorer, Inc. is a fast-growing web startup with demonstrated
success and great prospects. Our open office includes nice views of the
Santa Monica mountains and lots of fine restaurants across the street.

You'll be joining the existing team members at Campus Explorer, who have
played critical roles in a number of early stage startups and established
companies in the LA area and beyond including: Rent.com, RedEnvelope.com,
ThisNext.com, Gifts.com, eToys.com, Evo.com, Stamps.com, Citysearch.com,
Shutterstock.com, and more.

We help connect students with post-secondary schools, colleges, and
universities, and we have fun building services with many cool technologies
like:

- Amazon AWS/EC2
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Perl
- Apache/mod_perl
- MySQL
- Catalyst
- Template Toolkit
- Moose
- memcached
- Puppet
- and many more...

You don't have to know all of these, but you do need to know Perl, and know
it well.

Campus Explorer is VC funded and offers salary, equity, and benefits in
addition to the enjoyable working environment, great co-workers, flexible
hours, and cool technology.

We prefer candidates who can commute to Santa Monica regularly, but are
open to other candidates who have successful telecommuting experience.

Required skills:
Advanced Perl, reasonable SQL, general hard core software development, and
decent Linux system administration.
