Who is Kareo?

We are Kareo (www.kareo.com), a small and fast growing software company
based in Irvine, less than 2 miles from the beach. Our cloud-based software
powers thousands of medical practices in the U.S. We’re leading our
industry in the shift from traditional software to cloud computing (a.k.a.
Software-as-a-Service) and helping doctors get paid by taking today’s
complex healthcare system and making it easy.
 
In the last two years, we have doubled our customers and revenue and we’re
on track to double again this year! We were just recently included on Inc.
magazine’s Inc. 500|5000, an exclusive ranking of the nation’s fastest
growing private companies. Kareo outranked all other medical office
software companies, ranked in the top 100 of all Health companies at No.
74, and placed among the top 20% of companies overall.
 
What We Need?

Multifaceted enterprise infrastructure engineering talent, the kind that
other large web providers wish they could keep. Eat, live, and breathe
continuous delivery and process automation.
 
Must have a passion for DevOps, capable of meeting in the middle between
operations and development, have an overwhelming need to conquer the world
one bit at a time, and not afraid to reach new levels of awesomeness.

love Ruby, Puppet, Chef, PERL, Python, Jython, Bash, Java, .NET,
Powershell.
 • Enjoy mixing it up across different operating systems, storage, and
network technologies. We believe Windows and Linux can co-exist
harmoniously, as long as both are secure.
 • Work hard to keep Kareo’s infrastructure up 99.9% of the time, and for
you overachievers we have a special prize just for you.
 • Collaborating with others as we attempt to build another deathstar,
well, maybe that was a bit over the top but that’s how we expect you to
roll.

 • Multiple years working for enterprise corporations, preferably SaaS, in

What We Will Deliver in Return:

 • Company sponsored yoga sessions (twice weekly)
 • Monthly mixer meetings, that are FUN!
