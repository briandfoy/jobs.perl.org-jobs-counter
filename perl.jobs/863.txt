Job title: Rebranding Perl/PHP Source Code

Company name: CommerceStore.com

Location: United States, Ok, Tulsa

Pay rate: $25-$35/hr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Until Completion (1-2 wks)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have just purchased the Mark Joyner Farewell package, and need help
rebranding the software. This package is big: 

http://tgl.net/jv/ 

Click on "Software List" at the top left for more details. 

I do not expect it to be "hard", but it could be a lot of work ... there
are quite a few packages in this software. 

Rate is somewhat negotiable - what can you do for me and how quickly can we
get it done?

Specificly, I need help with "rebranding" all the software. Skills needed
include: 

* Perl 
* PHP 
* MySQL 
* Some MFC (optional)

There is some Windows MFC code as well.  Ability to work in that
environment is a "plus".

You will need the ability to ssh over a broadband connection (cable modem,
DSL, T1, etc) into servers for work on the Perl/PHP code. 

I will provide: 
-- dedicated Linux server access 
-- the new name of the program 
-- Copyright information 
-- Graphics, if requested / required 
-- other information, as may be required per piece. 

I must wait for the CD's to arrive before starting the project, I expect
them to be in by Monday, April 28th. 

This needs to be completed as soon as possible, because there are multiple
competitors doing the same thing with their copies of the code. Time to
market is critical. 

I am competent in the above technologies, so you will not be working alone
or doing everything. 

As per Mark Joyner's terms and conditions, I must have a signed NDA before
work can start on the project, unless you have purchased your own copy in
which case we will need to negotiate a fair non-compete agreement (I simply
don't want someone to charge me for the rebranding, do a couple of
modifications, and release it on their own). 

Please do not reply if NDA/Non-Compete is a problem.

Required skills:
Perl
PHP
MySQL
ssh / comfortable in shell environment

Desired skills: Microsoft Visual C++
