Company name: 123Doc Medical Courses

Location: United Kingdom, London, London

Pay rate: £20K-£25K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
123Doc Medical Courses is an online education company providing online and
interactive revision, study, exams, videos, jobs and many other services
for doctors.

We are seeking a PERL web developer to join our IT team.

Extensive knowledge and experience of Perl (including object oriented
Perl), a strong knowledge of SQL (preferably including exposure to MySQL)
and the Web Development process are essential.

Knowledge of PHP is desirable and an understanding of HTML, CSS and
JavaScript is desirable; knowledge of the Template Toolkit Perl module
would also be helpful but is not essential.  A background in Linux (and
Systems Administration) would be an advantage.	A high standard of written
English is required.

The position will require you to work both autonomously and with others,
under a varying degree of supervision within a small team.

The candidate will have a track record of maintaining their code with
meaningful comments and keeping well-written documentation.

Although 123Doc specialises in providing resources for doctors, no previous
medical knowledge is required.

Applicants should send a covering letter by email to russell@123doc.com ,
enclosing a CV and citing at least two referees.

Selection will be by interview, at which candidates may be asked to provide
examples of their code.

Required skills:
Extensive knowledge and experience of Perl (including object oriented

and the Web Development process are essential.

Desired skills:
Knowledge of PHP is desirable and an understanding of HTML, CSS and
