Willing to Relocate!!

I Have about 7 years of web development/documentation
experience. It includes the use of Perl, Server-side
Java, Javascript, Mason, Postresql, Oracle, and 
PHP. I run my own network and server locally at my
home. So perl and web development are more than a
means to make money for me..its a hobby that I've 
enjoyed for years. Most of my development has been in
a Unix/Linux environment.


I have over 6 years of systems Perl5-objects,PHP,
pl/sql, Postgresql and oracle experience. In addition,
I have developed highly visible websites
that can attest to my abilities. In addition, I have
done extensive work with Server-side Java with MTV,
Sony and Pfizer

I'm currently working off-site for Digital Color
Imaging Inc. Located in Pennsauken NJ. Using Mod-Perl,
Mason, Apache, Linux, Postgres, Perl and Javascript we
are implementing and supporting a huge
image-repository for Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and
Reckitt Benckiser. 

I am a systems Developer/Architect/Project
Manager/documentator with over 6 years of hardcore Web
and systems Development experience. 
I have designed and implemented e-commerce,media and
administrative sites for various companies.
Those company include MTVi, Sony, UsaNetworks, SCIFI
Channel and Register.com. 
I bring a highly scalable and object oriented style
and thourough work ethic to every project that I've
worked on. 
Additionally, I have extensive experience with Tomcat
server(Java Servlets/Server-Side),
Perl5(Objects,templating),
 C++(Standard Template Library) and PHP3/4 all using
an Oracle or Postgresql backend.

I was most recently employed as Senior Programmer
Analyst at Usa Interactive(NYC) where I mentored 4
other developers. In addition, I was the Technical
Lead
for Digital Color Image(Pennsauken NJ) for 2 years. I
understand and know how to implement full project life
cycle development, testing, 
roll-out/deployment, versioning, project management,
and quality control.

My resume can be submitted upon request.
Sincerely,
Craig L. McMillon
