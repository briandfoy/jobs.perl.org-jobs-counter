Job title: Creative Perl/Network/Linux Role

Company name: SHOWstudio

Location: United Kingdom, London, London

Pay rate: To be negotiated

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
SHOWstudio is looking for someone to manage and run our techical set up,
mainly involving live fashion events via webcam, streaming audio, video
etc. Our existing set up is Perl based running on Linux Servers.

SHOWstudio is a small not-for-profit arts/design/fashion initiative and we
have limited resources. The ideal person will be happy to work within this
environment, and also not be motivated purely by financial gain. We are
also only a small organisation, and therefore a willingness to be flexible
is needed.

Note this job will inherently require sys-admining type skills, but is not
a 24hr style sys-admin/support job.

This is a unique creative opportunity and the ideal person will pioneer new
ideas and not just expect to follow orders. Also, the role involves non
stop liasing with 'creatives' and so ability to talk technical matters in
simple English and put up with people who don't understand technology is a
must!

Required skills:
Perl
Linux System Admin
Network skills, eg  installing web cams and equipment at different
locations to deadlines

Desired skills:
Understanding of video streaming technologies
Interest in wireless and mobile technologies
