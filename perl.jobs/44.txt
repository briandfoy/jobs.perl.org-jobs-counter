Subject: [Perl Jobs] Seeking Perl development job in Chicago area, IL
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: eschmidt@enteract.com (Eric Schmidt)

Hello,
	I am a very diligent, dedicated coder seeking a 
perl development job in Illinois.  Some of my most recent 
projects include:

Web-based interfaces for a MySQL server that I run from home
 - a logging form (logs APM switch issues) made for the 
   NMC (Network Monitoring Center) at my current job
 - personal programs such as address books and calendars

A program that mimicks the telnet client

and I'm currently working on my own ftp client which will 
be written in both C and Perl.

All of these applications are UNIX based.  I will consider 
any job offered, so feel free to contact me at the email 
address below.  My resume is available upon request as well.

Aside from that I am extremely friendly, outgoing, and willing 
to learn.  I like what I do and am a team player.  I hope to 
hear from you soon.  Thanks.
