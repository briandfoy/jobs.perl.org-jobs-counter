Subject: Senior Perl Expert Available - Boston-MA-US/Telecommute
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: uri@stemsystems.com (Uri Guttman)


I am a very experienced Perl developer looking for contract or permanent
opportunities.

My Perl skills include networking and communications, distributed
applications, client/servers, OO architecture and design, parsing and
data munging and Perl training. I have been hacking Perl for 9+ years
and developing systems for over 20 years. This is valuable experience
you will not find in many software engineers.

I live in Boston and can work anywhere in eastern MA. Telecommuting is
fine (I am finishing a project with a California group and my
development partner is in Minnesota) and some travel is possible.

I am offering a special initial consultation of two hours of project
analysis for only $100. I will go over your project needs with you and
write up a solution with high level design notes.

For more information on my skills and interests and my resume, go to
http://sysarch.com. For examples of my Perl design and code as well as
writing go to http://stemsystems.com.

Contact me at jobs@stemsystems.com and send in your project requirements.
