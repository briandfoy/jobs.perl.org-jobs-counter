Job title:
Part-Time Bugzilla/Perl Contractor, Telecommute

Company name: Everything Solved, Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Mountain View

Pay rate: $25-$35/hr USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
     Everything Solved, Inc. does professional development for large and
small companies around the world. We have lots of clients, we just need
more engineers!

    Most of our work is in Perl. The founder of Everything Solved is one of
the primary developers of Bugzilla, so we do a lot of Bugzilla
customizations. If you have experience working with (or customizing)
Bugzilla, that's a big plus. If you have no Bugzilla experience, there may
or may not be an unpaid training period, depending on the level of your
Perl skills.

     This job has no particular required schedule. You can work from home,
at whatever time you want, as long as your code is delivered on time. The
work isn't guaranteed to be any particular number of hours per week, but
it's unlikely to be more than 20 hours in the near future. You can take on
more or less work depending on your availability.

     As we expand more, if your code is of good quality, we will have more
and more work for you.

     All your work will be reviewed by a professional code reviewer with
extensive Perl experience before being submitted to any client. We require
that you be able to produce well-architected, readable code that can pass a
relatively strict review within a reasonable number of reviews.

Required skills: Perl, DBI, MySQL, HTML, CSS

Desired skills: Bugzilla, Template Toolkit
