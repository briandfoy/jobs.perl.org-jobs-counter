Job title: Senior Software Engineer in Test

Company name: Permabit

Internal ID: SRSET_PERL_ORG

Location: Cambridge MA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I am the first Senior Software Engineer in Test hired by Permabit, who is
looking for a second.  While the official job description does not make it
apparent, my experience thus far has involved a lot of perl.

The job is within walking distance of the Alewife T stop and the bicycle
path.  This means one can get here with or without a car.

Here is the official job posting
http://permabit.com/careers/senior-software-engineer-in-test-set/

There is also a Software Engineer in Test position for someone with less
experience.
---------------------------------------
Senior Software Engineer in Test (SET)
Permabit is a recognized leader in data efficiency technology.	We enable
OEMs to leverage their R&D investment, increase margin, accelerate time to
market and achieve competitive advantage.  Permabit Albireo software
massively improves performance and efficiency of data creation,
transmission and storage.  Solutions built with Albireo are being delivered
by leading hardware, software and service providers.

Permabit is seeking talented Software Engineers to accelerate the delivery
and improve the quality of all software developed at Permabit.	Do you
thrive on test-driven development?  Are you annoyed by manual processes
that could be automated? Do you love building robust and scalable test
automation frameworks?

At Permabit, SETs work on the “software behind the software” – the vast
array of tooling, frameworks, and automated tests that ensure our customers
receive the highest quality software.  Our infrastructure, and our
dedication to continually improving it, is essential to our ability to
innovate.

SETs work closely with product development engineers in small, agile
development teams.  Development activities performed by SETs include:

Enlarging the scope of our automated tests
Improving the efficiency of existing tests
Simplifying test development
Enhancing our build and release processes to increase responsiveness to
customer issues and requests
Inventing ways of simulating and verifying complex functionality (for
instance, simulating the IO response times of different sorts of Flash
arrays, or programmatically generating interesting workloads)
Finding ways to make better use of our array of test VMs running on
Amazon’s EC2 cloud or in our private cloud of performance-centric machines
Improving our ability to make detailed measurements of our sofware and feed
this back into our software design process
Refactoring product code so that it is more easily tested

Required skills:
Requirements
BS or MS degree in Computer Science (in lieu of degree, 4 years of relevant
working experience)
5 + years of relevant work experience
Strong programming skills in multiple languages, including Python, Perl, C,
C++ or Java
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
