Description:
We have an input file that has some URLs that we need to screen capture. We
have a script running but its not very efficient. Im looking for a
developer who can rewrite our image capture script. Here are the steps:

1. import first URL from csv file
2. Go to the URL using firefox
3. screen capture the image
4. modify the image printing onto it the date and time along with a field
from the input file. 
5. save the image to a directory
6. start over from step 1 above until complete.

The script will be run on a linux box or windows box either way and part of
your job is to install script and get it working correctly. Please email me
a bit about your skills and also how much you bid to do this project.
Please only bid if you have the time to start this project and finish it by
4/26. Thanks fellow Perl enthusiasts!
