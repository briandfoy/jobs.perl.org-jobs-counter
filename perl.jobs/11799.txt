Job title: Software and Data Specialist

Company name: Interhack

Location: Chicago, IL

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is an opportunity for a Perl hacker to stay close to the code and the
data while also advancing a career that goes far beyond Perl.  We're
hackers, and proudly so, but what we do is much, much more.  The context is
business and litigation, the objective is a correct answer to an important
question, and often the right tool is the Swiss Army Chainsaw.

With offices in Columbus and Chicago, Interhack has a national consulting
practice in need of a software and data specialist.  This is an opportunity
to for an ambitious person to apply computer science and information
technology to projects that matter.  If you're up for a challenge and are
looking to kickstart a rewarding career path, read on.
 
Success in the position will come from applying knowledge of software
development, data structures, and algorithms to opportunities that arise in
dispute resolution and information assurance. Datasets submitted for
analysis will include everything from unstructured application logs,
formatted output from domain specific tools, and text-based human-readable
reports material to litigation.  Deadlines are tight and projects are
numerous; the Specialist will need to work in tight iterations of problem
assessment, data assessment, software development, testing, and
reporting—keeping documentation current through the entire process.

Reporting to the firm’s practice leader and working under the supervision
of domain experts in service delivery, technical methods, and tools,
technicians provide basic technical services in support of the delivery of
service to Interhack’s client base.

Responsibilities include:
Planning a day based on tasks assigned across a variety of projects;
Accurate and complete reporting of time and activity;
Accurate and complete use of processes and documentation;
Execution of scripted procedures and use of tools to acquire data for
analysis;
Packing and maintaining standardized kits for data acquisition and system
interface;
Production: loading, unloading, consolidating, and releasing datasets per
written procedures and verbal instructions; and
Development of documentation in connection with engagements.

Required skills:
You must be comfortable working in a formal environment, with oversight,
inspection, and ongoing training in matters well beyond software and data. 
Interhack is a service organization and you must be able and willing to
learn the brand and to deliver on the brand promise.

Skills needed:
Skillful use of multiple programming languages and paradigms including but
not limited to Perl, Python, and Java;
Understanding of network-centric architecture and software;
Understanding of GNU/Linux or other Unix systems, as well as data from
other systems, including EBCDIC-based systems;
Excellent business communication skills in person, by phone, and in
writing;
Comfort with technology including custom internal systems and cloud-based
applications;
Rapid assimilation of information, including ambiguous, incomplete, and
complex information;
Flexibility and resilience in the face of tight deadlines and fluid
situations;
User-level competence with the LaTeX document preparation system,
collaborative office applications such as Google Apps; and
Willingness to travel, potentially on short notice.

Desired skills:
Previous training and experience in information assurance, forensic
computing, or litigation may be helpful.
