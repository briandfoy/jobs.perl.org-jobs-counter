The project is a volunteer based project but we do have a small budget
available for someone who can jump in and get the client side problems
fixed at a pay rate of $25/hr. When the project extends to other states the
development and maintenance of State Specific import routines, often
substantial would be paid work. However, most of the ongoing development
and maintenance is a volunteer effort. 

This project would be ideal either as an internship opportunity or for an
experienced programmer who would like to volunteer for the Libertarian
Party. 

This position requires that you be a Registered Voter in the United States.
Membership in and registration affiliation to the Libertarian Party is
preferred.
