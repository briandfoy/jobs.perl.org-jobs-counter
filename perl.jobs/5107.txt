Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: TEK Systems

Location: United States, Tx, Austin

Pay rate: $DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Our client is looking for a full-time, direct hire Perl developer. 

Our client helps automotive leaders design and implement successful
business initiatives that solve problems caused by the diversity,
complexity, and disparity of their business systems. Working together
seamlessly, the InfoIQSM Solutions provide complete information management
capabilities to market-leading OEMs, portals, retail marketing operators,
and major dealer groups. Available through an application service provider
(ASP) model, InfoIQ Solutions collect and transform automotive industry
data designed expressly to increase the sale of new and used vehicles,
service and parts.

Description

The position is a mid level development position that works primarily in
design, coding, testing, and supporting software products and related
materials to meet customer requirements. 50-60 percent Perl development,
20-25 percent Java development. As to the day-to-day activities... this
will probably be about half code maintenance - half new development... with
virtually all of the maintenance being on the Perl side (although there is
still some new Perl work going on).  Whereas, the Java work will lean much
more towards new development.
