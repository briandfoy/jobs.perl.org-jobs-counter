Job title: Perl Engineer

Company name: Shutterstock

Location: New York, NY

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Shutterstock loves Perl.  We're a stock photo and video company, and we see
ourselves at the forefront of technology and research.	We do fascinating
things with search, discovery, recommendation engines, and scalability. 
We're looking for great Perl engineers to help us continue to be a leader
in our industry.
 
We're an agile shop, and we focus on close interaction, so you'll have to
be local to the New York area.	But if you're awesome enough, we'll move
you out here!
 
If that's not enough, check out these other perks:
 
- All the hardware you want:  Our philosophy is that hardware is cheap
compared to your time.	If you think it will increase your productivity,
we'll buy it for you.
- Professional development:  The more you know, the more valuable you are
to us.	So you'll get any tech book you want, and we'll reimburse your
tuition for classes.
- Lots of free goodies: Breakfast, fruit, pizza on Fridays, and even
massages.
 
We're looking for experienced Perl programmers who can get complicated
projects done quickly and independently. You should have a keen interest in
and enthusiasm for high-traffic web sites and all the excitement they
offer: optimization, load balancing, redundancy, fail over, tiered
architectures, etc.
 
We've got a strong commitment to open source software.	Check out our team
members' projects at http://code.shutterstock.com.
