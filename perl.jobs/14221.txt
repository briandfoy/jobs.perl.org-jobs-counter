Job title: Sr Software Engineer - Contract / Contract-to-Hire

Company name: TigerLead Division - Move Sales, Inc

Location: West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months +

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for a sharp and motivated software engineer to lead the
design, development, and delivery of a critical system that will streamline
how we manage our inventory of real-estate leads. We expect that the core
effort will require approximately 3 months to complete.

TigerLead is dedicated to helping home buyers and sellers to connect with
the best realtors. This is an exciting opportunity to work in a
startup-like atmosphere within a small but profitable and fast-growing
division of Move Inc (located in West Los Angeles), where your
contributions will make a direct impact on clients' success. Our
engineering team is a fun and passionate group.

We do agile development based on Scrum, so experience with agile practices,
quick iterations, and integration of regular feedback is required. As a
result, an ability to communicate directly and effectively with
stakeholders (both verbally and in writing) to be able to define and
clarify requirements is essential.

Our engineering team is also growing, so while this is a contract position
targeted at the completion of a specific project, if you have the same
drive for results that we do and we enjoy working together, we will
consider making a full-time offer at the conclusion of the contract.


*** Responsibilities ***

- Quickly absorb existing requirements and understand the context in which
the system is to be built.
- Communicate proactively with stakeholders to clarify requirements and
translate them into functional/technical specs, and to integrate their
feedback.
- Work under the direction of one of our senior developers, and in
collaboration with a small supporting team to rapidly design, build, and
iterate upon a Minimum Viable Product.
- Deliver clean, functional, modular, well-documented, and well-tested code
in accordance with requirements.
- Adopt a service-oriented design where appropriate.
- Take ownership of the project and ensure stakeholder satisfaction.


*** Location and Hours ***

Preference will be given to candidates who can work in our Los Angeles
office (at 1554 S. Sepulveda Blvd), but we will consider telework for the
right candidate. This is a full-time (40 hours per week M-F) position for
the duration of the contract, and we will need your work hours to overlap
with 10am-4pm PST.


*** Additional Benefits ***

- A kitchen stocked with snacks, energy drinks, and more.
- A dog-friendly environment.
- Sharp coworkers, including Tim Bunce who has been working with the team
for several years and recommends this opportunity.
- A prime location just off the 405 in West LA, with several food trucks
typically available everyday.

Required skills:
- Senior level software engineer, with 5+ years of experience.
- Able to hit the ground running within a Linux/Perl environment (CentOS,
Apache/Nginx, PostgreSQL, Perl, Varnish, Elasticsearch, etc).
- Able to architect and implement solutions to complex problems on large,
scalable systems.
- Extensive prior experience building MVPs and iterating against them.
- Strong background in OOP, MVC design, and SOA / Web Services. In
particular, experience with Perl frameworks (such as Catalyst or
Mojolicious), DBIx::Class, and Moose is very desirable.
- Excellent SQL skills, PostgreSQL preferred.
- HTML and CSS skills to create web templates.
- Experience with JavaScript (jQuery) and AJAX.
- Solid grasp of source code management fundamentals (we use git and
GitHub).
- Enjoy collaborating with others, though you will be the primary developer
on this project.
- Team-first attitude, excellent communication and interpersonal skills.
