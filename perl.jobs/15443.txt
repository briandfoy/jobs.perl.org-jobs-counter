Job title: Linux System Admin/Developer

Company name: Blosm

Location: Telecommute | NYC

Pay rate: 40-70 USD

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for a long-term placement to join our R&D team of 10Xers,
and help us scale up our SaaS market analytics system. 

We already have a
long list of desired improvements to improve our monitoring and reporting
about system/client usage. That also includes some upgrades to our nightly
build and test framework. We want someone to help us come up with new ideas
of how to do things better.

All development is on Linux. We provide a
full, hosted dev environment. We use a lot of open-source software, and
managing these existing systems is core. Also, we never use anything
out-of-the-box, making this a developer position.

Many of our existing
systems are in Perl. You MUST know at least rudimentary Perl and Python,
and at least be willing to become quite good at both. Practically all of
our systems have both a Web and a command-line interface, so both HTML and
Bash are also essential.

This role requires daily calls to sync up on
progress. Please specify in Easter Standard Time, what hours you would be
available for phone calls. There must be an overlap of at least 4 hours in
10am-6pm EST.

We require at least two regularly scheduled "stand-up" calls
per week, with a day between. We can do any times 10:30-6pm  M-F. Tickets
and time are tracked in our tracking system.

The team is a mix of
full-time and freelancers. We care about finding the absolute best people
much more than where they live. People in North America are preferred
because it helps keep the team tight-knit, and because we do get together a
few times a year. We do quarterly "bDays" where we get together to plan and
share info with each other. 

We look forward to meeting you.

Desired skills:
Perl, Python, Linux (Fedora), CGroups, Virtualization, Email, HTML, Code
Testing, Unix User Account Management, Chroots, Web Scraping, Performance
Benchmarking, Debugging.
