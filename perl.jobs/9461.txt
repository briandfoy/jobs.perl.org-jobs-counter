environment.

At Fonality, we believe in promoting from within and investing in our
employees. We offer a very competitive compensation package and a
comprehensive health insurance package (medical, dental, and vision). New
employees are eligible for stock options after one year of employment. We
offer an anti-dress code environment.

With some of the smartest people in the telephony business working for us,
this is a great opportunity to jump onboard and work with people who are
passionate about what they do. Check us out at www.fonality.com.
