Job title: Condor Project Open Positions

Company name: UW-Madison Condor Project

Location: United States, Wisconsin, Madison

Pay rate: Varied 

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Condor Project, a cutting-edge distributed computing research project
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, doesn’t live in an ivory tower, but
produces working software used around the world by scientists and industry.
We’re hiring four positions:

1) A C/C++ programmer to help us develop Condor, a distributed resource
management system that lets users manage hundreds or thousands of jobs that
can be distributed across computers locally or across the world. We need
someone who enjoys systems-level programming. Most of our programming is
done on Linux, but we also developer for Windows and a variety of other
Unix flavors.

2) A Perl/shell programmer to help us build and package the VDT, a package
of complex “grid” software used as part of our Open Science Grid
collaboration. The VDT is is used by scientists around the world to
distribute their computations. OSG is a production grid that runs hundreds
of thousands of hours of computations daily. 

3) A Perl/shell programmer to help us build the Metronome build and test
software. We run a facility that allows software developers to build and
test their software on a wide variety of platforms. We manage the facility
with Condor (of course!), and there is a large infrastructure on top of
Condor to track the builds, tests, and platforms.

4) A system administrator to help us maintain our systems. We deploy Condor
in our department and across campus on thousands of computers. We need
system administrators that feel as comfortable debugging a broken OS
installation as they do purchasing large quantities of hardware. 


Required skills:
C/C++
Perl
