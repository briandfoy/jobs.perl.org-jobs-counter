Job title: Perl Level IV Engineer

Company name: Prosper

Internal ID: Prosper

Location: United States, Utah, Provo

Pay rate: $100k+ USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are a highly profitable company with an older web based perl system that
has been poorly maintained.

We need three or four excellent engineers who can hit the ground running to
help us refactor the code base into a stable and extensible framework.

From there, the sky is the limit. Must be self motivated and able to think
outside of the box.

And understanding of MVC will be helpful. Solid unix skills are a must.

Agile development skills are essential as is the desire to use components
instead of writing everything from scratch.

If you are a rock star, telecommuting is certainly an option.

Required skills:
Perl
A working knowledge of CPAN
GNU/Linux
Subversion
Catalyst/Maypole etc
