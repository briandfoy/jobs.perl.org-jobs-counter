Description:
The candidate will utilize existing, and develop as needed, software and
hardware infrastructure to support the ocean sciences program developments
of the Caro-COOPS (Carolinas Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction System
http://carocoops.org) , SEACOOS (Southeast Atlantic Ocean Observing System
http://seacoos.org ) and larger national and international ocean observing
systems by extension.  Development requires the ability to use Linux server
shell scripting and Perl for data processing, PHP for web pages and
SQL/PostgreSQL/PostGIS for data storage.

The position includes the following responsibilities:

* Data processing to and from server filesystems or databases.
* Discussion with users or technical community regarding requirements for
product development or services.
* Development, documentation and maintenance of products or services.

Looking for candidates who have an interest in ocean sciences and the use
of more traditional IT data management techniques as applied to more
research oriented observing systems and data.  The candidate should be
self-motivated and interested in learning from and contributing back to the
ocean sciences data management and research communities.

The candidate will have a large amount of oversight until existing
development and work processes have been learned.  The candidate will
continue to be directed until aware of the current user/community needs and
able to utilize or develop solutions independently. 


Required skills:
Bachelor's degree in computer science, electrical and/or computer
engineering or related field and six (6) years relevant experience
experience or Master's degree and four (4) years relevant experience or
equivalent. Knowledge of Linux operating system (or UNIX), Perl language
(or Python, Java, C, or C++), PostgreSQL relational database (or Oracle,
SQL Server), and PHP web language (or JSP or ASP).

Development is mostly within a Linux server environment requiring candidate
to be proficient and comfortable working in this type of environment which
is mostly command line interface oriented.  The candidate may also be
moving between several concurrent work tasks budgeting time as needed, and
will need to communicate well, both verbally and written, with other
developers and users.
