Job title: Highlight phrases in text

Company name: CogMedia

Location: Canada, Quebec

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Onsite: no

Description:
What I need is to take a text (source.txt) and a file (phrases.txt) and
create output that highlight the phrase.txt found in source.txt. The
operation is very similar to somebody reading and highlighting what he
decides important for him when reading. Phrases.txt can contain words that
are not present in source.txt. 

Source.txt 
For the reasons given by Cory and McLachlin JJ., the
appellant, on the facts of this case, had a duty of care and a defence of
ex turpi causa was not open to him, be it viewed as such or as a matter of
public policy.	A restricted and more carefully circumscribed application
of the defence of ex turpi causa must lie in tort cases.  Its principle,
properly applied, has a valid and important role to play in limited
circumstances but it
is not appropriate to define exhaustively a priori the circumstances for
its application.
