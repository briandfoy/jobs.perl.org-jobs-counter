Job title: Scientific R&D Software Engineer

Company name: Film/Television Industry

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Client is a leading broadcast and entertainment company in Los Angeles. 
The position itself resides within a small R&D group that is separate from
your traditional IT group in a corporate environment.  This group
independently supports all the television, movie and other entities of the
company and focuses on technology research, doing ongoing testing,
evaluations, making recommendations on a more scientific basis that
eventually lead to the finished products.  This is a senior position, but
more focused on programming and “hands-on” involvement versus a
management-track role.	Advanced familiarity and interest within the Linux
community is an absolute must, as is Open Source.  Advanced degrees are
also very desirable.  One of the main projects they’re focused on currently
is movie encryption and digital cinema.  Additional responsibilities
include doing architecture, making presentations and communicating and
interfacing with top-level management.	

Required skills:
Perl experience absolutely required.  Also looking for 
current experience in designing and structuring databases, web
technologies, Linux, Unix and MySQL.  BS in Computer Science, Electrical
Engineering, Physics, Applied Mathematics and/or Computer Engineering is
required. 

Desired skills:
Minimum 3+ years experience developing multi-tier applications in a
business environment.  Proven understanding of high-level languages and
multi-threaded, object oriented programming. Knowledge of Software
Development Life Cycle methodologies.  Detailed knowledge of relational
database concepts and database management systems required.
