Description:
Validad is a Vienna based IT- & web-development forge. In our five years of

Germany,
Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Turkey and Brazil. 
Currently we are working on upscaling our existing developments to a new,
globally applicable SaaS-platform.

adaptability. Experience in multiple languages will count in your favour.

Desired skills:
★ Experience in development or high-performance web-based application
backends.
