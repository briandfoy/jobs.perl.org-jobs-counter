Job title: Perl Programmer

Company name: TEKSystems

Location: VA, Alexandria

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
TEKsystems has partnered with a large IT Government Integrator who supports
the Department of Justice to identify a Perl Programmer for a 6 month
contract to permanent opportunity in Alexandria, VA near Springfield Mall.

* Candidates must be able to pass a NACI clearance *

Experience required:
5 - 10 years of applicable experience
Experience with Perl 5.8 development in a production environment, OO Perl,
XML parsing/manipulation using Perl, Oracle 10G plus including PL/SQL
experience.
Experience with using Perl for doing data loads, string
parsing/manipulation and Linux required.

On this program, employees are always exposed to new cases, new projects,
technologies and challenges so the work stays fresh. Secondly, our customer
has been doing this work for 33 years so there is a great deal of stability
here. Thirdly, the work is interesting as a result of supporting national
cases that are frequently current news topics.

Business Challenge to Solve: Previously, the Department of Justice had to
manually pull data from case files and physically access court records in
order to prosecute cases. Currently, the DOJ attorneys and staff use
Automated Litigation Support Services to acquire, organize, analyze, and
present evidence. In effect, litigating attorneys can use professional
litigation support services and advanced tools to gather evidence and
information effectively to win lawsuits.

Why is position open?	The Government has on going requirements for
enhancements to the Automated Litigation Support Services.
