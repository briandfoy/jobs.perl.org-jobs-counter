Job title:
Senior web oriented  Perl developer for family notices website

Company name: iAnnounce

Location: United Kingdom

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We run the biggest online family announcement network in the UK, and we
need to expand our team.

There are a lot of interesting projects coming up (along with some dull
ones), so you will need to learn quickly, and be able to think for
yourself. Fast response is essential.

You would start with some of the smaller projects on a contract basis, with
the possibility of moving to full time employment if all works out.

We're looking for somebody who thinks about what they're doing - if you can
think of a better way, and can defend it, then we'll go with your way. Not
just a doer.

If you're on Perl Monks or CPAN, please send your nicks as well as your
real name.

You will need fluent English, your own development environment, almost
certainly Linux/*NIX based and a good internet connection for Skype calls.

Please also include your expected day rate in Euros.

We are UK based, but are very comfortable with tele-commuters.

Required skills:
 - Solid OO Perl experience (5 years +, but depends on experience)
 - Good web experience (the usual mod_perl, XHTML, CSS, JS)
 - XML
 - MySQL 
 - Linux

Desired skills:
Because there are a variety of projects, there are a variety of desired
skills - you are not expected to have all of these:
 - AJAX
 - VOIP
 - SMS gateways
 - Video on the web
 - Data analysis
 - Design
 - User flow analysis
