Job title: Network Specialist Needed

Company name: Jeff

Location: United States, Texas, Dallas

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: a few hours

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need a TCP/IP network expert to troublshoot a problem I have with a perl
client.  

I am connecting to a remote SSL servier (using a perl client) along with 80
other clients using TCP/IP. Once connected, I send a high volume of data (3
MB per second). The server has recently implemented(presumably on their
router) throttling, and has increased latency, and even drops packets. Now
I can only send/receive 100K/second before they drop my packets. 

Since my success is dependant on fast throughput, I need to find a solution
to this. 

Some of my competitors have found a workaround, and now experience 3
MB/Second, but I don't know how they accomplished this. I imagine they
discovered a way to change the priority or size of the packets, but I don't
know how. 


Thanks 


Required skills: TCP/IP, router experience, perl
