systems and will begin to refactor critical components over the next year.

Initially all candidates will go through a training phase where they will
be responsible for operational duties to familiarize themselves with
business processes and become aquanted with the systems in place. 
Candidates will then transition into working on new development projects,
and refactoring of existing legacy systems.
