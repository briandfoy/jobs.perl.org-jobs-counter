Job title: Perl Savvy Sys Admin

Company name: The Erlbaum Group, LLC

Internal ID: sysadmin

Location: United States, NY, New York

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
The Erlbaum Group is looking for a Linux Systems Administrator with a
penchant for Perl.  If you love UNIX systems, and your favorite Swiss army
chainsaw is Perl-flavored, you’re our guy.  Or gal.

Your job would be to own all the admin responsibilities for the company. 
This includes maintaining two internal servers, outsourced Exchange hosting
relationship, and maintenance and support for all client servers.  Also,
your help would be invaluable in support of software development efforts,
including setting up development and testing servers, supporting
programmers, etc.

If you have the chops, you would be regularly enlisted to throw into the
Perl web development efforts on various projects.  Possibly as much as 50%
of your job might be Perl hacking – maintaining existing code and
developing new features.

We’re a small firm, specializing in Perl (and open-source) based
development.  Although the company is small, our clients are not.  You
would have a very important job with an opportunity to wear a lot of hats,
and get your hands into a lot of different things.  If you like small
companies, don’t mind hard work, and are a solver of problems, then this is
the job for you.


Required skills:
* Truly expert in administering UNIX and Linux servers.
* Expertise in all things TCP/IP.
* Ability to crimp Ethernet cables with teeth.
* SSHd, QMail, Apache, Bind, NFS, IPTables, etc.
* Must have warm acquaintanceship with up2date.
* CVS chops a must.
* Able to say a few kind words about Windows.
* Perl wrangling pants.  CPAN flavored.
* Seriously organized multitaskers only!


Desired skills:
* HTML, JavaScript
* Object-oriented Perl
* HTML::Template, CGI::Application
* MySQL, Solid SQL knowledge
* Perl monks preferred.
* CPAN authors treated as royalty.
