Job title: Perl & PHP e-commerce web developer

Company name: TrustCommerce

Internal ID: 42

Location: United States, CA, Pasadena

Pay rate: $40,000/yr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are seeking someone proficient in a wide variety of programming tools on
the UNIX platform for developing new and existing maintaining projects,
mostly web based.  The tools we use include Perl, PHP, Python, Java, C,
C++, Apache, bash, and ssh.  We have a strong commitment to open source &
free software and prefer someone who does as well.  We also prefer to work
quickly and efficiently for 8 hours and go home, rather than constantly
working overtime as is common in the industry.	You must be able to
communicate effectively (in email, on the phone, and in person) in order to
interact with our employees & customers to determine their needs and
diagnose problems.  We also require someone who is a "morning person" who
doesn't mind keeping a strict 8am - 5pm schedule.  We will require you to
relocate to the Los Angeles / Orange County area if you do not live here
already.

About us: We are a company based in Pasadena, CA.  Our business is
e-commerce & transaction processing.  We also do quite a bit of consulting
(web/application design as well as backend work), and also a bit of hosting
and security work.  We are small but expanding very rapidly; our
lean-and-mean approach to business has kept us alive and thriving while the
rest of the IT industry is experiencing major recession.

The salary is $40,000/yr plus bonuses.	Bonuses are assigned accord to an
incentive program which pays 5% of billed consulting jobs.  We typically
bill at $165/hr, so an average-sized project of 15 hours would pay a bonus
of $123.75.  Not all work is billable, but it would be fair to say that you
could expect bonuses in the range of $200 - $500 most months.

We will require a demonstration of your past work.  If you have worked on
an open source project that we can review this would be ideal.
