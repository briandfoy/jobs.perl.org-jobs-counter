Job title: Perl Contractor (various)

Company name: Phase N

Pay rate: Various

Travel: 0%

Length of employment: various

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for people who are interested in small to medium sized
chunks of consulting work.

This aren't full-time long-term, they represent various work that is
currently falling between the crack or isn't being done because the current
staff are overworked.

We aren't ready to hire a full timer yet, but we need people looking for
either some night-weekend work to supplement their income, or people
willing to do a couple of days work here and there, decent coders who are
still at uni, and so on.

Rates vary, but are mostly at good hourly rates, although because the work
originates in Australian dollars, people in high-price currencies such as
the UK may not see them as good as someone in Australia or another
lower-currency country.

As well as the immediate work, we'd also like to collect names of people
interested in this sort of thing in the future as additional work comes up.

Required skills:
Perl, obviously. The items of work immediately to hand that need doing
require 1) Template Toolkit, 2) Some light XML, FTP, DBI and 3) POE 4)
LWP/WebScraping/Exceptions

Absolutely every piece of work we possibly can is built in the form of
CPAN-compatible distributions, so if you are a CPAN author you should feel
absolutely at home. While the POD/test standards might be a little more lax
than CPAN would be, that varies.

Projects live in structured self-contained SVN repositories that generally
can auto-release once you are done.


Desired skills:
You probably need to be able to issue us invoices for the work, in
compliance with your local tax regulations.

If in Australia, this means you probably need an ABN.
