Job title: Cool Hackers Needed

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, Waltham

Pay rate: 40-90K

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're still on the hunt for mad cool folks!

At this point, I'm really looking for a couple of hard-core hackers-- i.e.
application infrastructure and performance engineers who can help us scale
from 1MM dynamic hits/day to 50MM dynamic hits/day, and love making code
beautiful. I'm also looking for other people, but right now, I'm
particularly focused on finding these folks.

Most folks here have to be in Boston, and I'd prefer you to be here; but if
you really are clearly *that* good and can prove it, I can imagine a
telecommuter working out for these core infrastructure/performance
positions.

So-- if you are a super-sweet perl hacker, send your resume in! You can
send it directly to me (see contact info below); I'm the Chief Software
Architect here, and I believe that hiring is one of the most important
things a company can do.

If your resume alone doesn't indicate that you're a totally kickass hacker,
you'll have a much better chance of getting a response if you attach a
solution to the following question:

--------
Given a string of arbitrary length, write a perl program that will print
out the palindrome(s) of longest length in the string. Assume there are no
special characters, so "!c aba c!" would be considered a palindrome; also,
in "abcbb", "bcb" would be considered a palindrome. Assume the string is
coming in via STDIN.

Discuss how you came up with your solution. Talk about what cases it works
well for, and what cases it doesn't work well for. Discuss
best-case/worst-case run-time orders (big-O notation) if you know what that
means; even better, provide proofs.

We'll be actually running your program against a set of test inputs, so
make sure it actually works!
-------


Required skills: Perl. & being cool. 

Desired skills:
A desire to fix the godawful mess that is healthcare in the U.S. Oh, and
Oracle, or something similar.
