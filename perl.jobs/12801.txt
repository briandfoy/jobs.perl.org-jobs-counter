Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Dobie Media, Inc

Internal ID: perljob

Location: Nashville, TN

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Onsite: yes

Description:
Dobie Media, a Nashville-based leader in the online event and entertainment
listings industry is looking for an experienced perl developer.

About the job:

We're searching for a perl programmer to work on our events aggregation
product. Our stack is perl via the catalyst framework, nginx, mysql, sphinx
for indexing, varnish for caching, and a few other odds and ends all
deployed in the cloud and project-managed in an agile(ish) way. Familiarity
with those systems - especially the catalyst framework - would obviously be
beneficial, but not necessary. We're really just looking for a great perl
dev who understands the importance of shipping code, and has the creativity
and drive to help us build a better platform.

The work environment at Dobie Media is casual, we offer flexible schedules,
and we have the utmost respect for work-life balance. In short, we like to
work hard and then kick you out of the office at a reasonable time. There
are no 50 or 60 hour work week expectations!

This position will begin as a contract position, but will convert to a
full-time role with benefits (health and paid vacation) no later than two
months.

If interested, please reply to this post with your resume and the best
times to contact you.

PLEASE DO NOT CALL OUR OFFICE ABOUT THIS JOB. While you may reach our
receptionist, the only guidance offered will be to reply to the job posting
via email.

About the company:

Dobie Media aggregates content so people can find out what is happening in
their area. We provide an events platform for online media companies. Our
clients range from small newspapers in rural communities, to television
stations in major markets, and some of the largest newspaper holding
companies in the United States. We have a small dedicated staff that has
built the company from the ground up, over our first five years of
operation.
