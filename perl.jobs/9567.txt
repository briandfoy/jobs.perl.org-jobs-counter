Job title: MAILING LIST PROGRAM EXTENSION

Pay rate: 15-20$/hr

Description:
What I need or require:

This project is to write extensions for Dadamail ( a mailing list program
). Dadamail is written in PERL with Mysql database support.

I am planning to make multiple offers on saleable items from a mailing
list,using either fax or email. each offer will consist of a templated
multi page document which will include a cover letter and contract offer. I
would like the program to auto populate the contract and offer letter .
Some basic mathematical calculations must be also be done in the cover
letter .

After the mail merge happens to create each unique document, it would then
automatically be faxed or emailed to a contact person. There also needs to
be a way of storing and tracking the offers because over time I will need
to make multiple follow up offers on any number of the original offers with
a way of adjusting the price by a fixed %. I'll need to be able to recall
any individual contract quickly if someone calls me to discuss it.

What I already have : I can provide you with an example contract with
fields to be populated.I have story board of documents to show what I want
the interface to look like. I can also give you the field names for the
databases.

Specific expertise/background that I am seeking:

PERL and MySQL knowledge .

Timeframe for delivery: 1 month

Required skills:
Perl
Mysql
