Description:
Developers are expected to have strong Perl skills, CGI/HTML experience,

automating file exchanges with other servers or write simple socket level
network
listeners to receive things like log messages and alarms (20%)

- This new position is to facilitate growth in the group.  There are
immediate
opportunities for the right candidate with leadership skills if they are so
inclined.

- The project is a web interface for managing Land Mobile Radio (LMR)
systems.
Essentially these are the radio systems you see the police, fire
departments, and
other public safety workers using every day.  Telecom experience is very
applicable.

- The application manages the LMR infrastructure, subscribers, system
alarms, and
security. The project provides a rich client interface using AJAX, CSS, and
DHTML.
The server runs Oracle on Linux. Pages are served up using Apache, Perl and
the
Template Toolkit.
