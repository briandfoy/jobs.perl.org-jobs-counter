Internal ID: [Job: Field Services Engineer]

Location: United States, CA, Palo Alto

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Are you a software engineer who loves working directly with customers to
solve problems, is always looking to improve things, and loves to be right
in the middle of what's going on? Do you love the cutting edge? Great!

Socialtext has an opening for a Field Services Engineer. This job includes
responsibilities in the following areas:

    * 50% Working with customers and product engineering to design, code,
and deploy field customizations of our software
    * 30% Planning, executing, and supporting enterprise deployments of our
appliances
    * 20% Helping triage, isolate and address onsite deployment issues
found by our customers

You'd be great at this job because:

    * You thrill at making customers swoon with excellently executed and
personable interaction - including throwing on your cape periodically to
find a quick fix for a critical problem.
    * Your excellent written communication skills help keep everyone on the
same page during the quick-paced field engineering projects
    * You love being presented with tough, high impact problems and finding
creative, clever solutions
    * You are fluent in geek-speak and normal language and translate
between them to help the product management team and other developers
understand and prioritize based on customer needs
    * You are very detail-oriented and skilled at identifying potential
pitfalls during project planning
    * You excel at juggling multiple projects and planning your work to
meet tough deadlines, even in a whirlwind of changing priorities
    * You're really good at working together with a team to make sure
customers' expectations are set and met consistently


Required skills:
We're really hoping to find someone with a good deal of experience with the
following:

    * Deploying debian-based appliances into large company data-centers
    * Creating and maintaining debian/rpm packages
    * Knowledge of a variety of server hardware
    * Writing object-oriented applications (we use perl)
    * System-administration type work

You want to work here because:

    * You have at least one blog and would love to work with a bunch of
internet rock stars to help shape the next evolutionary stage of social
software.
    * You think it's really cool to work for a very distributed company -
most of our employees work remotely and on very flexible schedules.
    * Helping people communicate more effectively and efficiently fires you
up.


Desired skills:
We'd also be thrilled to hear that you've done the following:

    * Participated in open source projects
    * Worked with various tools for online collaboration
    * Helped customers or clients troubleshoot issues over the phone
