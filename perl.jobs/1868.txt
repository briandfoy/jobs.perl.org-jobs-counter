Job title:
Director of Making Things Fast, Clean, and Scalable

Company name: athenahealth

Internal ID: athenahealth.2

Location: United States, MA, Waltham/Boston

Pay rate: $80K-$110K+, depending on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Rather than telling you what I think the ideal candidate for this position
looks like (degrees, years of experience, etc.), I'll just tell you the
sort of tasks I'd like the person in this position to execute:

-Create a generalized HTML form library with meta-validation rules that
"compile" down to validations that can be executed both client-side via
JavaScript and server-side if the JavaScript fails to load.

-Define a generic nightly script template, along with generic logging
facilities.

-Create a generic, elegant mechanism for doing Expedia-style
"wait-for-meta-refresh" web requests.

-Bulletproof the application from a data-integrity standpoint-- make sure
that all denormalizations are correct, and all constraints are satisfied.

-Migrate the application from perl 5.005 to perl 5.8 (or 6, if you think
it's better); migrate to Oracle 10g; move to the latest versions of
mod_proxy/mod_perl etc.

-Answer questions from developers on how to accomplish pseudo-tricky perl
functions, such as: "what's the best way to read data from a forked child?
does autoloading make sense in this situation? can XS help here?", and then
directing them to CPAN modules that solve the problem, or writing modules
yourself and then submitting them to CPAN.

-Manage a team of junior developers to help to retrofit our application
using these tools.

Because this bulletproofing/toolwriting process involves getting intimately
familiar with our codebase and working closely with many other developers,
I'm really looking for someone who is in Boston or willing to relocate
here. After we find someone to head up this effort, we may decide to
outsource pieces of this work.

A code sample of something you consider to be your best work would be
extremely helpful here.


Required skills:
Mad perl skills. Lots of experience writing web applications and doing
sysadmin-style scripting for server farms. Experience wrestling large
RDBMSs to the ground, ideally Oracle.
