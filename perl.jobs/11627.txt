Description:
Plain Black (plainblack.com) is hiring and we’re looking for a geek like
you. Not your average geek, but someone who wears GEEK as a badge. Someone
who breathes Perl, and drinks Linux. A geek who knows that there’s more you
can do with SSH than just open a terminal to a remote box. Someone who
believes that Internet access is not just a human right, but that it’s as
important as air, water, and shelter. If we’ve described you, then please
apply.

Required skills:
You must be able to:
-Work independently or as a member of a team.
-Be self-motivated.
-Write modern Perl, not chicken scratch Perl, and be able to explain the
difference.
-Use and abuse relational databases like MySQL.
-Be comfortable with common tools like Bash, Git, Nginx, Apache, and Vim.
-Know common web development technologies like Javascript, CSS, HTML.
-Prove U.S. Citizenship, as we do a lot of work for the Federal Government.

Desired skills:
It would be nice if you:
-Have experience with Perl web development including one or more of:
WebGUI, Plack, Catalyst, Dancer, or Mojolicious.
-Have experience with one or more modern Javascript frameworks like jQuery,
YUI, or Dojo.
-Live in Madison, or at least Wisconsin, or be willing to relocate.
Relocation expenses are available.

In return we’ll provide you with:
-Gainful employment with a salary of around $50,000 per year.
-100% fully paid medical and dental coverage.
-Profit sharing.
-A brand new high-end MacBook Pro.
-Ultra flexible paid time off, up to four weeks per year to start.
-An expense account.
-On the job training.
-An ultra-flexible work schedule.
-The freedom to telecommute from anywhere.
-Automatic annual cost of living increases.
