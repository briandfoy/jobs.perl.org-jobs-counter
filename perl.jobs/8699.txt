Job title: Sr. Perl (mod_perl/DBI/LAMP) Engineer

Company name: Silver Key

Internal ID: RA1285

Location: United States, CA, Redwood City

Pay rate: 100K++

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are a profitable private company looking to hire an experienced
programmer with expertise in various languages, who are gifted at solving
problems and deploying correct software, on-time.

Core duties involve assisting in the design and development of our
SOAP-based client across multiple languages.

The ideal candidate will have three or more years experience in software
development in a team environment and be familiar with producing and
shipping a product. We are not interested in candidates who will work
remotely.

Primary skills include strong experience in the following and a willingness
to learn others:

Perl (preferably including mod_perl and DBI, OO PERL is a must and primary
requirement) and Java or Windows Programming (C/C++, .NET, COM) or
Javascript / AJAX Development

Secondly, we have a need for people who can take on some specific tasks.
Solid experience in one (or more) of the following is a big plus, but not
necessary:

PHP, Unix (preferably Linux), Mason, SQL Experience

As important as the above are self-direction, flexibility and an interest
in being a "white hat." Due to the sensitive nature of our business,
applicants may have to undergo a background check.


Required skills: Perl, mod_perl, LAMP

Desired skills: PHP, Linux, Mason and SQL
