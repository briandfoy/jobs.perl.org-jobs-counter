Job title: Senior Perl Genius

Company name: Traveltek Ltd.

Internal ID: SDEV

Location: East Kilbride, United Kingdom

Pay rate: Dependant on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Traveltek is a worldwide leader in online travel solutions, from consumer
facing websites to  call center applications. We have customers big and
small, from single high street agencies to the largest travel companies in
the world. We handle millions of page views per month, deal with databases
that process tens of millions of rows per hour, and offer a great
environment for the technically inclined to challenge their abilities.

We're looking to add some new people to our already extensive team, and are
on the hunt for programmers who think they have what it takes to master
Perl. Perhaps you're already a Perl expert, or a PHP, Python or Ruby
programmer who is looking for a new challenge. We deal with more code (3
million lines and counting) and more data (hundreds of millions of rows)
then you've likely come across before, but if that sounds like fun, this is
the place for you.

Some knowledge of Linux or other flavour of UNIX would be a plus, as this
is what our whole platform runs on. Database experience is definitely a
must, MySQL especially. And as you will dealing with customers and we pride
ourselves on good service, good communication skills are key. Finally,
you'll need a willingness to learn. Almost everything we do is likely to be
new to you, and you should be ready for a challenge.

This position will either be based at our head office in East Kilbride,
near Glasgow. The successful candidate will benefit from a competitively
based salary.

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL

Desired skills:
- Apache
- Linux
- mod_perl
- XML
- Mojo
- Buzzword compliance
