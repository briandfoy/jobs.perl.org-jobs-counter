Description:
OO Perl Developer required in London to join a small but incredibly
successful investment banking software house who supply a sizable chunk of
the top tier investment banks and hedge funds. This company are recognised
as the world leader in their niche and they are looking for an experienced
Perl Developer to work on client driven development projects, enhancements
to existing systems and support of high-profile customers. You will be
involved in all aspects of the products from UI to server based
high-performance data processing systems. You will have the opportunity to
take an idea or request from initial conception through to delivery, and
will also participate in code reviews and strategy discussions, so you will
need the ability to confidently put forward your points of view but also
take on board other peoples’ ideas. If you are an experienced Perl
Developer who wants to work on cutting edge financial systems, apply now

The ideal candidate would be educated to degree level in a relevant
discipline with strong OO Perl development experience including good
knowledge of complex multi-dimensional data structures. You should have
strong SQL skills, ideally MySQL or PostgreSQL including query optimisation
and set-based data processing. Experience in the financial sector is by no
means essential. However, you will need to demonstrate the ability to
quickly pick up the terminology and concepts. Due to the nature of the
clients you will be dealing with you will need to be confident and
assertive, along with having excellent communication skills. You must have
a commitment to quality and as this is a relatively small company you will
also need to be flexible & pragmatic.

If you are looking for a technically challenging Perl development role
where you can get a foot in the door of the finance sector, please apply
now by sending your CV to sam.brown@engagepsg.co.uk for more details.
