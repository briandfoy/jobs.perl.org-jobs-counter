Job title: PERL programmer

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Market rate - GBP

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 12 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
The successful candidate would need to demonstrate they have successfully
delivered solutions using PERL.

The end customer (Tier 1 bank) needs someone to take ownership of their
Voice Management Tools strategy which will cover fault, performance,
configuration management and access control.

The Voice technology is a mix of Cisco Call Manager, Avaya, IPC Trader
Voice, Speakerbus, NICE, Verint. They are also currently deploying Cisco
CUBE session border controllers.

The current management tools are: Riverbed Clarus (monitors Cisco estate),
NetIQ (monitors Avaya estate), CA Spectrum (monitor all their data networks
and some of their voice estates (trader voice, voice recorders etc)

They need someone to focus on their overall voice strategy, but the initial
focus will be on one very specific requirement: Configuration compliance to
security standards. 

Currently use BMC Bladelogic Network Automation (BBNA) to audit the
configuration of their data network devices.

They have a network management framework that they have built in house
(from PERL scripts) to integrate all their different management systems.
That framework could easily be extended to gather the required
configuration data from the voice estate and present it in a way they can
audit it.

Required skills:
PERL

Preferably some experience of Network and Voice Management tools.
