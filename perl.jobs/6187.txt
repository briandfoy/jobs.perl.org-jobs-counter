Job title:
mod_perl/PostgreSQL programmer for freelance work

Company name: (self-employed)

Location: United States, GA, Atlanta

Pay rate: varies

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: varies

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am a PERL programmer in the Atlanta area. I am approaching a change in
life direction and need a contractor or two that can take care of some of
my clients.

One that will need immediate attention is http://www.coreatl.com

This site is based on the 'CORE' module that I have built in mod_perl 1.3
(on apache 1.3.7). The site has a fairly limited CMS system that should
remain intact. The database is PostgreSQL. The work, if good, can be
completely remote, but it must be professional and documented.

I have a number of other sites that I will be looking for someone to take
over in the future, but this is the first to go.

Required skills:
PERL, Template Toolkit familiarity, an equipped server to host mod_perl
apps and domains, extensive experience with mod_perl and Apache.
