Description:
EET is a small but growing educational technology company delivering
web-based learning and assessment products to college-level students and
instructors in the sciences. We are currently seeking a skilled and
adaptive contract programmer for 2 or 3 short-term projects with the
possibility of a longer-term engagement in the future. We offer a friendly,
informal environment, reasonably competitive rates, and an early-stage
opportunity to become a part of a leading organization in a rapidly
expanding industry. 

The ideal candidate will be highly adept in Perl and should have a strong
background in XML and in the practical application of XML-related
technologies (XSLT, XSL Schema). Prior experience with Altova Authentic
(esp. the Browser Edition) is a plus. Also very valuable are advanced
JavaScript skills as well as a solid knowledge of HTML and SQL. A high
level of comfort with Linux -- and open source platforms/tools in general
(CVS,Bugzilla,TWiki) -- is also desired. 

You must be able to write well-organized, well-commented, maintainable code
under the direction/review of one or more lead developers. You must be able
to identify, locate, and resolve code issues efficiently and be able to
work independently while adhering to specific guidelines. Special
consideration may be given to applicants with a background in advanced
mathematics, physics, or other sciences, however this is not a requirement.


You will be expected to work between 30 and 40 hours per week, most of it
on-site at our Central Square office in Cambridge, MA. We are just steps
from the Red Line and several bus routes. The hourly rate will be
commensurate with your experience/aptitude in the core requirements of the
job.
