Job title: Accountant

Pay rate: AU$

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hi All

I would like information to be scraped from an SWF website (from what I can
tell...but I am no expert, hence the post) and the resulting tables out put
to CSV. An example of the page can be found here:
https://www.tab.com.au/#!/nsw/racing/race-results-details/SEYMOUR/Races/1/3
1-Oct-2013

From this page I would like tables which show the win and place Tote Odds
for all the horses and the fixed odds just to the right of the tote odds,
including:
-  No.
-  TAB Sportsbet No
-  Runner(barrier)
-  Jockey/Trainer/Driver
-  Win (Tote Odds)
-  Place (Tote Odds)
-  Win (Fixed Odds)
-  Place (Fixed Odds)

I would also like the pools information:
-  Win
-  Place
-  Trifecta
-  Quinella
-  Exacta
-  Duet
-  First 4
-  Running Double

This will form a larger part of the program where another webpage is
scrapped...http://www.risa.com.au where I would like results and form
scraped.  I already have some code to obtain this info provided by a kind
person on PERL Monks. If you are interested in the whole job or just the
SWF part please let me know.

Also please provide an estimate of the amount you would like to be paid to
do the work. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Shaun
