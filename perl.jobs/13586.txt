Departmental Overview

The Information Security Office (ISO) coordinates the risk management
process for UC Berkeley's information systems and directs campus-wide
efforts to adequately secure institutional data.  The Information Security
Office is led by the Chief Information Security Officer and consists of two
teams, the Operations team and the Assessment team.  The Operations team,
System and Network Security (SNS), is responsible for implementing and
operating detection programs and security services for the campus, as well
as incident response and breach management.  The Assessment team is
responsible for managing the campus information system asset inventory and
overseeing compliance of campus information systems to internal and
external standards. 

The Information Security Office works closely with IT Policy to develop and
maintain the security policy framework for campus.  The ISO also
coordinates with other key groups involved in risk management for the
campus, and the ISO also coordinates with peers across higher education to
share information and solutions to information security challenges.

This position is part of the Security Operations team and reports to the
Operations manager.  The position is a one-year contract with the potential
to extend.

Responsibilities

The primary areas of focus for this position are tools development and
system integration to support security operations.  Security operations
generates and receives a large quantity of data about systems, networks,
and activities on these networked systems.  Bringing this data together to
identify actionable security events and generate relevant security metrics
is an interesting challenge we face.  This position will take a leading
role in designing and implementing new and better ways to integrate this
security data.	The position will also lead the development of tools to
increase overall team productivity.  A strong combination of problem
analysis and programming skills are required. The successful candidate must
be able to implement well-designed, modular systems using all usual best
practices of software development. As a member of System and Network
Security you will be part of growing team of campus security professionals
that operate and implement security services for the University of
California, Berkeley.

    Analyze internal and external data feeds and develop well-documented
and reliable data feeds
    Design efficient and cost-effective methods for normalizing and
combining event and network data
    Develop scripts and tools as needed by team members to support
operations and automate repetitive tasks
    Design, test and promote to production processes to create security
alerts and manage incident workflow
    Design and implement team and campus-facing tools

Required skills:
Exceptional system design and system integration experience and ability,
including dealing with large volumes of structured and semi-structured data

    Very strong programming skills in modern Perl
    Database experience in a modern relational database management system
(PostgreSQL strongly preferred)
    Web programming experience in Perl, including a strong understanding of
good security coding practices such as mitigating the OWASP top 10
    Shell scripting experience on UNIX
    Data modeling experience
    Database development experience, including database server-side
programming (i.e. writing stored procedure or function code), SQL
development, and using Perl to access databases
    Passion for information security
    Clear, concise writing ability

Desired skills:
Familiarity with configuring and programmatically interacting with ticket
tracking systems such as Request Tracker (RT)
    Catalyst MVC framework experience
    Reading knowledge of one or more other programming languages: Python,
PHP, Java, Ruby
