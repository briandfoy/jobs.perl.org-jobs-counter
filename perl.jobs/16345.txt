So don=E2=80=99t throw
out those wellies just yet. You=E2=80=99ll still be dealing with the British
weather! Albeit in beautiful Kent and if you like the big city vibe, London
is only 30mins away by train. So no worries, you can still have that pint
after work in the big smoke!

Desired skills:
2 years of Perl-based web development experience;
2 years of front-end web
development experience;
3 years professional experience;
Good knowledge of
modern Perl MVC web frameworks (Mojolicious, Catalyst);
Good MySQL
knowledge;

and continuous integration;
Experienced with SVN and Git;
Write & maintain
technical documentation;Strong attention to detail;
Excellent English
communication skills;
Passionate about learning new languages and
technologies.
