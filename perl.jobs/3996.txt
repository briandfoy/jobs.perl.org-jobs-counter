Job title: Object Oriented Perl Developer

Company name: ePrize

Location: United States, MI, Pleasant Ridge

Pay rate: Based on Experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are in search of Software Developers to join our team in Pleasant Ridge,
Michigan. As an ePrize software professional you will bring rockstar
capabilities to our delivery teams. Our developers design, code, test,
document, and support the ePrize technologies that drive our business.
ePrize software professionals command a challenging and non-traditional
position that demands a broad scope of knowledge and a high degree of
individual responsibility.  Enthusiasm for learning, aptitude for creative
problem solving, and a team oriented personality are key traits of a
successful ePrizer.

Required skills:
Technology is always changing and so are we. We currently use Perl, Java,
JavaScript, XML, XSLT, SOAP, XML-RPC, Web Services, and Flash. However,
ePrize software professionals are not hired based on their current skill
set but on their proven ability to master the technologies and practices
necessary to overdeliver success. If you are that go-to person relied upon
to get it done when it absolutely, positively, must be done right, we want
to talk to you. Helpful experience and knowledge include:

- Incredible coding skills in a modern programming language
- Extensive practical knowledge of web-related concepts and technologies
- Practical experience in object oriented concepts and technologies
- Practical experience and a belief in agile concepts such as test driven
development, iterative development, pair programming, and continuous
feedback
- Relational database programming and design
- Comfortable with Unix, Linux, and Object Oriented Perl
- Bachelor’s Degree from an accredited institution
- Excellent command of written and spoken English
