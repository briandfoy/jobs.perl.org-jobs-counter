Description:
123Doc Medical Courses is an online Education company providing online
courses and online videos to doctors. We are seeking a PERL programmer /
web developer to join our IT team.

The position requires the ability to work both autonomously and with
others, under a varying degree of supervision within a small team.

Although 123Doc specialises in providing resources for doctors, no previous
medical knowledge is required.
 
The candidate will have a track record of maintaining their code with
meaningful comments and keeping well-written documentation.

Applicants should send a covering letter by email to russell@123doc.com,
enclosing a CV and citing at least two referees.  Selection will be by
interview, at which candidates may be asked to provide examples of their
code.


Required skills:
Extensive knowledge and experience of Perl (including object oriented Perl)
and a strong knowledge of SQL (preferably including exposure to MySQL) are
essential.


Desired skills:
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and PHP is desirable; knowledge of
the Template Toolkit Perl module would also be helpful.  A background in
Unix / Linux would be an advantage.  A high standard of written English is
required.
