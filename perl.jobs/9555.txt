Description:
=head1 WHO WE ARE

We are Pobox.  (We are also Listbox).  We've been around since before the
Internet was cool, offering all kinds of email-related services.

We're a small company located in Center City Philadelphia.  It would be
awesome if you're in our neighborhood, but we'll consider telecommuting for
the right person.  It's a pretty comfortable and casual office, so don't
panic.

We like open source; it runs our business. As much as possible, we try to
write our code so that we can release it -- it's easier to write good code
when you know other people will see it.

Feel free to sign up for a trial account of either service to see more
about what we do.

...or ask about us on IRC.  You're on IRC, right?

=head1 WHO YOU ARE

You are a programmer who loves Perl.  You might likehorrible one-offs that
make your Python-loving friends wince once in a while, but mostly you like
writing well-designed, easy to maintain modern Perl programs.  You like
objects, and you build them with Moose.  You build your web services with
Catalyst and PSGI.  You publish code to the CPAN and other people use it.

Ideally, you're familiar with DBIx::Class, jQuery, Mason, and maybe Python
and PHP.  Ruby would be great, too.

=head1 WHAT'S THE JOB?

Some of it is maintenance: we have a big code base written across many
years. We want it to be smaller, more modern, and more cohesive.  Every
time you delete more code than you commit, an angel gets his wings.

Some of it is new development:	we have lots of ideas about where we want
to go next, and that means writing more, modern, maintainable systems. 
Lots of this
would be web and web services, lots would be email handling code, and there
are plenty of other problem domains, too.

Required skills:
Here's an unordered list of things you'd be working with:

  * Moose	  * Postfix	  * RoundCube
  * Catalyst	  * MySQL	  * Git
  * jQuery	  * SQLite	  * Lighttpd
  * Mason	  * Zope	  * Email::MIME::Kit
  * Python	  * FreeSide	  * Rx Schema
