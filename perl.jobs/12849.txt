Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Synacor

Location: Buffalo, NY

Pay rate: Based on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Want to create products that more than 30 million people use daily? Want to
solve unique, large scale, highly complex technical problems? You can help
build the next-generation of Synacor’s products and create web applications
that reach millions of people! 

Synacor is the country's leading provider of premium service delivery
platforms and private-label portals that enable Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) to easily bundle a wide variety of free and subscription-only
value-added services into their Internet offering. We are seeking
experienced, well-rounded and creative Perl Developers to join our growing
Buffalo team of over three hundred like-minded individuals.

Duties & Responsibilities:
•	Development, documentation, and maintenance of APIs used by
web-based applications in our portal and premium service platforms. 
•	Providing technical consultation and expertise to Product Managers
and other Synacor staff members.
•	Participating in technical planning and architectural exercises
•	Conducting peer reviews in an agile environment  
•	Other duties as assigned.

What we’ll bring to the table:
•	100% Company paid benefits (health, dental, vision) for all
employees and eligible dependents
•	Competitive compensation package, including stock option grants
(for eligible positions)
•	Award winning company culture with growth potential  
•	Casual dress and flexible environment 
•	Generous paid time off 
•	25 cent vending machines
•	Free Spot coffee, popcorn and cappuccino
•	Monthly company connections (get to know your co-workers)
•	The opportunity to make a difference! 

Synacor is not your typical 9 to 5 workplace.  Our award winning culture
doesn’t stop at flexible work hours and 25 cent vending machines.  Jeans
and t-shirts are typical office attire, even for the executives.  Teamwork
is an everyday occurrence, and is made easy with our new open workspaces. 
Our leadership team understands that the best results come from
collaboration, so we hire the best and brightest and then let them do what
they do best: create cutting-edge products and provide exemplary customer
service.  Synacor's headquarters is located along Buffalo's waterfront in
the Erie Basin Marina. Taking a few minutes to enjoy the serenity of nature
is as easy as walking 1,000 feet or so to the water. We even have a
lakefront gazebo with wi-fi connection!  And if that’s not enough, Synacor
pays 100% of health care premiums for employees AND dependents, offers
stock option participation, a healthy bonus potential and a very generous
paid time off policy. Working with some of the largest cable, telecom and
satellite providers, Synacor’s products and online services reach over 25
million high-speed Internet subscribers worldwide.  We are looking for
great people to join our team and be given the freedom to do the work they
were hired to do.

Required skills:
These Senior Developers will need to have extensive experience in Modern
Perl.

Required Skills/Background:
•	Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or the equivalent work
experience.
•	Three to five years experience in software or website development;
proven experience developing large-scale database-driven applications a
plus
