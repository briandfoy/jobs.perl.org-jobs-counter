Subject: [Perl Jobs] Expert Perl Developer seeking work - Bay Area / Telecommute
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: arjen@wiersma.org (Arjen Wiersma)

Hello,

My name is Arjen Wiersma and I am looking for a Perl Developer position. I am in search of a 
fast paced development company where my main focus can be in creating complex data 
munging systems with other aspects on performance optimizations, algorithm and data structure 
research.

I have been heavily involved in the data mining industry, particularly the ETL side, creating data 
extraction and transformation systems for a wide variety of systems. Within this position I have 
had grand exposure to database applications and thus the DBI and many other modules, just 
naming them all would make this e-mail really boring.

I also have good working knowledge of other programming languages like C++.

I am available for a fulltime / parttime position, preferably on-site. My resume can be visited at 
http://www.wiersma.org/resume.html

Kindest regards,

Arjen Wiersma
