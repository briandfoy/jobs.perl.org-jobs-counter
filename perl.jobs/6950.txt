Description:
If you know Perl, you've probably heard of ActivePerl, ActiveState's very
popular distribution of Perl. We're looking for an engineer who can become

serious C coding skills, and a willingness to dig deep to fix bugs in Perl
and CPAN modules in order to ensure a high quality product.

Millions of individuals and thousands of companies (including some BIG
mission-critical systems) will rely on your product on a daily basis. If
that kind of responsibility and influence makes you go "ooooh", read on:
