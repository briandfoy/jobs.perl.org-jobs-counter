The University of Wisconsin, Madison is looking for another programmer
for the Network Services Application Programming Group. We mostly do
system automation to scrape router configs and show output, simple web
apps to configure network gear, and a complex WebUI frontend to a Perl
backend running on a LAMP stack.  The app lets departments manage their
switches and routers.

We are mostly Perl with some bash, MySQL, RHEL/CentOS Linux, and
python.

Required skills:
DoIT Network Applications develops, maintains and operates the software
used by Network Services and campus Authorized Agents to automate,
configure, maintain and monitor the network. The software is mostly Perl,
MySQL and CGI, but we will consider developers with experience in other
languages. This is a senior position, and you must have experience creating
and maintaining multiple medium to large systems in the above environment.
The work hours are mostly flexible daytime, but some off hour support might
be required as noted in the job posting.

Desired skills:
Strong skills in Perl, and in the development of large systems with high
availability.  Moderate to strong skills in Linux or Unix, Apache, MySQL,
shell scripting, systems administration, and development of large systems
relied on by many users.
