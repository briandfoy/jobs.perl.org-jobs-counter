Job title: Software Development Manager

Company name: backcountry.com

Internal ID: ENG005

Location: United States, UT, Park City

Pay rate: BOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Backcountry.com is still on a growth curve somewhere between “wow!” and
“insane!”, and we need to fill in some structure for our engineering crew. 
We are looking for a Software Development Manager to bring some
methodology, unity, and love to our software development efforts.  This
person is a coach, there to make superstars of the 20+ engineers currently
working for backcountry.com.	We believe that success comes from bringing
the most value from the development teams, finding the right mix among them
for productivity, and prioritizing workloads along corporate goals with
motivation and peer-lead camaraderie.

The work environment here is incredible.  All the employees are very
passionate about their work, the gear, and the entire 'outdoor backcountry'
mentality.  Do you want a job where it's okay (almost encouraged) to get in
some fresh powder turns before work?  Do you want to work in a place where
you actually have an obligation to try out the latest rock-climbing gear or
snowboards?  Do you want to work with one of the tightest, friendliest,
hard-working, hard-playing software development crews in the Mountain West? 

Required skills:
The Software Development Manager will report directly to the Chief
Technology Officer and will have the following duties:
&#9679;Responsible for all software development hiring;
&#9679;Responsible for all team organization and personnel issues on web
application development teams;
&#9679;Responsible for primary interaction with department heads on
long-term development schedule;
&#9679;Responsible for interacting with Senior Project Manager, who also
reports to CTO;
&#9679;Responsible for interacting with Infrastructure Lead Manager, who
also reports to CTO;
&#9679;Responsible for ensuring documentation exists to permit ease of
application use internally;
&#9679;Responsible for instituting development practices that facilitate
incorporation of new engineers.


Desired skills:
Successful candidates will have strong backgrounds in website development,
team leadership, and exposure to open source environments.  Bonus points
for those with backgrounds in perl, as well as Agile Development
methodologies.
