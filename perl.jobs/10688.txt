Description:
Are you a senior level engineer that has a combination of software

testing methodologies.

In this position, you are the key to:
* Enhancing the delivery of both our kernel and Operating System offerings
to our servers.

* Evaluating system performance on a variety of hardware platforms and
under various workloads; developing and enhancing tools which can focus on
application performance bottlenecks with a view to eliminating them.

* Implementing SQA lifecycle end-to-end : from gathering functional
requirements, to the design and execution of automated, manual, and system
level tests.

The Kernel Verification Engineering team is responsible for the
verification of the proprietary Debian based Linux kernel and OS, which
handles the core functionality of more than 65,000 servers deployed across
the globe.  You will be an integral part of this core group within Akamai’s
