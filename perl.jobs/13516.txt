Job title: Senior Developer at Broadbean

Company name: Broadbean Technology Ltd

Location: Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: up to £60,000, depending on role

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
*** YOU MUST BE ELIGIBLE TO WORK IN THE UK ALREADY *** 
*** PLEASE, NO RECRUITERS ***

We're looking for various Senior Perl developers in our lovely Canary Wharf
office - whether you want to work in a more architectural role, or lead a
team, we're looking for great people. Guideline salary is on the higher end
of £40-£60k, and post-probation we offer (non-contractually) flexible
working and 50% telecommuting.

We're a small company (90 people in the UK), owned by a very big company,
and a great place to work. We've got a development team of 30 and are fully
committed to Perl, clearing our technical debt, and doing things the right
way moving forward...

Required skills:
You'll need to show proof of strong and "Modern" Perl - at least
familiarity with various testing modules, exposure to Moose would be
useful. The kind of person we're looking for will be able to explain in
detail how OO works in Perl, and take a guess at how Moose might be
implemented around that, if they don't already know.

Desired skills:
Exposure to continuous delivery and Agile SCRUM a plus.
