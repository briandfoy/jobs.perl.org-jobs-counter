Job title:
Contract/Part-Time Web Application Developer

Company name: Forge Technologies, Inc.

Location: United States, NY, Rochester

Pay rate: $10/hr to $35/hr DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Ongoing

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
Small consulting company is looking for a Web Application Developer.  The
pay rate is highly variable, as we are willing to look at applicants with a
wide range of experience.

The primary purpose of this position is to meet the budget of our major
client.  In accordance with that budget, we can initially only guarantee
around $400/week of work.  The items listed under "Required Skills" plus
Flash will be used toward this purpose.

The secondary purpose will be to assist on additional client work.  All
skills or experience that the applicant brings to the table will be helpful
in obtaining and completing those contracts.  The more you can do, the more
work we can give you.

Longevity is key.  We would rather work with someone who has other stuff
going and and may occasionally put us on hold than someone who will work
with us for three months and move on to other opportunities.  We are
maintaining and upgrading a fairly complex site and we don't want to
retrain someone every three months.

Preference will be given to applicants local to the Rochester, NY area. 
Overseas applicants are acceptable as long as they are able to do at least
25% of their work for us between 14:00 and 23:00 GMT.

1099 and W-2 are available.

Please send an e-mail with your resume, or with questions about the
position, or to request phone and fax numbers.
