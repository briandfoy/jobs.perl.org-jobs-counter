Open-Source Coders Unite!  Code perl at Ticketmaster!

Location: United States, CA, West Hollywood

Pay rate: Commensurate with Skills

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: full-time, regular-hire

Hours: Full time

Description:
Title:		Software Engineer
Location:	West Hollywood, CA 

The Company:

Ticketmaster is the world's leading ticketing company, providing ticket
sales and distribution through www.ticketmaster.com, one of the largest
e-commerce sites on the Internet; approximately 3,300 retail Ticket Center
outlets; 19 worldwide telephone call centers; and a broad online and
offline marketing network.  Ticketmaster serves more than 9,000 clients
worldwide across multiple event categories, providing exclusive ticketing
services for hundreds of leading arenas, stadiums, performing arts venues,
museums, and theaters, and sold 98 million tickets valued at $5 billion in
2004.  Ticketmaster is headquartered in West Hollywood, California and is
an operating business of IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ: IACI).

As many of you know, Ticketmaster is a big perl/mod_perl company. In fact,
some of you
may have read our job postings over the years. I want to point out that
there are some important changes in our "ideal" candidate for our current
openings. Ticketmaster has historically interviewed people based very much
on their perl expertise and that makes sense given our rapid growth and our
focus on perl. However, I have a number of new open positions for our core
engineering team where proficiency in perl is NOT a requirement.

Why are we doing this? To be totally honest, if you get a job here, you'll
be coding in perl. It's what we do. In order for this to work, we do expect
you to have a background in software development and object-oriented coding
skills. We'd also expect that you would feel very comfortable in a
linux/unix development world. The last and perhaps most important
requirement is "spark!" We're searching out those people who have the
unquenchable desire to absorb and learn. If you have this skill, you know
it. You're the one who just naturally rises to the top. Come to
Ticketmaster and we'll give you the environment where you can become an
uber-geek of perldom if that's what you really want!  If you're already a
perl wizard, well then "yeah!" of course we'd like to talk with you too!

You may be asking… is this an entry-level job? Not at all! We would like to
talk to senior and mid-level engineers who may have in the past worked in
C/C++ and other languages. We do like people who have a nice, broad
exposure to technologies so having some system administration experience is
a plus. Basically, we want the inquisitive people who love to look under
the hood and see how things are done.

Description:
Develop core back-end technologies for a leader in open-source,
high-volume, high-transaction web systems. As part of Ticketmaster product
development group, you will be responsible for integrating new
functionality into our existing code base, with an emphasis on perl
development, as well as aiding in the implementation of new core
technologies.

Essential Functions:

75%: Coding/Development: Primarily perl development in a Linux/UNIX
environment, however, C/C++ skills highly valued.

10%: Design: Design and architecture of solutions and enhancements to the
Ticketmaster.com code base.

15%: Troubleshooting: code review/debugging/troubleshooting

Required skills:
Education/Experience:

• 2+ years professional software engineering experience
• "Classic" engineering skills, ideally C/C++, other Object-oriented
development, perl, operating systems, etc.
• Strong Linux or Unix background
• Exposure to web architectures
• RDBMS experience

Desired skills:
Preferred Education/Experience/Knowledge:

• Perl!
• C/C++ programming for the web (specifically apache 2.0, apache API, C
module development)
• Significant RDMS systems (Oracle and mySQL ideal)
• Exposure to algorithm/data structure design and implementation
• Past experience as a system administrator
• Degree in Computer Science or Mathematics
