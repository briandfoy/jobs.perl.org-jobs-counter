Subject: Perl Programmer available for Contract/Full Time job
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: tkpZUpbc@spamhole.com (Jose Negron)

I'm a dedicated, serious programmer with 3+ years of experience in Internet development.  My skills include but not limited to:

Perl
PHP
CGI
C++
JavaScript
CSS

I know SQL and have experience in the following databases:
MySQL
PostGres 

I can hand code web sites and I run 4 of my own Linux servers. 

I can be described as a self-motivated, self-taught, enthusiastic and hard worker. I have ability to quickly learn and master programming languages and software applications.

I can work with Apache, Bind and Sendmail.

What I am looking for:

If you are located in Northern/Central New Jersey or NYC, and have a full time position, email me.

If you are anywhere else, I have experience as a freelance programmer and know how to give estimates and I'm good with deadlines.

Of course if you are anywhere else and you are looking to fill a full time position and I can telecommute, email me.

If you are interested, email me at tkpZUpbc@spamhole.com.  Of course this is not my real email address, this is to keep away spammers and I will give you my real address and a link to my resume.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
