Job title: Developer - Music and Metadata

Company name: OpenIMP

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: ₤35,000 - ₤50,000 per year

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
OpenIMP makes a platform to manage music and metadata. Working with
successful indie labels, major labels and distributors this software has
delivered millions of tracks to hundreds of music services around the
world. We also work directly with artists selling vinyl to the masses and
with industry groups defining standards for the digital supply chain.

We are based in East London and part of a group of companies all working
with music.We recently celebrated out 21st birthday and we're constantly
developing new and interesting ideas. We now have a vacancy for one
exceptional developer to take our platform and other music related projects
forward. An interest in music is desirable.

The team you'll be joining is small and in control of its own tools and
environment. You can deploy a build with a single command (as long as it
passes the test suite!)

The current code is a large set of persistent objects developed in modern
Perl, so there will be a lot of that, but experience as a professional OO
developer will be valued over any particular language as we look for any
good way to achieve results. The future holds APIs / Services and less
Perl. We would prefer someone who gets their hands dirty rather than
specialising in one thing. Years of experience are not necessary - someone
who is keen and has a can-do attitude is a priority.

This position is on site, telecommuting is not an option.
