Job title: Programmer, Bioinformatics

Company name: Genentech

Location: United States, CA, South San Francisco

Pay rate: competitive, experience driven

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Genentech's Bioinformatics department seeks an experienced software
engineer for a six month contract.  Modern Perl (or enlightened, or ...,
just not circa 1998) style is required.

We build tools to support our Research labs, collecting, storing,
massaging, and presenting information to computer-philes and -phobes.  We
have more to do than we can handle, you'll be pitching in.  Exactly what
you'd be doing will be a function of your skills and our needs, and will
probably vary a bit over the six month period.

You write tests, sometimes even before you write code.	You're not afraid
of a little SQL and are comfortable collaborating with folks who were born
speaking it.  You're familiar with things like Moose, Rose::DB::Object,
CGI::Application, NYTProf, and their ilk (or brethren) and more importantly
are excited about learning more about them and using them in real-world
work.  Smoothing out our in-house DPAN, setting up an automated build/smoke
system (we have Hudson handling Java builds already) and helping with some
other infrastructure stuff is also on the table.

You'll be working more-or-less full time in South San Fransisco, there's
the potential for a bit of telecommuting once things get running smoothly
but the bulk of the job is onsite.

Required skills:
Perl ("modern")
SQL, object relational mappers
Web application (CGI::Application, or similar)
CPAN, Module::Build, Dist::Zilla, etc....
Subversion
Linux
Software engineering in a professional environment.
Experience in bioinformatics, biology, or supporting scientists would be
helpful but is not required.

Desired skills:
Experience in bioinformatics, biology, or supporting scientists would be
helpful but is not required.
