Job title: Web Developer/Software Engineer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Location: Ladera Ranch, CA, United States

Pay rate: DOE, but usually $50K to $120K

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey develops cutting-edge software for web surveys and online
reports.  Sure, there are many ways to deploy simple web surveys, but we
focus on the most complex and tricky projects.	For example, we run
Fortune's Most Admired Company's survey, which goes out to thousands of
CEOs and Fortune 1000 board members.  We handle complex surveys that go out
to hundreds of doctors, with each one being paid a few hundred bucks to
take the survey.  So our software has to handle things like quotas, complex
branching, fraud detection, and many other things that simple tools don't
even think of doing.  We also need advanced tools that allow clients to
slice and dice the survey data we collect.  All of our software is
web-based, and we use it internally and license it via an SaaS model.

Note
that we aren't looking for people to program surveys (at least not with
this posting).	We already have another team that does survey programming
and works with market research clients on a daily basis.  This posting is
all about finding candidates to build the software that builds the surveys.
 We need programmers who can write clean, modular code to help us extend
and improve our software.  Now is a great time to join our team, since we
are in beta testing for a major new release of our software, and have a
backlog of new features to build.  We are using modern OO Perl code,
including Moose and Plack/PSGI. On the front-end, we use javascript,
including jQuery and the ExtJS library.

Experience with the technologies
we use is great, but more important that any particular skill is the
ability to learn quickly, figure things out on the fly, and make things
happen.  We are willing to train new team members as needed to fill in any
gaps in experience.

In addition, because we are a small team, team members
need to be able to wear many hats and fill in where needed.  Everyone helps
with client support, and some server administration and IT work comes up
from time to time as well, so adaptability and experience in these areas is
helpful as well.

We will consider a range of candidates, from entry-level
to experienced.

*About IntelliSurvey, Inc.*

We're a small, growing
company.  Currently we have about 70 employees, and we are planning to grow
significantly over the new few years.  We are funded entirely through
operating cash flow, however, so we are stable and free to grow at our own
pace.

We offer standard benefits such as a retirement plan with company
match, health and dental insurance, stock options, and so on.  Many of our
employees work remotely, so our offices in Ladera Ranch, CA are small, and
we can't offer a company cafeteria.  But we are very flexible and focus on
results rather than face time.	After initial training, our development
team members can have flexible work hours and some work from home
arrangements as well.

People who are self-starters and can work
independently will fit in well with our team.
