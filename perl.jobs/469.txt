Location: United States, California, Northridge

Pay rate: $50

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 hour

Hours: Flexible

Description:
Internet site using Perl Shopping Cart (RediCart v3.9.5 by Barry Robison
S-Mart Shopping Cart Script v1.9) which has been slightly modified for
custom features, simply needs to connect to a secure certificate to collect
customer credit card data.  Our programmer is admittedly weak in SSL
applications and claims the host is the problem, not the script.  Host
recently enabled error logs which may help.  The host won't look at 3rd
party scripts, both are pointing fingers at each other, I'm in the middle. 
I've been told this should not take more than an hour, therefore $50 will
be paid by your choice of PayPal (receiving fees at your expense) or
company check only if you accomplish the task.

Required skills: Knowledge of Perl

Desired skills:
Experience with secure certificates preferred.
