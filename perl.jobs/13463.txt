Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Adzuna

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: £45kish p.a. + stock options

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Adzuna are looking to recruit an experienced, professional perl developer
to support the ongoing development of our classifieds search engine.  This
is a great opportunity to join a rapidly-growing early stage startup where
you can make a difference.

You will need good communication skills and attention to detail as well as
strong technical ability. You will also need to understand the importance
of building structured code that is fast, scalable, reliable and robust. 
As part of a small but talented team you need to thrive working
independently and in a fast-moving, low-structure environment.

The kind of projects you will be working on include  new search features
and relevancy algorithms, partner xml feed integrations, APIs and ‘big
data’ analysis, administrative tools and  a variety of product features and
enhancements. Our systems have been with scalability in mind, so the
successful candidate must demonstrate experience and ability to write
scalable code to be run in distributed environments.

This is a full-time role at a market competitive salary plus stock options.


Location is at our office in Clapham.  Flexibility can be discussed.

To apply, please send your CV and covering email to jobs at adzuna.com
