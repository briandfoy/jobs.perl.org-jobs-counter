Job title: Unix Web Application Developer

Company name: Aaronsen Group, Ltd.

Internal ID: UL312

Location: United States, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh

Pay rate: $50k-$60k annually

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Full time position offered on-site in Pittsburgh for a web application
developer. This job involves primarily Perl on the FreeBSD operating
system, but also requires knowledge of PHP and C.  The individual chosen
will be in charge of maintaining an existing code base and implementing new
features (some small, some very large) in support of an educational
web-based email (similar to Hotmail) and web site management system
(similar to Geocities).

The requirement is for skilled *developers*, not just straight coders. This
means you have to be able to deal with other developers, who are human. 
You must also be able to work within a project framework, handle
interfaces, and deal with code documentation.  Most
importantly, you must understand that the job is not to code righteous
hacks, but to satisfy a client.

Required skills:
* Fluency in Perl 5 and Perl module use
* CGI programming
* PHP 4.0 knowledge
* C programming under Unix (with GCC/GDB)
* Thoroughness
* Persistence in solving problems
* Unix software installation and configuration

Desired skills:
* Bachelors degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience
* Systems administration experience
* Operational knowledge of HTML and Javascript
* Familiarity with MySQL programming via DBI
* Familiarity with LDAP, LDAP programming and Net::LDAP modules
* Skill with programming in Unix shells (Bourne types especially)
* Apache and Apache module programming experience
* Use of the Emacs editor
* CVS knowledge
