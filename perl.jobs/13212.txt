Job title: Web developer in fast growing startup

Company name: 15Gifts Ltd

Location: Brighton, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
15gifts creates and licenses intelligent decision engine software that can
be integrated to any eCommerce website to boost conversion rates and
generate invaluable consumer insights — helping customers quickly find
their ideal product.

We are an exciting company that's growing rapidly and we now work with some
of the biggest corporations and SME's in the UK including Virgin Media,
Orange, T-Mobile and News International.

The role we want to fill:

Following significant growth over the last six months, we are now looking
for another fantastic developer to join our fast growing team. Whilst the
company is based in Brighton (UK) we are mainly interested in finding
exceptional people, so we are open to remote working if you’re the ideal
candidate.

You should have experience developing software for large-scale web
projects, and should be comfortable with Linux servers, relational
databases, and dynamic web interfaces. You should be excellent at finding
creative solutions for challenging problems and write elegant code.

Our technology stack consists of nginx, Apache, mod_perl, Javascript and
MySQL. The code is based on our own mature web framework, and is managed by
Git. As our software continues to evolve and grow we want to remain
flexible with our stack, and you will have a unique chance to influence and
optimise this directly.

What we’d offer the successful candidate:

- A very competitive salary
- A hugely exciting opportunity to be an early employee in a fast growing
company
- The opportunity to work with exceptional level developers and designers
- A fun and creative work ethos
- The opportunity to input into all aspects of the business technology
- The time to create and develop your own ideas
- Your birthdays off work

Required skills:
- 4+ years experience creating large web projects with Perl or other
dynamic server-side language (Ruby, Python, PHP)
- 2+ years experience creating web interfaces with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery
- Database, application architecture, and software systems design
experience
- Fluent spoken and written English

Desired skills:
Experience in server set-up and administration (particularly Amazon EC2,
RDS, etc) is a plus, but not a requirement
