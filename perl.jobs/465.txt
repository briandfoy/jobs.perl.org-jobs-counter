Job title:
Wanted Perl mySQL programmer with a passion for documentary films.

Company name: e screening room

Location: United States, CA, San Rafael

Pay rate: volenteer

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 6 mnds

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
The e screening room http://escreeningroom.com	on-line website dedicated
to the documentary film. Here documentary fans can watch full length
unabridged films. If they like what they see they can buy a VHS copy for
home viewing.

The e screening room is dedicated to create a different distribution
channel for documentary films. 
Independent documentaries are born out of the passion –often compassion -
for the subject of the documentary. Often these documentaries are self
financed.  But there is little financial gain out of documentary film. As a
result, documentary producers get discouraged and often leave the field. We
think that’s a shame: to lose independent voice, is a loss for society as a
whole. At the e screening room we try to change that by creating a new
distribution channel for documentary film.

We are looking for someone with a passion for documentary films and
experience with Perl and MySQL database programming. The work will exist
out of customizing an existing public shopping engine
http://www.escreeningroom.com/store/ , and expand its capability to include
online data entry and create a number of online reports. This is a
voluntary position.

If this is something you feel as passionate about as we do, please send me
a few lines about your experience to:
