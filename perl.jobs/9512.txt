Job title: Perl Programmer

Company name: Madbury Web Development Ventures

Location: United States, NH, Durham

Pay rate: US$25 - $50 DOE 

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: some

Description:
Seeking part-time contract Perl programmer with substantial data
development and web development experience.  Successful candidate will work
on data development projects and and possibly some web development as well.
 Programming projects are diverse and may include web scrapers, end-user
facing web applications, data entry interfaces, unit tests, data scrubbing
/ loading scripts, and more.  Number of hours may vary based on
contractor's interest and company's available workload, but is likely to be
about 40 hours / month.

It's important that you be comfortable with a development process that
begins with a light spec and a chat about features.  You would then develop
the first version, and expect to iterate that version based on feedback. 
You will NOT be handed a detailed 20-page spec and asked to implement it
exactly.  I believe strongly in the importance of unit tests, and I would
expect you to develop a strong suite of tests with each application.

The company is located in Durham, NH, though I expect the successful
contractor to telecommute.  However, there will be (at least monthly)
face-to-face meetings which means that you would need to be located within
driving distance.

Required skills:
Perl (please don't bother to apply unless you have several years full-time
experience with Perl)
Attention to detail

Desired skills:
Confidence with HTML::Mason, Class::DBI, HTML::Template, CGI::Application,
Test::More and AJAX
Familiarity with CVS and/or SVN
Experience coding to Mechanical Turk's API
Experience with PHP / Drupal
