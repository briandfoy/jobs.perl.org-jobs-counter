Job title: Software Engineer for Agile Startup

Company name: AboutUs

Internal ID: aboutus

Location: United States, Oregon, Portland

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
About Us
--------

We're one of the top 10 Rails sites on the internet with an Alexa traffic
rank around 1500. We've developed technologies that serve thousands of
requests per minute backed by scrapers that download and parse millions of
sites per hour.

Our team consists of a half dozen developers with specialties ranging from
the art of user experience to the science of modern datacenter
administration. We work in an open office with awesome views, following a
refined agile process drawing on Kanban, Extreme Programming, and Scrum.
Ward Cunningham (Wiki inventor and Agile pioneer) is a collaborator,
advisor, and pair-programming partner. Our desks have wheels. We have
meetings around a ping pong table. We pair, test, iterate, and all that
jazz.

About You
---------

We're looking for someone to impress us. We want developers who can jump in
and start creating value immediately. A strong drive to get things done is
important. Resilience in the face of hard problems is a must. In addition
it won't hurt to have experience with some or all of these:

* Ruby/Rails
* Programming in Perl or other languages
* Working with high traffic or big data
* Linux and Systems Administration
* UX and Front-End Development
* Agile and TDD
