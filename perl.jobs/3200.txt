Job title: Your Chance to Learn Perl "On the Job"

Company name: Ticketmaster

Internal ID: TMO-PJ

Location: United States, CA, West Hollywood

Pay rate: Commensurate with Skills

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Regular Hire

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
As many of you know, Ticketmaster is a big perl/mod_perl company. In fact,
some of you may have read our job postings over the years. I want to point
out that there are some important changes in our "ideal" candidate for our
current openings. Ticketmaster has historically interviewed people based
very much on their perl expertise and that makes sense given our rapid
growth and our focus on perl. However, I have a number of new open
positions for our core engineering team where proficiency in perl is
**NOT** a requirement.

    Why bring this to the attention of a perl jobs list?

To be totally honest, if you get a job here, you'll be coding in perl. It's
what we do. In order for this to work, we do expect you to have a
background in software development and object-oriented coding skills. We'd
also expect that you would feel very comfortable in a linux/unix
development world. The last and perhaps most important requirement is
"spark!" We're searching out those people who have the unquenchable desire
to absorb and learn. If you have this skill, you know it. You're the one
who just naturally rises to the top. Come to Ticketmaster and we'll give
you the environment where you can become an uber-geek of perldom if that's
what you really want!

[If you're already a perl wizard, well then "yeah!" of course I'd always
like to talk with you too!]

Ticketmaster has excellent benefits (Medical/Dental/Vision, 401K, FSA,
etc.) and we foster a work hard/play hard attitude (in fact, I just got
back from a company sponsored night at the King Tut exhibit!).

We have new positions available for associate, mid, and senior-level
engineers. Please contact me directly if you have any questions. Appended
below is our "CANNED" or generic mid-level job description. Call for more
details.

NOTE: I will _not_ entertain calls or emails from recruiting agencies… it's
the best way to get on my blacklist ;)
