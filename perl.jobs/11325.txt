Job title: OO Perl developer with web focus

Company name: CTI

Internal ID: Tommy

Location: United States, TX, Plano

Pay rate: 60K-75K USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Privately held company seeks a software engineer to round out a 4 man
development team.  Although this is a web focused position - we do not make
"websites".  Our product is specialized communication (phone/video) systems
that go into jails and prisons. It just happens to have a web interface
that controls everything.

Small company with good benefit package (BlueCross/BlueShield medical and
employer pays 80% of your premium).  Working remotely is possible for right
candidate, but we have never done it in a full time position before.

Also, we have two public facing websites that are due for a revamp (the
90's are over).  You would get to help design and implement a database
driven site for our public customers, and a portal for our direct clients.


Required skills:
- Moose (Object Oriented Perl)
- Catalyst Web Framework
- DBIX
- mySQL
- AJAX familiarity
- "linux" (we deploy primarily on debian)
- svn, or familiarity with any version control system


Desired skills:
- jquery (javascript, we have a graphics designer but why wait on him when
you can do what you need)
- linux admin skills (it's 1:00am, do you know where you boxen are?)
- memcached
- vSphere 4 (we run some things in vmware)
- SIP/H.323
- video and audio compression and codec familiarity
- Asterisk (not in your responsibility, but we use it)
- git (working towards a switch from svn)
- high tolerance for puns
- Android development
