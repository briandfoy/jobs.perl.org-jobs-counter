Description:
We represent Atmail, a Webmail client/server that is written in Perl. Our
company is seeking a Perl/Flash developer to add Video-email functionality
to our Webmail client.

The requirements are using the latest Flash-8 Webcam functionality, to
allow users to compose a new email message, and optionally click a button
to attach a Video-mail message.

Flash would be used to capture the Video/audio from the users browser, and
send this data to the Atmail software running Perl.

On the server side this data has to be captured and sent on the outgoing
message as a MIME attachment.

On the Webmail frontend of Atmail, the user-interface has to be tweaked to
recognize MIME encoded messages that contain the Video-mail, and display
the result to the user in an intuitive manner.


Required skills:
Flash, Perl, mysql, mod-perl, MIME understanding

Desired skills:
Experience using Flash to capture the Webcam, SMTP
