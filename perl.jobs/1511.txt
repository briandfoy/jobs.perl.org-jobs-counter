Job title: Perl / Sendmail expertise required

Company name: Citigroup

Internal ID: 77353

Location: United States, New Jersey, Rutherford

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Citigroup are looking for someone with strong Perl skills to join the
e-mail backbone engineering group, which I'm a member of
(Nik.Clayton@citigroup.com).

Basically, we're a Sendmail (open source, rather than commercial version)
shop, with a lot of Perl thrown in to the mix to do the heavy lifting. 
Perl for system automation, reporting, mail scanning, and so forth.

For this particular role, experience with Sendmail in large environments is
going to be less important, and experience with software development and
problem solving, typically in Perl, is more important.	We make use of open
source technologies where possible (CVS / Subversion, Perl
itself, Sendmail, MIMEDefang, wikis, and so on), and we're not a
not-invented-here shop -- if there's something on CPAN that'll solve a
problem, we're all for it.

We've got a lot of projects that need to be either maintained, or
kick-started, so you'll need to be a self-starter.  And your code needs to
be readable, and follow appropriate best-practices.  That means POD,
comments, liberal use of Test::{More,Simple} or similar, and so on.

You'll need to know C, and be comfortable doing "cvs diff" between (for
example) 2 different versions of Sendmail to see what's changed.  Any
experience with XS would also be handy, although not mandatory (we picked
it up in about 3 weeks, you probably should be able to too).

The Backbone group is geographically distributed, with members in
Rutherford, Dallas, and London, and servers all over the globe. There'll be
some third line support work involved, which may or may not (not sure yet)
necessitate carrying a pager and our Blackberry -- some of us in the group
have them, some don't.

This role's in Rutherford, NJ.	That's non-negotiable I'm afraid, although
there may be the opportunity to do at least some working from home.  There
may also be occasional visits in to Citigroup's offices in Manhattan.  If
you're physically located in Manhattan at the moment,
Citigroup runs a regular (free) shuttle bus service between the offices,
which may make the commute easier.

If you're interested, follow the URL and start the application process. 
Please don't send CVs directly to me, as that'll probably piss off HR, and
there are probably all sorts of rules and regulations that prohibit me from
doing anything with them anyway.
