We strive towards code reuse and sane coding standards, with peer code

environment. Flexible and remote working is fine by us.

Required skills:
•	2-3 yrs Perl programming experience 
	•	2-3 yrs experience with Unix-based systems (systems
administration or Perl development). 
	•	Excellent knowledge of common Internet protocols (e.g.
HTTP, SMTP, DNS, Whois) 
	•	Excellent Perl programming skills, including Object
Orientated development, debugging, test-driven development, POD
documentation and common CPAN modules 
	•	Good Unix skills, including shell scripting & database
administration 
	•	A love of things Perl

Desired skills:
•	Experience in the domain registration / web hosting market
	•	Any of Moose, DBIx::Class or Perl Dancer experience
	•	An encyclopedic knowledge of PHP developer jokes and/or an
impressive beard
