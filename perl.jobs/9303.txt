Job title: Automation Developer for Voice in MMOG's

Company name: Vivox, Inc

Location: United States, MA, Natick

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Vivox is changing the world with internet voice in MMOG's, casual games and
stand-alone voice apps. We're middleware working in an agile framework so
we test by building our own applications with an occasional afternoon
playing an online game with the rest of the company to try out a new plugin
we've built for another game market segment.

We're looking for top-notch programmers to add to our team, starting off
with people with the talent and creativity to knock the heck out of our
applications before we release them to the wild.

Vivox is up and coming, and so should you be. We encourage and invest in
the excellence of our staff.


Required skills:
* strong experience in OOPerl
* solid discipline and understanding of test-as-you-go agile principles
* deep understanding of breaking down features/ideas into tasks and success
criteria (how do I know I'm done?)
* excellent writing/communication in a technical environment


Desired skills:
* C++, Perl's Test:: modules
* platform scripting (Win, Mac, Linux)
* SWIG (opensource)
* SQL (postgres and mysql, preferred)


* perl: TCP/IP, power management (Net-Wake)
* network layer of computing and process management
* in-process vs. out-of-process integrations
* running remote clients
