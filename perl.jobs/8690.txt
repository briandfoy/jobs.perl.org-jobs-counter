Job title: Software Engineer, FM&T

Company name: BBC

Internal ID: 400418

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
It takes a lot of work behind the scenes to keep the BBC running this
smoothly. Everyone needs to be looking to the future – and our BBC Vision
Multiplatform Directorate is no exception. We’re aiming to be at the
forefront of internet and interactive TV developments – so you’ll get to
work with some of the newest software out there.

You’ll have the chance to develop, manage and document quality components
for interactive websites, and contribute to our software development
infrastructure. On top of this, it will be up to you to translate and
communicate technical information across the department and help with
long-term planning.

Required skills:
Our primary programming language is Perl, so you’ll need to be confident
using this. Clearly, you’ll also need excellent software engineering
skills, a working knowledge of unix systems, SQL and relational databases,
and CGI programming. The ability to use HTML and Javascript effectively
will also be essential.
