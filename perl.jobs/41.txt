Subject: Seeking Perl Job -Telecommute 100%
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: amybrownlee@triad.rr.com ("Amy Brownlee")

Hello,

	My name is Amy Brownlee and I am seeking work as a Web Developer utilizing
Perl, MySQL, and HTML.  I live in Graham, North Carolina and I want to
telecommute 100%.  I have written a Perl script, login.pl, which take user
ID, pin and password info, from a HTML form and then validates that the user
is in a MYSQL table.  Valid members will be sent to register.html to
complete the registration process. Members that are not in the table are
taken to a sorry.html page. Register.pl is another Perl script that I have
written.  It takes registration info from an HTML form, creates a record in
a MySQL table, and sends an email to an administrator.  Ordertrack.pl is
another Perl script that I have written that retrieves a customer's order
shipping info when they enter their order number into the tracking number
field on an HTML page.  It then searches a MYSQL table and generates an HTML
page display their shipping info with a link to the UPS website. If the
order number is not in the table then an invalid order number HTML page is
generated.
My pay rate is $40-$60 per hour. I can be reached by email at
amybrownlee@triad.rr.com or after 6pm at 336-570-0242.
My resume is available at:

Thanks,

Amy Brownlee
