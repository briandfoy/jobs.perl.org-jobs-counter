Job title:
OO/mod_perl wizard, code generation software

Company name: Phase N Australia Pty Ltd

Location: Australia, NSW, Sydney

Pay rate: Neg

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We produce a large (50k+ SLOC), artificially intelligent, automated perl
web software code generation product. The system is sophisticated enough
that it now writes and maintains it's own codebase on a daily basis.

If a candidate of sufficient quality can be found, an offer will be made to
join the company as a core programmer. Your work would involve modification
and improvement of the system itself, the code it creates, and significant
project post-generation customisations. You will be working largely
alongside the author of the system.

A portion of your time will be allocated to experiment with new
developments as you see fit.

We expect this to be a long search, and the odds are you are probably
working for another company already. This is an international search,
applicants from overseas will be accepted. In this case, you should be
willing to move to Australia, and have confirmed your ability to get a
working Visa before applying. Companies in Australia often are able to do
little to assist with obtaining a Visa, so you should probably be able to
get one independantly.

This is an open long term search. We will be leaving this job posted until
such time as the position is is filled. If this post is visible, it is NOT
stale. Please contact if interested.

Pay and conditions are linked to ability. For this position, we are using
80k - 100k as a rough operating range, but the details of the package would
be negotiated, including stock or other benefits.

Be aware that due to the highly sensitive nature of the position, you are
likely to be expected to undergo a background check.

Required skills:
You are a perl master, you consider yourself to be a world class perl
programmer, no project too difficult.
You are probably known to the Perl community, you almost certainly have a
CPAN account.
You have designed, built, and maintained large scale object orientated perl
codebases ( 50+ classes, 10k+ SLOC )

You are _highly_ experienced in all or most of
- mod_perl
- regular expressions
- Template Toolkit
- DBI, Class::DBI et al
- MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQLite
- multiple inheritance ( widget systems etc )
- Testing ( Test::More and friends )
- Documentation ( POD, autodocumentation )
- CVS ( branching schemes etc )
- The intricacies of Date and Time


Desired skills:
- JavaScript
- XML
- Other databases
- C/XS coding
- Code Generation
- Artificial Intelligence

The ability to read is required. As an initial test of intelligence and to
protect against resume spamming, anyone sending their resume/CV will be
ignored. We expect to be able to find information about you without needing
your resume.

Contacts from agents may be accepted if you have someone in mind already.
