Description:
Our immediate need is for one short-term programmer for a fast turnaround

typically add several new clients each year. The work is always new and
interesting.

Required skills:
Strong Perl and CGI skills are needed. Familiarity with DBI is also
required. Must be able to work with complex Perl data structures, including
multi-level references and objects. Must be very comfortable working in
Unix/Linux environment. Fast turnaround is needed, so you need to be
available at least 20-30 hours per week -- more is better. Ability to pick
up complex projects quickly is required.
