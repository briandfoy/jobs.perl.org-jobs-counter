Location: Washington, DC

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Join a sharp team of people doing challenging work supporting world class
science and technology. As part of the Center for Computational Science,
you will be building web-based applications for the Naval Research

The ideal candidate has experience building web applications in Perl and

a four-year computer science degree, or an engineering degree in a

excellent analytical and problem-solving skills.

We are committed to the LAMP stack in particular and open source in
general. We value learning, new ideas, and creative solutions -- you'll be
joining a team that designs and implements a variety of web-based

realistic and developers have a wide latitude to explore technologies and
techniques.
