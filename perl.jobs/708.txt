Job title:
Perl/Web Developer for (short term) Web Password Managment Project.

Description:
We require an experienced Perl/Apache developer to help implement a
password managment application on a public web site.

The project involves three components: 1) XHTML form creation, and CGI/Perl
Processing of the form; 2) XHTML/CGI/Perl application on the server to
allow customer services to interact with the web server and configure it's
authentication DB; and 3) An additional process would also be required to
synchronise production DB data with the web site.

The Perl developer would be working closly with one DB/middleware
developer, one Linux/Unix admin and one web developer (XML/Perl/Apache).

We believe that the time required on site would be about 2 weeks work,
though we may extend this if nessesary. We expect the planning stage to
take an additional two weeks, during which time some input may be required,
but attendance during all this time is not expected.

We hope to start the project as soon as a suitable candidate is found. Time
frame for delivery is end January 2003/start February 2003.

* HTML - knows basics of GUI design in HTML.
* HTTP - understands how to use LWP or sililar in Perl
* Apache - Must be familar with Apache, and Apache password control systems

Desired skills:
* XML - Data will travel via XML
* SSH - Some secure syncronisation involved
* XSLT - know how to transform simple XML to simple XHTML
* cron - able to schedule jobs
* DB - MySQL or DB_File to manage passwords
* JavaScript - useful but not essential for DHTML
