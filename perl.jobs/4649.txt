Job title:
Perl Systems Developer for real-time news company

Company name: Wall Street Source

Location: United States, NY, New York City

Pay rate: 60-90k DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permenant

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Wall Street Source is searching for Developers with a background in
database-driven applications who will play an important role in the
continued expansion of our real-time information services.

We're looking for well-rounded developers with anywhere from 2-10 years
(Junior - Senior level) of Perl development experience.  Good candidates
will have experience developing well-tested, well-structured OO-perl
applications.  If your development workstation runs Linux, that's a plus. 
If you've ever contributed to anything on CPAN, that's also a plus.


Required skills:
* Perl.  Experience using Perl as a real development language, and not just
for 250-line shell scripts or CGIs.
* A BS in computer science or relevant programming experience.
* Linux, MySQL, experience developing applications and running systems in a
networked environment (e.g. can you explain to me what a DNS server does,
and how to make local changes to ignore what a DNS server tells you?).
* Experience working on sites serving 1M+ pages/day or otherwise dealing
with larger datasets/loads.
* Strong written and interpersonal skills.


Desired skills:
* Experience with the principals of search engine technology, or experience
with commercial search engines (e.g. Verity, Endeca, FAST).
* Experience with messaging systems (Tibco, TAO/ACE, ActiveMQ or others)
* Experience with commercial news feeds (DowJones, Reuters, etc).
