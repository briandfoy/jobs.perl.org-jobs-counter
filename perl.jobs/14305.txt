Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Broadbean Technology Ltd

Location: Canary Wharf, London, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're currently looking for a talented Senior Perl Developer to join our
team in Canary Wharf.

Broadbean is a leading provider of sourcing solutions for recruiters. We
have over 60,000 users who post in excess of 2 million adverts a month via
our award winning software. We also track approximately 9 million job
applications across 65 countries a month. But we want to do more.

We're a small company (90 people in the UK), owned by a very big company
(CareerBuilder), and a great place to work. Post-probation we offer
(non-contractually) flexible working and 50% telecommuting. We've got a
development team of 30 and are fully committed to Perl, clearing our
technical debt, and doing things the right way moving forward.

You will be maintaining the existing product offerings, working on entirely
new code and a combination of the two. The existing code will require you
to be flexible in your approach while the new code will demand to be well
considered and scalable.

We work in project teams that own their respective scrums to deliver
functional continuous delivery. You may be on a team for months delivering
several products or involved in short sprints to push out critical code
updates.

Required skills:
You'll need to show proof of strong and "Modern" Perl - at least
familiarity with various testing modules, exposure to Moose would be
useful. You should have opinions that you can justify on the "right" level
of testing, and the pros and cons of continuous delivery. You can take a
stab at the philosophical differences between Catalyst, Dancer, and
Mojolicious.

The in-person interview will test your perl skills (OO, refs, scope, etc)
and as we're looking for Senior devs, the expectations will be high. We are
interested in how you solve problems and your thought process so when you
get stuck, tell us what you're thinking.

Aside from excellent Perl skills we're looking for a candidate who can
demonstrate the ability to manage the presentation of data on the frontend
- an eye for design and a talent for several Javascript libraries.

This is a company full of new ideas that we bring to life.  If you think
this is a world you want to be a part then letâ€™s talk.	This is your
opportunity to make a difference and be part of an agile, creative and
innovative company.

Desired skills:
* Strong desire to understand business requirements and how to turn these
into code while maintaining the best approach.
* Solid frontend skills (Javascript: EmberJS, JQuery, etc) to go along with
excellent Perl.
* Strong belief in a particular toolset (framework, module, etc) while
being open to debate this opinion with others.
* Solid mentoring skills and the ability to spot both a coder in trouble
and a rising star.
* Experience with designing and implementing projects from the initial
"architecture on a post-it" stage through to the on-going maintenance
phase.
* A Bitbucket, Github, CPAN or equivalent account so we can see examples of
your code
