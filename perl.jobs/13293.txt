Pay rate: £50-70k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Thermeon are looking for experienced programmers to join its UK development
team. Applicants should be versatile and inquisitive by nature, able to
adapt to new technologies, frameworks and languages. A personal interest in
computing and programming should drive applicants to explore and innovate
on their own. Thermeon provides services and software primarily to the car
rental industry, and employees find interesting challenges that stimulate
innovative solutions using the full range of technical resources available.


Telecommuting is available, if candidates have a track record of
successfully working remotely in the past,
have a suitable environment free from distractions, and are available to
travel to the
Gatwick based UK office when necessary.

Applicants should be fluent in the Linux environment with experience in
web services, web servers, databases and networking.
They must have strong history of planning and delivering projects from
beginning to end.

An engaged approach to problem solving and a self-reliance are key
attributes for a candidate. Thermeon will continue to investigate and
adopt new technologies and employees should always enjoy learning to
apply new dynamic solutions to existing problems.

Required skills:
Whilst a capacity to learn is fundamental to the role, the following
skills/familiarities are required:

- Perl 4+ years (Catalyst/DBIxC/Moose/POE)
- Unit testing
- Version Control (git/hg)
- Web interfaces (XML/SOAP/HTML/CSS)
- Javascript frameworks (ExtJS ideally)
- Relational Databases (Postgresql)
- Linux environment (Bash/zsh/vim)
- Web Servers (apache/lighttpd)
