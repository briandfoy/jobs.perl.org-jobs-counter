Job title: perl, Mason, DBI, AWS programmer

Company name: Foneshow, Inc.

Location: United States, ME, Portland

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
We are looking for 2-3 experienced Perl programmers to help us enhance and
maintain our mobile content service, which integrates a Mason-driven Web
site, an Asterisk-based interactive-telephony application, and a
message-queue-driven content-processing engine running in Amazon's EC2
server cloud. 

This can be a telecommuting contract, or you could use this as a chance to
move to stunning, affordable Portland, Maine - it's the Portland, Oregon of
the Northeast! We're a VC-backed, Silicon Valley-type startup with an airy
loft in the funky, busy Old Port area. Skiing, kayaking, hiking and
camping, sailing, hunting and fishing are just a short ride away.

Desired skills:
object-oriented Perl, Amazon Web Services, Asterisk AGI, git, AJAX
