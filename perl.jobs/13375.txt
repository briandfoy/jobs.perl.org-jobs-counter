The candidate will have commercial Perl software development experience
including database development (PostgreSQL, MySQL or other SQL). C/C++
Programmers should also apply, but these are Perl Developer positions.

candidate will have, at least, an understanding of Agile as a philosophy,
Agile frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, XP) and as a practice (e.g. TDD, CI etc.).
Agile team experience would be a significant benefit but not essential. The
candidates should also have commercial experience of source control systems
and concepts.PERL (CPAN, OO Perl)

Desired skills:
Javascript (JQuery, JSON, AJAX)
Catalyst or other MVC framework
