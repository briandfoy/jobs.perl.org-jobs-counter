Job title:
Senior Perl Developer? Learn machine learning and natural language
processing

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: Amsterdam

Pay rate: Excellent + bonus

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Join a team of 10 machine learning and natural language geeks working on a
modern and well-tested Perl codebase in Amsterdam (near Nieuwendam). You're
an experienced Perl developer, perhaps with some exposure to Perl internals
(and XS), but also with the ability to guide a team of scientists in Perl
best practices.

The team takes software engineering practices seriously:
code reviews, collaborative design, continuous integration and deployment.
Their test suite is built on top of Test::More, and an inhouse framework
that runs many regression tests.

The team is part of a well-established,
profitable, and long-running Netherlands company with a wide and solid
customer base who love their products. The company is fast-growing and very
international - over 24 nationalities and counting. You'll be offered great
equipment, free lunches, snacks and drinks, and the office has easy access
to public transport and free parking. On a personal note, having
collaborated closely with the company as part of a former role, I'm yet to
see another company that empowers and involves their employees quite so
much in product development and strategy - they're good people who respect
their team!

Salary is market-level for Amsterdam, with an almost 1 month
holiday salary and a 1 month bonus based on performance. Relocation
assistance is offered to those with an existing right to work in the EU,
and those relocating may find themselves able to take advantage of the 30%
Dutch tax expat exemption.

Desired skills:
Familiarity with Modern Perl, especially exposure to Mojolicious would be
advantageous. Familiar with Perl and software engineering best practices
