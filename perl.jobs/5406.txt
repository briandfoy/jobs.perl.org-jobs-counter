Location: United States, NY, New York City

Pay rate: Open, $$

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Systems Administrator position

Hi,

I am seeking SysAdmins for a great company in NYC. They have asked my help
in identifying exceptional systems administrators with at least five years
industry experience. They are eager to see top SysAdmins from any industry
including, but not limited to, banking (e.g. top tier investment banks and
hedge funds), telecommunications (e.g. Bell Labs) and technology (e.g. IBM,
Intel, Google). They remain interested in strong candidates supporting
research groups (e.g. universities and national labs) provided they are
doing hands-on systems work. 

The company is a specialized investment and technology development firm
whose activities center on various aspects of the intersection between
technology and finance. Since its organization, the firm has earned an
international reputation for financial innovation and technological
leadership. In addition to using advanced mathematical and computational
techniques to trade in various domestic and international securities
markets, the company also devotes substantial resources to the
conceptualization, early-stage development, and financing of internally
developed start-up ventures within industries it believes are likely to be
fundamentally transformed by the use of technology. 

Required skills:
A history of solving challenging systems problems is more important than
expertise in any particular area.  This is not a management position,
though we welcome any technical managers interested in returning to
hands-on technical work. 

Desired skills:
Ideal candidates will have a mastery of systems fundamentals, UNIX or
Linux, and strong programming or scripting ability in C, C++ and Python or
Perl.

Clustering and/or scientific computing experience is desired but not
required.
