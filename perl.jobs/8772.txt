Job title:
Short-term, immediate opportunity for Perl/Movable Type Programmer

Company name: large interactive agency

Location: United States, New York, New York

Pay rate: $50-90/hour

Travel: 0%

Length of employment: 40 hours +

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a developer to finalize programming/customization of a
blog built on the Movable Type platform, which is based entirely on PERL.
MT is running in a Linux environment.

I am the content manager of pre-launch blog that has been partially built
in Movable Type. The blog serves as an internal resource for our agency, a
leading interactive house with 500+ employees. The staff programmer
assigned to skinning this blog was re-assigned to a client priority, and
development is 65% complete. ID and graphic elements are all in place,
platform is up and running, but many significant bugs remain (ei, tag and
calendar display, database access).

As the platform is hosted behind a firewall, we need someone who can work
onsite in our office in NYC.

We estimate project will require 35-40 hours to complete development, push
live, and final QA.  I would imagine that an MT expert could accomplish the
work somewhat quicker.

We are looking for someone to start immediately.

Required skills:
Perl, MySQL, CGI, Movable Type programming

Desired skills:
attention to detail, ability to jump into a new project quickly
