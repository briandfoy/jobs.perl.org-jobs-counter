Job title: Web Application support

Company name: Oakbox Productions

Location: Netherlands, Breda

Pay rate: 45 Euros per hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am an independent contractor based in the Netherlands.  I am reaching the
limit of how much time I can work, but have more work available.  

I am looking for someone who will be:
 - Online during the day (GMT +1) to field customer inquiries if something
blows up and I am not available.
 - Interested in picking up extra bits of work as they come in.

Basically, I want someone who is a freelancer like me who has some space in
their schedule to pick up some slack.  

Required skills:
Perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 OO experience
 GD

MySQL

Desired skills:
It would be VERY nice if you are fluent in Nederlands.	I don't trust my
grammar in Dutch and most of my sites have both an English and Dutch side. 
Extra points if you are a PerlMonk so I can see your public persona.  I am
'oakbox' on that web site.
