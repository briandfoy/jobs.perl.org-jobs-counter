Job title:
Why let Silicon Valley have all the Fun? Perl Developer job in Cyberjaya /
Kuala Lumpur

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location:
Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Pay rate: Depending on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If only there were a place like Silicon Valley, but warmer . . .

Sure,
Silicon Valley is great. They=E2=80=99ve got some of the world=E2=80=99s la=
rgest tech
companies and some pretty nice offices, but do you know what else they
have? Mist. Fog. Chilly weather that seeps into your clothes and makes you
wish for warm, sunny days that don=E2=80=99t leave you shivering. If you wi=
sh you
could find a tech hub without the risk of hypothermia, then why not
consider the Silicon Valley of Malaysia, where the temperature is always
balmy? Pack your bags=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re on your way to Cyberjaya!

Located a short
drive from Kuala Lumpur, Cyberjaya is the best of Silicon Valley. This
science park is home to numerous large corporations, and is outfitted with
the sort of amenities that make programmers and developers starry-eyed. No
sad, dingy offices here: Cyberjaya has The Cyberjaya Lake Gardens (a
400-acre nature park), many bars and restaurants serving incredible fusion
cuisine, basketball and tennis courts, swimming pool, golf driving range,
and even a go-kart circuit! Does that sound like the average workplace to
you?

Our client is a financial company whose growth over the last twenty
years has been nothing short of impressive. They started with the idea that
online trading should be available to all, and from there, they=E2=80=99ve =
built a
company with multiple locations worldwide. If you want to be part of a
business that is thriving, this may be the perfect opportunity for you.

The Cyberjaya office is looking for Perl developers with a strong exposure
to Modern Perl =E2=80=93 you=E2=80=99ll be comfortable with Plack/PSGI, Moo=
se, and writing
tests.

Cyberjaya is a town unto itself=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99ve even got their own
post-secondary institution, the Multimedia University=E2=80=94and there=E2=
=80=99s plenty to
do there. However, you may not have time to see it all, because on weekends
you=E2=80=99ll certainly want to take advantage of the travel possibilities=
. Air
Asia=E2=80=99s home airport is only a short distance from Cyberjaya, so you=
=E2=80=99ll have
plenty of fun, exciting travel destinations at your doorstep. Why settle
for takeout Thai at home when you could fly to Bangkok for dinner out on
Friday night?

Ready to trade your 9-to-5 for an exciting new role in the
Silicon Valley of Malaysia? Then tune up your go-kart, grab the kids, and
start your application!

Desired skills:
Looking for Perl developers with a strong background in Modern Perl =E2=80=
=93 you
should be comfortable with Moose and PSGI/Plack, and a solid grounding in
using Perl=E2=80=99s testing tools.
