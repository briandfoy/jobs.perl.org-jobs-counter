Job title:
Assistant Perl developer for travel company

Company name: Skoosh

Internal ID: skoosh

Location: United Kingdom, Brighton

Pay rate: $20ph+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Skoosh has been established for 8 years and is a fast growing b2c site for
booking hotel accommodation. We compete head to head with the biggest
players in our industry. This is a particularly exciting time as our brand
is beginning to flourish.


Required skills:
We require 2 more developers for an ongoing project to extend our current
software. As our existing team is based in Russia our preference would be
for more Russian developers but that's not crucial.
We need reasonable English, Perl, MySQL and Javascript knowledge.
Training on our system can take 2-3  months so any freelancers should be
prepared to work for a year or longer.

Desired skills:
English, Perl, MySQL and Javascript knowledge.
