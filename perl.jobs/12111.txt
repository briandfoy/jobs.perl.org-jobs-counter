Now in its 15th year, this is one of the UK’s great unsung success stories.
The website serves up to 150m page views a month, and reaches a significant

difference and aren't afraid of a challenge, to join their dedicated team.
Their Perl development team builds the platform behind all aspects of the
business, including their website, data processing, analysis, reporting,
and CRM. The architecture is mainly based on Linux, Apache, Perl, MySQL,
Amazon's Web Services (EC2/S3), memcached and other technologies.

Required skills:
* Strong OO development skills (in e.g. PHP5, C++, Java, or ideally Perl)
* Linux (ideally Debian/Ubuntu), Apache2, MySQL
* Database / data-processing experience
* XHTML, CSS

Desired skills:
* Amazon's Web Services (EC2/S3)
* Large-scale data processing, distributed systems
* Good theoretical grounding, whether obtained via academia or work
experience
* Ajax, jQuery, visual design skills
