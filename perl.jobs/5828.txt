Job title: Senior LAMP Developer / Architect

Company name: SVG Inc (skinvideo.com)

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: $110,000+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
SVG Technology, Inc. is a small company seeking a lead software
engineer/architect to take over development of our subscription-based adult
video web site. You will work with our fabulously talented product manager,
marketer, and engineering support to improve our service and take it to new
levels of traffic and success. You will be the technical decision maker and
implementer for the site.

Our service has grown from a couple of home-built PC's serving up static
content to more than 150 servers that store and serve up over 20TB of
streaming video at a sustained 3Gb/s. You will grow it even further.

Note that we are serving up insane amounts very adult content, and this
should not bother you.

Required skills:
Our web site is almost completely based on top of the basic LAMP stack:
linux, apache, mysql, perl. You must be incredibly familiar with each part
of the stack, know to solve problems and scale each layer, and be eager to
tackle new problems.


Desired skills:
We use the following perl tech: mogile, memcached, perlbal, SPOP, catalyst,
mod_perl and log4perl. A perfect candidate has worked with each, a good
candidate could pick them up and use them with no trouble.

Some portions of our infrastructure are written in java, using spring,
spring-mvc, and hibernate. The perfect candiate could continue developing
those, a good candidate  could at least maintain them and fix simple bugs.
