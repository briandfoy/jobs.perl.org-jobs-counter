Our offices are in Hoxton Square (nearest tube is Old Street).	We have
half an hour of flexitime, so you can start at half nine if mornings aren't
your speciality.  We're offering a salary of 30-35k depending on
ability/experience.

antique dealers - we also run sites for various national associations, and
for individual dealers)
