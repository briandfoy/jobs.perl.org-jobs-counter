provide SQA for development. An ideal candidate will have distributed
system testing experience, strong analytical abilities, excellent teamwork
and communication skills, and the ability to design, implement, maintain
and extend effective system test automation solutions.


About the Team

The Server Platforms team develops and supports communications and the data
collection infrastructure for Akamai's distributed platform. This
infrastructure is comprised of a kernel, an operating system, and a series
of core components which serve as a baseline for the rest of the Akamai
networks. These systems distribute configuration data, control information,
and customer traffic to Akamai's distributed servers.  They also publish,
aggregate, and deliver internal system and customer data for use by
internal and customer-facing monitoring, alerting, and reporting
applications.  These systems are among the largest in the world, which
brings unique engineering challenges for developing distributed, scalable,
and fault-tolerant systems.

Responsibilities
* In-depth understanding of the SQA life-cycle from functional requirements
gathering to the design and execution of automated and manual system level
tests.

* Understand the developer's design spec and write unit tests against that
spec.

* Perform code reviews on developers' designs.
* Design testing tools which includes developing scripts to enhance
regression testing and feature testing.

* Perform and participate in all aspects of verification including
requirements gathering, feature and functional testing, unit testing,
regression, load and performance testing.

* Support and maintain the testnet infrastructure using either real
hardware or virtual machines.

* Develop creative and thorough analyses to identify root causes of
technical problems while developing resolutions.

* Design, develop, and deploy automated system tests to replicate
real-world scenarios.

* Qualify new hardware for both Akamaiâ€™s Linux systems and Windows systems

Required skills:
Basic Qualifications

* Education: Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or related technical
area.

* 2+ years work experience developing scripts and test automation with
Perl.

* Minimum 1 year of experience with C or C++.
* Minimum of 1 year experience developing test plans for both functional
and performance testing.
* Minimum of 1 year experience using the Unix/Linux kernel.

* Minimum of 1 year experience using a Windows based system.

* Minimum of 1 year experience with routing protocols such as HTTP, DNS,
TCP/IP, etc.

skills.

* Experience with proxy servers, web servers, and caching technologies is a
plus.

* Competence and self-motivation in analyzing problems and getting to the
root cause.

* Ability to review bug descriptions, functional requirements, design
documents and code.

* Ability working closely with developers to design test criteria and
develop test plans.

* Strong understanding of QA life cycle: requirements gathering, testing
definition, QA methodologies, and test execution.

* Knowledge of both the Linux and Windows kernel and their testing.

* Experience with commonly available testing packages.

* Experience with the use of virtual machines in testing.
