My client are a dynamic business which is leading the market in developing

They have an opening for a Senior Perl Developer. They’ve enjoyed rapid

challenging role but rewarding on many levels. Their technical team has
nearly 50 members- and this is set to increase further- who are
predominantly based in the UK but they have also team members in Australia
and the US.
You'll be responsible for helping customers integrate with their APIs, and
in some cases building and maintaining those integrations. The role is a
customer facing one, and you'll need to be comfortable with the idea of
going to see a client and sketching out solutions with their developers, as
well as able to build solid integrations with appropriate monitoring and
logging.
