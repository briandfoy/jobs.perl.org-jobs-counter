Job title: ETL Developer

Company name: Grant Street Group, Inc.

Location: Pittsburgh, PA

Pay rate: Market

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Grant Street Group is looking for data conversion / ETL developers with
strong programming and database skills. If the following describes you, we
want to hear from you!

You enjoy writing great code. At Grant Street, you
will write data conversion code to migrate clients to our TaxSys software.
You’ll use Perl and SQL on a Linux / MySQL platform and our proprietary
parallel-computing ETL framework. You’re a strong programmer who either
knows Perl or wants to learn it.

You love debugging data. 90% of data
conversion is about fixing problems with the last 10% of the data. You’ll
combine technical skills with domain knowledge to track down elusive errors
in the clients’ data.

You love working in a team. On each conversion
you’ll be paired with a data specialist who will give you specs, validate
the converted data, and gather feedback from clients. You’ll be part of an
agile team of 4-6 people, all dedicated to giving the client a trouble-free
go-live.
This position is open to telecommuters. There is minimal travel:
2-4 weeks per year for on-site meetings in Pittsburgh. If you live (or want
to) in Pittsburgh, you can work in our beautiful headquarters atop the
Heinz building.

Our extraordinary company culture is the foundation of our
unmatched customer service — just ask our clients! We reward teamwork,
professional excellence, and individual responsibility. Using the best
collaboration tools available, we offer a technology-rich work environment
that makes it possible for us to support on-site and telecommuting
positions tailored to the needs of our employees. If you are passionate
about your work, you have entrepreneurial spirit and you want to be on a
team of exceptional professionals, then maybe Grant Street is for you!

Desired skills:
Experience writing production-quality code (Perl experience preferred).

Thorough knowledge of relational databases and SQL (MySQL experience
preferred).

Experience with ETL tools is a plus.
