Job title: Geek

Company name: GüdTech

Location: San Diego, CA

Pay rate: $50,000 - $150,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
At GüdTech, we endeavor to think about the big picture. We think outside
the box. When we take on a task, we think about how it should be, not how
it’s been done before. We don’t care if you’re a double-PHD or a high
school dropout.  As a GüdTech Geek, we only care about how well you can
think.

Solving problems is the name of the game. As a lean and mean team, we’re
responsible for making the rubber hit the road with minimum bullshit and
pointy-headed management to get in our way. From conceptualisation, to
implementation, to deployment, we do things a little differently. If you
want some cushy job where you trundle along not really doing much of
consequence, then this is not the job for you; However, if you seek a
challenge, not only in terms of personal growth but also the ability to
effect change, read on!

Required skills:
* A Great communicator 
An ill-communicated idea is as good as none at all. The ability to clearly
express your ideas is a must.

* A Self starter
Taking initiative and seeing things through to completion is kind of our
thing.

* Passionate about software
We believe that passion for a quality product is the only way to achieve
positive, sustainable outcomes with software. You should too.

* A robust understanding of basic web technologies.

* Experience with Open Source platforms like Linux.

* The ability to educate yourself as needed to get the job done.

* The ability to strike a balance between pragmatism and idealism.

Desired skills:
Proficiency in:
* Perl
* JavaScript
* ExtJS
* SQL
