Job title: Perl Software Engineer

Company name: Ensenda, Inc.

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: Competetive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Ensenda is a rapidly growing technology company that provides the fastest
delivery possible. We’re an important logistics partner to some of the
largest companies in the world, and we’re looking for the right candidates
to join our tech team. As a Software Engineer at Ensenda, you’ll be working
on new feature development for our products, maintenance of our
application, and programming through our development cycle. In the process
you’ll work on a host of interesting problems: tiered architectures, load
balancing, framework development, code & DB optimization, etc. Most of our
systems are written in Perl/modperl/Apache, with an eye towards moving to
other technologies as appropriate, and you’ll also get exposure to, and
have the opportunity to solve problems related to, high availability
systems, database replication, and distributed processing. As a business we
are set to grow, and the Software Engineer will play a key part.

Required skills:
The successful candidate will have a combination of great analytical and
design skills, good software development skills and basic systems
administration experience on an open-source stack (Linux/Apache/Perl). You
will possess the following:

1. Experience developing web based enterprise applications. Preference will
be given to candidates with Perl.

2. An interest in technology (hardware, software, and theory). Knowledge of
core concepts of software engineering and programming: pointers and complex
data structures, regular expressions and objects, imperative and functional
programming. Experience with UNIX (Linux, BSD, etc.), relational database
experience (SQL, joins), Apache, and a familiarity with XML.

3. Dependability, excellent troubleshooting skills, and a hands-on
attitude. You are hard-working, motivated, and smart.

4. The ability to estimate effort for a project and subsequently deliver on
your estimate.

5. Versatility. Today we use Perl and a host of supporting technologies
(Sybase, XML, etc.). Tomorrow we may be using something else. We expect
that you will be open to developing in other technologies.
