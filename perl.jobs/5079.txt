Job title: Perl/CGI/DBI/Sybase developer(s) needed

Company name: Information Technology Consulting

Location: United States, PA, Pittsburgh

Pay rate: negotiable (USD)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 2-3 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I'm seeking one or more motivated developers with solid experience
developing Web sites with database integration -- the project involves
patient records for a research project that is scheduled to start within
the next few months. Experience with Sybase or other industrial databases
is mandatory, along with a good grounding in methods for session security,
authentication, etc.

The work can be done remotely, and would be on a 1099 basis.  I expect the
active development phase to run for 2-3 months, but it could be up to 6
months.

Required skills:
Perl (especially CGI.pm), DBI, security conscious design, SQL, Linux are
necessary.  

Desired skills:
The ability to design and lay out Web-based forms is very helpful. 
Javascript experience would be a big plus, as would any AJAX background.
