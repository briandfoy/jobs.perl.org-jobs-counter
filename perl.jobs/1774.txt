Company name: Lieberman Software Corporation

Internal ID: Search Technologies

Location: United States, CA, Beverly Hills

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Do you have a background in writing search engines and caching systems?
Have you had personal experience writing web crawlers? Do you have a
passion for figuring out how to logically connect disparate pieces of
information? If so, we would like to talk to you! 

We are looking for a hardcore software developer to join our team. You must
have experience creating commercial applications and writing real code. You
should be the type of programmer who does not get intimidated when a
published API does not work as documented, and knows how to get the code to
work.

Experience writing search engines or web crawlers is highly preferred.
Knowledge of coding applications using network tunneling protocols, NAT,
proxies, firewalls, and Windows workstation security would also be
extremely helpful. Experience writing database applications and web
front-ends would be a definite plus. 

For this position, you should be knowledgeable about Perl (of course), COM
interfaces, basic CS concepts (order of complexity for algorithms,
stack/heap, recursion, polymorphism, generics, etc.), file access,
networking, etc. 


Required skills:
Perl - of course!
SQL and database operation
HTML, familiarity with proxies and web networking, etc.
Excellent english written and verbal skills!

Desired skills:
Strong experience with C++ is highly desirable.
