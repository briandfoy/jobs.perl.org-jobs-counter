Job title:
mod_perl/mysql programmer for job/community website

Company name: iAgora

Internal ID: perl programmer

Location: Spain, Barcelona

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are seeking a freelance programmer to participate in the maintainance
and
further development of the codebase that powers the 'www.iagora.com'
website.
This will be an on-going, medium- to long-term project.

iAgora's services are all developed in-house, and include: a job listing
system with advanced profile matching capabilities, a premium-level
membership
option, a management and distribution system for job offers, an interactive

user-contributed database of study-abroad experiences, a comprehensive
travel
section, as well as community features such as user profiles, forums and
clubs.

The entire system is written in the LAMP (Linux-Apache-Mysql-Perl)
platform,
using an open-source templating system running on Apache/mod_perl.
(http://www.iagora.com/about/software/iact/index.html)

The job will start under the direction of the current programmer, and
gain increasing independence, as familiarity with the system builds.

We are based in Barcelona (Spain).  We are open to candidates anywhere
in the world, but all things being equal we will give priority to
someone in or near Barcelona.


Required skills:
- Strong experience with perl and mysql web application development.
- Ability to learn and manage a large, pre-existing codebase.
- Familiarity with Linux system administration.


Desired skills: - Fluent English
