Job title:
Perl/MySQL programmer needed for Paypal IPN

Company name: AEL Solutions

Location: Canada, Qc, Montreal

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
This is a last-minute request. Please do not apply if you do not have a few
hours to spare in the next day!

I require someone to modify a Perl script to write data to a MySQL
database. Currently, the script writes values to a log-file. I simply need
that data also written to specified fields in a database.

The script itself handles IPN requests from Paypal (Instant Payment
Notification). There are 5 or 6 scenarios in which it needs to write data
to the logs/DB.

Please contact me ASAP with your email. I will forward you the script so
that you can take a quick look and give me a time and cost quote. Thanks in
advance to all who apply.

Adam Lazaris

Required skills: Perl, MySQL
