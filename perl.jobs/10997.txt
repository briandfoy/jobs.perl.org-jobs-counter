Job title: Perl Web Software Engineer

Company name: Rubenstein Technology Group

Internal ID: 201102

Location: United States, NY, Brooklyn

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Rubenstein Technology Group seeks a Perl Software Engineer with Web
Application and Content Management System (CMS) experience to join our
talented team of front- and back-end engineers in building next generation
Web applications for Web and mobile content management and e-commerce.

The ideal candidate will have 3 - 5 years of experience working with Perl
and/or PHP, and experience working with web applications and CMS systems.
Our 10-person team includes both front-end
(XHTML/HTML5/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery) and back-end software engineers, and
we're open to developers with interest in either end of development.
Ability to communicate effectively in a small team, and a true passion for
technology are musts. A degree in Computer Science or Engineering is
preferred.

This is a full-time temp-to-perm position, beginning with an initial
2-month contract. Employment includes full benefits and many of the perks
and privileges of working with a small, profitable tech firm
(health/dental/vision/gym/coffee/snacks/weekly lunches/top notch
hardware/retirement with match). We have been in business for over a
decade, have a solid track record of delivering professional software
solutions, and aren't dependent on our "next round of funding" to ensure
you get paid next week.

Rubenstein Technology Group is a team of software engineers that partners
with leading graphic designs to implement their creative on the Web and for
mobile (iPhone/iPad/Android) devices. We do so most often via our Ruby
Business Platform software, a sophisticated suite of web applications built
in Perl/Mason that we integrate and customize for each client. We also
provide mobile (iPhone/iPad/Android) development, most often powered by our
web-based CMS. Our design partners include some of the most recognized
designers in the industry, and our clients range from small business to
leading museums, cultural institutions, non-profits, and corporations.
