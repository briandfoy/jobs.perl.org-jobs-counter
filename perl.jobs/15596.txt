Job title: Web Application Developer (Java/LAMP)

Company name: PRA Health Sciences

Location: San Ramon, Ca

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is one of those opportunities that has it all, the ability to build
and create, help others grow in their careers, lead and work with a team of
extraordinary people. Every single position within PRA is more than the
scope of work and the sum of its parts. We are making a difference and
changing lives by bringing much needed and life-saving drugs into the hands
of the patients that need them. 

We welcome applicants with relevant
technical qualifications and have applied these skills in a team-based
environment. An excellent attention to detail and ability to solve problems
while maintaining a positive and confident outlook is important.

Together
with a competitive salary, we offer a comprehensive range of benefits and
an excellent working environment. As we continue to expand, there will be
career opportunities on a truly global scale. 


Culture is quintessential.
This is why ours cannot be beat:

We know that's what helps change people's
lives for the better every single day. We know that in order for clinical
development to reach its full potential, our industry needs people who
truly care about each and every outcome, and we know that's the reason
people come to work with us. Our employees care about what we do and they
care that it's done better than it has been done before. We know people
count on us, because that is who we are. We are PRA.

People don't come to
PRA to witness the future of clinical development. They come to shape it.
We find exceptional people and empower and encourage them. Or maybe,
because we empower and encourage them, exceptional people find us.
Whichever way it happens, the combination is truly awesome and the results
speak for themselves.

Desired skills:
The Day to Day Overview:

We are seeking a highly-skilled, enthusiastic,

family of companies. Nextrials has created an award-winning web
application, Prism, which is used for managing clinical research data. You
will have the opportunity to shape the next generation of Prism, using
whatever technology stack is most appropriate. Prism is currently written
