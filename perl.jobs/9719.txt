Job title: Software Reliability Engineer

Company name: kgbweb

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: commensurate w/exp

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Here at the web team of kgb we are an organizational centaur. The head of a
start-up with the body of a leading global information services company.
kgb has operated information businesses worldwide since 1992 and recently
launched the “Ask Us Anything” 542-542 Text message service. Therefore, we
pay a competitive salary with full benefits, and enjoy the strength and
resources of an established organization. In ancient times they called that
a “magical combination”. Today, they’d probably just coin it “reorganized
organizational organization.” 

We are a distinct small and agile team that functions as an incubated
start-up funded by a larger organization. Our mission is simple: completely
redefine the way users get their content on the web. 

Our office is extremely open and collegiate and we are committed to letting
ideas thrive above all else. Our office in midtown Manhattan is filled with
smiles, Ping Pong tables, brilliant ideas, movies, pizza, and laughter. We
find that pizza and ideas are highly correlated. 

We’re a very eclectic bunch of characters, but we all share a common
commitment to taking whatever we do, fun or work, to the max. Some words
that have been used to describe us are: passionate, fun, funny, innovative,
contrarian, automagical, brilliant, academic, whimsical, and most
importantly respectful. If you fit 3 or more of those descriptions, you
might just have some of that magic we’re looking for. 

Required skills:
As the Software Reliability Engineer at kgb web you will be a foundational
member of our Software Services team, working intimately with the CTO and
other developers. The Software Services team is responsible for reliably
moving, storing, indexing, and making easily accessible a variety of data
to be used in a major consumer facing product. The role of the Software
Reliability Engineer is to help manage the deployment of a variety of open
source projects and systems to accomplish these goals.
 
With so much to get done, every member of the team is encouraged to
participate in all areas of the group.	We expect this to excite our
candidates and find that the right candidates often make great
contributions outside of their area of focus. 
 
Responsibilities:
* Install, configure, operate, and monitor services for storing and
indexing data.
* Develop clustering and redundancy/failover methods to ensure reliability
of services.
* Identify and evaluate new services/projects to assist the Data team in
exploring possible new requirements.
 
Experience Guidelines (most of this should apply to you):
* Strong Linux/unix systems and operations background
* Experience with multi-system configurations for failover and clustering
* Comfort handling large amounts of data with scripting languages
* Monitoring of many systems and processes and ability to quickly debug
issues
 
We would be very happy if you:
* Know Perl, Python, Ruby
* Have experience with Amazon Web Services and cloud computing
* Have experience with Memcache, Lucene/Solr, Hadoop, or other distributed
systems that handle massive amounts of data
* Work comfortably in a fast paced start-up environment 
* Work comfortably on multiple projects simultaneously
