Company name: bepress

Internal ID: SE2010

Location: United States, CA, Berkeley

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Berkeley Electronic Press (www.bepress.com) provides cutting-edge,
Web-based solutions for the academic and scholarly community. We have a
number of products and services, including 42 (and counting) high-quality
peer-reviewed journals, as well as the world's leading hosted institutional
repository service -- "Digital Commons".

We are a successful Berkeley-based company with 50+ employees.	We have a
collaborative environment where technical and non-technical colleagues work
together to create great software, serve our customers and steer the future
of academic publishing and scholarly communications.

We are currently looking for an experienced applications developer with
significant Perl experience that can help bring our products to the next
level.	You'll be involved in making architectural decisions, putting new
systems and protocols in place, implementing new and exciting dynamic
in-page workflow using JavaScript and Perl as well as owning significant
pieces of the existing platform.  

Your primary responsibility will be user facing tools but as a key member
of the team you will also regularly work on the core services platform.
This means that you should be well-rounded and ready to debug JavaScript in
Firebug, develop complex CGI apps in Perl, build highly dynamic user
interfaces in JavaScript as well as knowing your way around the command
line and being able to jump in and help during emergencies, often in the
same day.

Required skills:
4+ years Perl experience 

Minimum of 4 years proven software development experience with at least 2
developing high traffic web applications. Preference for experience in a
LAMP environment. 

Demonstrated experience in developing software in a web application
environment. 

Significant experience developing web applications using Perl and Linux.
Mod_perl a plus. 

Experience with SQL, preferably in a Postgres environment. 

Understanding of deployment issues in a multi-tiered/multi-tenant hosted
environment. 

Ability to code in JavaScript. 

Ability to code in at least one additional language from the following
list: Java, Python, PHP, C, C++, .Net, C#, Ruby. 

Experience with CSS/HTML (in order to support client side developers, not
as a primary client side developer) 

Experience with object oriented programming, MVC and multi-tiered
architectures. 

Experience with CVS and SVN. 

Effective technical communication skills 

Willingness to join the on-call rotation. 

Comfort using vi, emacs, or other non-IDE editing tools and general comfort
at the command line. 

CS Degree
