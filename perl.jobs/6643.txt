Job title: Five Perl programmers

Company name: log - Open Source Consulting

Location: Portugal, Lisbon

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
log (and no, the "l" is not capitalized) is looking for some more Perl
programmers to strenghten its ranks.

The five programmers we're currently looking for have different sets of
skills and levels of expertise, but instead of making five different ads
that would probably go unnoticed, we're only making this one (which doesn't
mean it will be noticed, but at least we're not making life harder for
people trying to decide which position to apply for).

And no, it's not a project involving five people, it's several distinct
projects. Some of them are starting, some of them are already on the move
and in need of more people. And yes, we are aware of Brook's law.
Fortunately, we're a very organized and profissional team that doesn't have
a record of working nights or delivering past the due date. All these
positions were previously thought of.

But speaking of nights, it is true that we sometimes stay up late. You know
how it goes... Nobody's working, so we're not bothering anyone... We close
the windows, turn off the lights, put on the headphones... Man,
{Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory}++

But no, not all our programmers play... Only about half.

That said, check out www.log.pt. If you like what you see, if you meet the
required skills we're listing, if you reside in Lisbon or are willing to
move here, why don't you come talk to us?

Sincerely, log's Human Development team.

PS: No bots allowed.

Required skills:
The following are the required skills for these positions:

	- Perl, preferably OOP, and usage of CPAN
	- Confortable with development under Linux/UNIX
	- Experience with databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL preferred, but
Oracle also relevant)

As you can see, we're not asking much (at least so far).

Desired skills:
We're not looking for someone with *all* these skills, but any of these
sets are appreciated:

	- CPAN author
	- Perlmonks user (with some writeups, please)
	- Apache, mod_perl
	- TDD
	- SOAP, XML
	- Telnet, SNMPv2, TMF standards, OSS/BSS
	- Some knowledge (even if just theoritical) on NAT, BGP, IGMP, IP,
Ethernet
	- Experience with other languages, such as C, Java or PHP
	- Good written and spoken English
