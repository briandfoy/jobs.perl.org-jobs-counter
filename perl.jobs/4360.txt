Job title:
Senior Architect and Application Developer

Company name: Raybec Communications

Location: Canada, Ontario, Toronto

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Here we grow again!  Raybec Communications is looking for a Senior
Architect and Application Developer to join our web application development
team.  As a member of our team, you will be working on our web applications
based on existing design templates.

The primary objectives of this role are to:

• stabilize the existing application, participate in charting the course
for future development, and roll-up your sleeves to make it happen.
• help develop and enhance the functionality of our web-based applications,
increase performance, simplify the maintenance, bug fixing and extend
integration capabilities
• proactively identify performance optimization opportunities and implement
solutions before they negatively impact customers

You love working with other excellent people, but are equally comfortable
sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper and moulding reality. You know
that you can do the impossible if only you would be given a little bit more
time, but you also know you can accomplish a whole lot more if you work
with other really capable people.

You will help shape our development as we continue to grow and service some
of North America's largest organizations.  You will be responsible for
managing our existing application and participating in the further
development.  This position will suit an architect at heart who works well
under pressure and can think of new solutions and shortcuts.  You are able
to adapt and change as needed in a fast-paced environment and ideally have
prior start-up experience.


Required skills:
If you are the right candidate, you:

• live in the Toronto area
• have a minimum of 7 years experience developing web-based applications in
a commercial setting
• handle multiple projects at one time
• can work as a project team leader or as support, as needed
• are flexible about hours of work and location (some onsite, some
telecommute)
• have shown leadership in an Extreme Programming or Rapid Application
Development environment previously


Your technical skills must include:	

• Object Oriented Perl 5
• CGI::Application, HTML::Template
• DBI (MySQL)
• Strong familiarity with HTML, XML, JavaScript and CSS
• previous development of a database-backed web application
• Ability to formally communicate architectural designs and plans
• Converting project/client requirements into technical tasks and providing
estimates for these tasks 
• Drafting of Technical Architecture and Test Plans
