Description:
Undertake a variety of perl programming and support tasks. Liase with

modifications to existing applications. Perl is used for both CGI

this is full time employment and you will be treated as a regular employee.
Since we are few in number you can expect to be asked to tackle all aspects
of supporting the applications and Linux systems. We are more interested in
writing highly reliable ‘conventional’ code that we can all maintain and
you should find more satisfaction in delivering code / templates/ css  that
works first time than in getting your code into a few obfuscated lines.

Please feel free to send us examples of your code that we might enjoy
reading as well a links to any site to which you have made a significant
contribution.

You must be resident in the UK and be legally entitled to work here.

You will be required to meet monthly in London and work at Canvey Island,
Essex approx 1 day in each 4-6 weeks
