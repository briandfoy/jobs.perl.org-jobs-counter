coding conventions.  Emphasis is on producing clean and lean code that is
capable of functioning and scaling in highly demanding business

given a project.

The ideal candidate must have: 
Excellent application development skills

levels
Ability to work within a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment 
Ability to rely on sound application development principles, methodologies
and creativity when planning and accomplishing projects and goals

documentation/specifications.

Applicants should have demonstrable experience with:
Expert knowledge of Perl (preferred) or another scripting language such as
Python, PHP or Ruby 
Knowledge and regular use of source control.
Working knowledge of Catalyst MVC framework, DBIx::Class, and Moose
