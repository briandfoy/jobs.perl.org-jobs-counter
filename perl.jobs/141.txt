Subject: Seeking Contract Work in Utah
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: slloyd@inshift.com ("Steve Lloyd")

Hi folks,
I am now seeking full-time or part-time contract work in Utah for the next 1
to 3 months.
I am also willing to telecommute if that works.

I have extensive HTML, Perl development, and Software Quality Assurance
experience.
I have developed perl applications for Oracle, MySQL, MS-SQL, and Access
running on both Linux and Win32 platforms.
I have developed many applications including a full-blown commercial
web-based rapid-application-development platform called InOne.
