Job title: Perl Software Engineer

Company name: ZipRecruiter

Location: Los Angeles, CA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
ZipRecruiter is looking to expand our engineering team. We are a successful
bootstrapped startup that is profitable and growing rapidly.

We help employers and recruiters distribute their jobs online and screen
their applicants. We also provide job search engine and job alert email
services to job boards and related companies. We have a large number of
paying customers and job seekers using our services. You will have the
opportunity to lead significant projects. We pay market competitive
salaries and offer generous cash bonuses and equity. We are more laid back
than the average startup and more fun than the average BigCo - we're fans
of 37signals and we emulate a lot of what they talk about.

We're looking for strong generalist engineers who are happy to learn new
technologies, and are willing to think like product/business people who
personally implement software.

Required skills:
perl
unix command line
SQL
general web knowledge

Desired skills:
amazon web services
scalability
