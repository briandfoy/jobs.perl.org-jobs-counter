Job title:
Software Engineer/Data Analyst at a small, profitable web services company

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA, US

Pay rate: 70-120k USD, DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for a smart, mathematically minded
person to help make the Internet a safer place to do business. You are
either a programmer with deep analytical skills or a
mathematician/statistician/scientist with a programming bent. You will be
working on data analysis in order to improve our fraud detection service.
You'll be analyzing huge data sets to identify patterns of fraud, doing
quality assurance work on our fraud detection system, and thinking up new
ways to detect fraud.

We're a small, privately held company (under 20 employees) founded in 2002,
and we've been profitable for many years. As an employee of MaxMind, you'll
enjoy the flexibility and autonomy that come with being a member of a small
technical team. Since we are profitable, our focus is on exploring new
ideas and doing things well, rather than rushing work to market. We're a
casual, friendly, results-focused company. We want you to get things done,
but it's also important to have a life outside the office. We won't be
asking you to stay late or pull all-nighters on crazy deadlines.

Transaction fraud detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is
never done. Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection,
which means we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud
detection service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP
product, which associates geographical data with individual IP addresses.
We screen half a billion online transactions each year and provide IP
intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

Our office is located in downtown Waltham, MA outside of Boston, five
minutes walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus
lines. While local candidates are preferred, we will consider telecommuting
for an ideal candidate. If you are local, you'll be given a private office
and choice of computer.

The vast bulk of our code base is written in Perl using MySQL and Linux,
with a bit of C where it's needed. We use free software as much as
possible, and we release code back to the community when we can do so.
We're trying to improve the way we do development, and we expect you to
participate in that process. We've recently moved from CVS to Git. We've
just started a practice of doing all work on branches and code reviews.

We're open to applications from both junior and senior applicants. The
salary range for this position starts at $70k for junior level up to $120k
for a more experienced developer.

Minimum Qualifications:

Ability to work with large data sets, identify patterns, and crunch
numbers.
Prior programming experience, ideally with a scripting language such as
Perl, PHP, Python, or Ruby.
Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.
