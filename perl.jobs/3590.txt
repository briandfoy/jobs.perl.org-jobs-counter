Job title:

Company name: Examinetics

Description:
There's an open position for an experienced perl programmer / project lead
at the company I work for in Overland Park. (That's pretty much the Kansas
side of Kansas City, Missouri). It's a smallish health and occupational
safety testing company called Examinetics. The application that you would
be responsible for is a pretty large web-based application written in Mason
and running on MySQL.

As the lead developer for a similar project at Examinetics, I can assure
you that it's an interesting and satisfying programming position. The code
is organized and sensible, but large; you won't be micromanaged; you don't
have to do (much) external customer service stuff; the pay is good; and
you're looking out for people's health. What could be better?


Required skills:
+ Extensive knowledge of Apache and mod_perl.  Two or three major mod_perl
projects.
+ In-depth experience with Linux/UNIX and desire to work with open source
technology - LAMP developers.
+ Excellent knowledge of object oriented perl.
+ 4+ years of experience in web site and software application development
in UNIX/Linux environment.
+ MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle DB experience required.
+ Working knowledge of HTML, HTTP, SSL, TCP/IP, DNS and other
applicable protocols and technologies.
+ Bachelors degree in Computer Science or related field or equivalent
experience.
+ Project Management and life cycle development experience.
+ Strong communication and problem solving skills.


Desired skills:
+ Experience with multiple applications, branched development and code
sharing in CVS or subversion (svn)
+ Experience with HTML::Mason
+ Unit testing or test-driven development
+ Proficiency in JavaScript, CSS and shell scripting
