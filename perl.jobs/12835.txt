Job title: Senior web developer in fast growing startup

Company name: 15gifts

Location: Brighton, United Kingdom

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
15gifts offers intelligent decision engine software that can be integrated
to any eCommerce website to boost conversion rates and generate invaluable
consumer insights — helping customers quickly find their ideal product.

We are an exciting startup company that's growing rapidly and we now work
with some of the biggest corporations and SME's in the UK including Virgin
Media, Orange, Ernest Jones & T-Mobile.

A little about the role we want to fill:

Following significant growth over the last six months, we are now looking
for a fantastic developer to join our fast growing team. Whilst the company
is based in Brighton (UK) we are more interested in finding exceptional
people so we are happy to work remotely if you’re the ideal candidate.

You should have experience developing software for large scale web projects
and should be comfortable with Linux servers, relational databases and
dynamic web interfaces. You should be excellent at finding creative
solutions for challenging problems, write elegant code and be efficient
with algorithms.

Our technology stack consists of nginx, Apache, mod_perl and MySQL. The
code is based on our own mature web framework and is managed by Subversion.
As our software continues to evolve and grow we want to remain flexible
with our stack and you, as one of the first hires in the development team,
will have a unique chance to influence and optimise this directly.

What we’d offer the successful candidate:

- A very competitive salary and bonuses
- A hugely exciting opportunity to be an early employee in a fast growing
company
- The opportunity to work with top level developers and designers
- A fun, relaxed and informal work ethos
- The opportunity to input into all aspects of the business technology
- The time to create and develop your own ideas
- Your birthdays off work

Required skills:
- 5+ years experience creating large web projects with Perl
- 3+ years experience creating web interfaces with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery
- Database, application architecture and software systems design experience

- Excellent problem solving abilities, a firm grasp on algorithms and
rock-solid computer science fundamentals
- Fluent spoken and written English

Desired skills:
Experience in server setup and administration (particularly Amazon EC2,
RDS, etc) is a big plus, but not a requirement.
