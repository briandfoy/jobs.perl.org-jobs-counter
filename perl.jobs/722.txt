Job title:
WebGUI/DBI Programmers for multiple components

Company name: Broadspire, Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Mission Hills

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Depends on Project

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are currently seeking perl programmers with strong WebGUI CGI experience
and unix administration skills to develop module components within our
internet service management platform.  Our first project we are offering
for bid is a simple Squirrel Mail configuration module.  If you are
interested in doing module programming within an pre-defined environment
(as opposed to "ground up" development), please contact me and I will be
happy to provide the specifications and discuss this project further.

Regards,
Karyn Ulriksen, Systems Architect

Mission Hills, CA  91345  USA
Phone:	818-920-1200

Email:	karyn@broadspire.com



Required skills: Perl and Perl::DBI, CGI, DHTML, and SQL.

Desired skills:
Although this first module component, the GUI for the Squirrel Mail
Configuration module component only requires Perl, Perl::DBI, CGI, SQL, and
DHTML.	Additional programming opportunities may require either senior
level familiarity with unix administration (Linux, Freebsd, Solaris,
Tru64).  Microsoft service management is on the board but has not been
scheduled at this time.
