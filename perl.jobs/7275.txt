Job title:
Workflow Coordinator -- ImageMagick & Perl

Company name: Masterfile Corporation

Location: Canada, Ontario, Toronto

Pay rate: commensurate with experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Based in Toronto, Canada, Masterfile is one of the world's largest
independent stock photo agencies. We acquire, organize, distribute and
license images for commercial use in media ranging from print advertising
to websites. With the Masterfile web site selling images around the clock
and a collection exceeding one million images, our need for ingenuity has
never been higher.

As Masterfile's image collection grows, we need to efficiently manage an
increasingly complex workflow. We are seeking a detail-oriented, motivated
and adaptable individual for the position of Workflow Coordinator. The
successful candidate will operate, maintain and improve various automated
image processing workflows, running on Mac OS X.

These workflows are implemented as scripts -- written in Perl and
AppleScript -- which automate the ingestion, processing and publishing of
very large numbers of image files, using ImageMagick and Photoshop.

This entry level position is a great opportunity to learn about -- and
contribute to -- a high-volume production environment.

Responsibilities:

- Operate and maintain various digital image processing workflows which
handle a large volume of image files daily
- Improve, adapt and optimize image processing workflows 
- Validate and manage metadata in databases and text files
- Monitor image quality to ensure correct colour and data integrity
- Handle ad hoc image processing requests 
- Communicate and work with Masterfile staff, image suppliers and
distributors regarding image processing and content syndication
- Research image processing and workflow technology and practices to
further improve quality and efficiency


Required skills:
- At least 1 year experience writing scripts for workflow automation using
Perl or other scripting languages
- Knowledge of Unix and shell scripting (we are using Mac OSX); must be
comfortable on the command line
- Understanding of Internet protocols: HTTP, FTP, SSH
- Knowledge of Adobe Photoshop – especially colour management and
automation 
- Understanding of colour management (e.g. ICC profiles), image files
formats and image compression
- Knowledge of SQL and Microsoft Server or MySQL would be an asset
- Experience with command line image processing tools, such as ImageMagick,
would be an asset
- Experience with production workflows, e.g. pre-press workflows, would be
an asset
- Excellent interpersonal skills are required
