Job title:
Guten Tag, Senior Perl Developers! Perl role in South Germany

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: Saarland OR Telecommute, ideally from Germany

Pay rate: Depending on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Bricks-and-mortar shopping was going the way of the dodo before the
pandemic started, but boy, did COVID accelerate it. If you=E2=80=99re a Sen=
ior Perl
Developer searching for an extinction-proof role, you=E2=80=99ve come to th=
e right
place.

With more than 4 million domains spanning nearly every country
around the globe, our client manages over 100,000 retail and corporate
clients and 2,300 resellers. That=E2=80=99s a whole lot of carts and bags b=
rimming
with goodies, which translates into enviable job security and money in your
pocket.

You=E2=80=99ll design and develop software solutions, optimize the backend
system, help expand the TLD offer, test software, and engage in good old
fashioned problem-solving for technical issues identified by clients and
partners.

Bricks-and-mortar malls may be pass=C3=A9 but having a real-time
office to come to when the pandemic ends is a major perk. While work for
this client is currently 100% remote, their main office is in St. Ingbert,
Germany with a satellite office in Munich. With a friendly, sociable crew,
a rooftop deck, and all the table soccer and air hockey you can handle,
you=E2=80=99ll make fast friends with your new team (once you=E2=80=99re al=
lowed within two
metres of each other).

Think you=E2=80=99d like to join this team of table-sport
superstars? Here=E2=80=99s who they say is their dream match: experienced i=
n the
implementation of existing APIs and protocols, you=E2=80=99ve got Perl or P=
HP
skills, an independent and flexible attitude, and strong written and spoken
English. Bonus points for fluency in other languages, and as you might
imagine, knowledge of German will win you high-fives all around.

Ready to
join the online shopping revolution? Shoot us an email and let us know why
you=E2=80=99re perfect for this role, and we=E2=80=99ll say danke schoen.

Desired skills:
The ideal candidate should be confident using Modern Perl, in particular
happy with DBIx::Class and Moose/Moo. Experience with any of mod_perl,
Net::Server, Ubuntu, MySQL, Elastic Search, and memcached would be
advantageous.
