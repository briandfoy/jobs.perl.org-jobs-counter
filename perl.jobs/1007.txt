Description:
FastMail.FM (http://www.fastmail.fm), one of the world's leading e-mail
services, is hiring an expert Perl programmer to become a Web Application
Developer. In this very attractive senior position, you can work flexible
hours, telecommute, and develop your skills as part of a small but very
experienced programming team. You will be primarily responsible for
creating "cool new stuff" for the FastMail.FM web interface - no meetings
with marketing to attend, no "team building exercises" to get dragged along
to..., you'll be just *writing* *code* !

Required skills:
To join our team, you will need to be an expert in Perl, object-oriented
programming, and Web development.

Desired skills:
Ideally, you will have substantial experience with mod_perl in a production
environment. As a committed programmer, you should be able to show us an
impressive portfolio of your work, such as in open source projects,
contributing to the Perl community, or developing new frameworks in a
commercial context.
