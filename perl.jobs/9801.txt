Job title: Pipelines Web Developer

Company name: Holophrastic Enterprises Inc.

Location: Canada, Ontario, Toronto

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: long-term, career-oriented

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Pipelines is our internal and proprietary web development platform --
written on top of Perl, of course.  Call it a template language if you
must, but basically it automates away 90% of typical web development --
connecting to the database, user logins, security, user preferences, et
cetera.  It also throws umbrella features over everything.  It's really
cool.

As most of pipelines pulls from the world of Perl, and it's perl core is
constantly upgraded, Perl developers are particularly suited to this job --
actually a career.  Pipelines includes dozens of sub-syntax languages of
natures similar to regular expressions, so if you can parse a regular
expression in your head, cryptic as it may be, pipelines becomes crazy
easy.

Work is explosive now, so we're hiring immediately.  It is expected that
you'll take  afew months to get up to speed -- the learning curve is quite
steep, but the work itself is really easy, and we have a lot of fun with
it.

Required skills:
raw perl (no modules), javascript, mysql, html, css.  An understanding of
the general flow of a web-site from database, to backend server, to output
stream, to browser client and back again.  An understanding of the general
problems in web development like caching and speed and security.

Desired skills:
jscript, english writing, regular expressions, basic graphic work
(cropping, colour correction, sizing, compressing)
