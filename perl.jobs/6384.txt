Job title:
Perl superstar with strong networking experience

Company name: Lok Technology

Location: United States, CA, San Jose

Pay rate: up to $150k

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are crazy, and not just in the typical startup sense.  Yes, we do all of
the usual crazy startup things.  We work insane hours.	We live in the
office.  We also are speed addicts.  We own RS4s, M3s, GTIs and the like,
and we regularly terrorize the roads.  We snowboard, a lot.
We drive at triple digit speeds to get to and from Tahoe at 3 AM, and yes,
we sustain the triple digit speeds through the mountains.  When we get a
chance, we climb onboard helicopters to go snowboarding.  We also eat well.
 When we go to Whistler, we eat at Umberto's and Araxi.
When we go to Vail, we east at Sweet Basil and La Tour.  If we're at Tahoe,
we can't miss The Naked Fish.  

Are you nuts?  Do you like insane speeds?  Do you like to ski or ride?	Can
you land 180s?	How about motorcycles?	Sky diving? White water rafting? 
Are you the kind of person who doesn't feel right unless you go to the gym
at least 5 days a week?  Do you also happen to be a software engineer,
architect, developer programmer or whatever else they call a coder these
days?  Do you know Perl and lots about networking?  If so, Lok Technology
may be the place for you.

We are looking to expand our technical team.  Our first and more important
qualification is culture.  We are looking for people who will fit into our
world of insanity.  We are also looking for people with some of the
skills below.  If you don't have them all, that may be okay, you will just
have to learn them fast.  

Why join us?  Because we have a lot of fun.  Because you want to have a
hand at working on some of the coolest projects in our space. The average
person has a "problem" and encounters "stress" when they have to work a few
more hours a week without over time.  We have real problems and real
stress.  Our team is small so each and every thing you do has a direct
effect on hundreds of the largest
revenue generating public access Wi-Fi networks in the world.  When you
join us, you take part in the team that runs the Wi-Fi at Hartsfield
Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport in the world, as
well as the network that covers the entire resort and surrounding
communities at Vail, Colorado.	You won't be some
little cog in a big machine.  You won't have walls between you and the real
deal. 

Bachelor's degree required.  Master's and/or Ph.D. preferred.  Only
exceptional candidates with multiple graduate degrees and significant
experience in all of the above areas will qualify for the top pay rate. 
We're still interested in you even if you don't have it all.
