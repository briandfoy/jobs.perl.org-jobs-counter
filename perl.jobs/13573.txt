Job title: Front-end developer with Perl experience

Company name: All Around The World

Location: Hanover, Germany

Pay rate: competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is Ovid and I'm looking for a front-end developer who can hack his or
her own Perl backend for a company in Hanover, Germany. Work permit or Blue
Card assistance is provided, along with a relocation package. 

The company is a large, stable, profitable business and they've been around
for over a decade. They want strong Perl devs to help them refactor a
legacy system into a modern one. Instead of open plan, the company has two
to three developers per office. Hours are flexible and you'll get sent to
conferences if you want. You'll get the best hardware to hack on and when
you're enjoying Hanover's low cost of living, you'll also get 30 days of
vacation to enjoy the rest of Europe. 

Hanover is a beautiful, bike-friendly, mid-sized town in the north of
Germany. The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high. It's a
green-friendly town and hosts one of the largest Oktoberfests in the world.
While we're listing "desired" skills, keep in mind that the company is
happy to be flexible on most of this so long as you can convince them that
you can help improve their systems.

Required skills:
- Very comfortable with HTML/CSS and JavaScript (and jQuery)
- You should not be afraid of Perl and are willing to hack it from time to
time (the more Perl, the better)
- Experience with AJAX, XML, JSON and SOAP
- You understand what makes a Web site easy to use
- You understand how to write efficient, cross-browser code
- You speak English

Desired skills:
- You are familiar with Web Analytics and A/B testing tools
- Familiarity with Linux
- Speaking German's a plus, but not mandatory (the company will help you
with German lessons). 
- Appreciating great German beer is nice. 
- Familiarity with agile development.
- You don't drool on your t-shirt
