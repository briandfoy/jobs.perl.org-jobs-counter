Job title: System Engineer / Administrator

Company name: Bio-Tech Medical Software, Inc.

Location: Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, USA

Pay rate: Dollars

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Bio-Tech Medical Software, Inc. is looking to hire a full-time System
Engineer / Administrator for its dev-ops team.	Based in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida, the position reports directly to the CIO and offers a competitive
compensation package and benefits to the successful applicant, commensurate
with experience. The successful applicant will be well-versed in Linux
technologies related to dynamic, database-backed web application servers
authored in Perl, with a background in at least one configuration
management framework like puppet, ansible or chef.  Familiarity with AWS is
a plus; as are experience with git, open source software, and Atlassian
products and services.

Responsibilities include supporting developers and
other employees in their use and application of technology and associated
IT policies, internal network administration and router/firewall
configuration.	Administration, routine maintenance, and system upgrades of
all server assets are common tasks, as is a contribution to the development
of documented IT policies and procedures to which all employees must
adhere.

As a central colleague in our dev-ops team, the successful
applicant will have a degree of latitude in researching new technologies to
introduce to the company.  Quality work, attention to detail, and excellent
team communication skills are a must.  This position requires participation
in our on-call rotation, and frequently requires work to be performed at
off-peak hours to avoid interruption of service to our customers.  Periodic
telecommuting is an option, though routine on-site participation at HQ is
required for this job.



Bio-Tech Medical Software, Inc. is an
equal-opportunity employer.  We will train successful applicants who are
missing a few areas of the desired background above, so motivated
individuals who are self-managing with a strong work ethic should consider
applying regardless of work history.

Desired skills: Perl, git, VMware, postgresql, httpd, puppet
