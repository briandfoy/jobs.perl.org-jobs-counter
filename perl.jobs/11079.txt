Job title:
"End-to-End" Web Programmer (OO Perl/Linux/MySQL/jQuery) for UK's #1 News
Portal

Company name: www.NewsNow.co.uk

Internal ID: 20110307

Location: United Kingdom, West London

Pay rate: £ competitive rate (neg.dep.exp.)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
NewsNow - Britain's largest home-grown news aggregator, 2nd only to Google
News in the UK - is hiring. We are looking for one or more smart cookies
who can help us take our award-winning and highly popular news website to
the next level.

They will be exceedingly talented and agile individuals, who can design and
build database-driven websites on Linux (ideally Debian) from end-to-end;
programming the back-end in object-oriented fashion (OO Perl), and building
aesthetically pleasing front end user interfaces in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Ajax (using jQuery). Ideally, they can write neat copy and manipulate
artwork too (using e.g. GIMP). They will have an explorer mentality, so
they'll already be familiar with a wide variety of common Linux packages
(useful in case one of them does something we need), and will be able to
help administer our Linux server farm.

New recruits will have a degree from a top university, preferably in
mathematics or computing science and/or equivalent work experience. They
will complement our strong IT team, based at our smart offices in West
London. Since some members of the team work remotely, the people we're
looking for will be comfortable discussing not only their progress but also
the assumptions underlying their project development strategy, by telephone
and jabber, as well as face-to-face.

This is a wide-ranging role, with plenty of variety. NewsNow is looking for
people able to start in May/June. The closing date for applications in the
current round, is Tuesday 15 March.

Required skills:
OO Perl, Debian/Ubuntu Linux, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and an
eye for design.

Desired skills:
GIMP/Photoshop, C/C++, TCP/IP Socket Programming, VPNs, Bind/DNS, Apache2,
DHCP, VMware/KVM, Amazon S3/EC2/CloudFront.
