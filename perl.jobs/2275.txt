Description:
Our client, a leading provider of financial information, requires a Senior
Perl Developer to join a mixed skill set team working on both NT and Unix

involved in the position. Applicants will have at least 7 years of
experience within IT and have experience of developing Unix (Solaris) based
applications using Perl as well as developing and maintaining Web
infrastructure layers using a combination of Perl, MOD Perl and Apache.
Candidates must have experience of MOD Perl, Apache, Unix (Solaris), OO
Perl, third line Unix support and XML manipulation using XSL. UML is also a
required skill as is knowledge of SQL/relational databases (preferably
oracle), experience of content management systems and CVS administration.
Allegis Group is an employment business and agency.

Required skills: PERl, mod_perl, XML/XSL
