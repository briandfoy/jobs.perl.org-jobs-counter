Description:
About Eatoni

Text entry for mobile devices is the "tipping point" technology for the
mobile internet. You need to be able to enter text quickly and easily using
a very small device. It needs to work in any language. It needs
to be reliable.

Eatoni has been working for over 6 years to make such technology available.
We've developed a good customer base and are profitable. Major products in
the works.

We are looking for someone to run and build out our core integration
software.
You will also be
1) involved in research and development efforts to increase the reliability
and efficiency of our text entry methods.  We are constantly making
improvements and expanding our linguistic repertoire.

2) dealing directly with customers to deliver software built to their
specifications.

This is a dream job for people who

*care about the mobile internet
*care about linguistics
*think clean and powerful code is beautiful
*like New York City
*thrive in a small-company environment

Eatoni is seeking an exceptional senior developer to help build our next
generation of text-entry software. The position requires the combination of
strong theoretical understanding of algorithms and practical experience in
building large configurable and yet reliable systems in OO perl.
At the same time, you must have the ability to produce efficient
implementations that will be integrated into millions of devices by major
manufacturers. Ideally you will have a graduate degree in computer science,
with studies involving operating systems or algorithms and data structures.
The ideal candidate will also have
considerable experience working as a C programmer in a low-level
environment. The interview process will
require you to write code to demonstrate this knowledge.

Please do not apply unless you are extremely confident that your background
is well aligned with our needs and that your depth of technical
understanding will withstand close scrutiny. Please do not claim to have
experience in an area below unless you have worked in that area. It's not
enough to have read a book or heard about an issue, we're looking for solid
prior experience.

If you haven't been frightened away yet, you may either be not reading
carefully or be very good. In the case of the latter, look around
www.eatoni.com. In your cover letter, give us at least one good reason why
you and Eatoni are a good match. Submissions which do not meet this
criterion will hit the spam filter.

If you are interested in applying, we will need some sizable samples of
code (in Perl and preferably also C)
for analysis. There is really no substitute for this.

If possible, send samples of your finest work.	However, we recognize that
code is written under varying constraints and for very different reasons
and at different stages in one's career. Therefore, if there is
anything you wish to tell us about your code, please include this. For
example, if the code was produced under time pressure, if there are things
you would now do differently (and why), if your coding style has changed,
if looking at your code you see other shortcomings or even bugs etc.


Required skills:
- A sophisticated knowledge of OO-Perl.
- Minimum 7 years programming in C.
- At least a masters degree, better a Ph.D., in computer science,
engineering, mathematics, physics or similar.
- Full cycle product implementation, from outlines of algorithms to
shipping code.
- Good understanding of basic data structures
  and algorithms: searching, trees, hashes, tries, etc.
- Completely at ease working in a UNIX environment.
- Desire to ship products and work in a small team

Desired skills:
- API design.
- HCI / User interface.
- Configuration management.
- Automated testing and quality assurance.
- Understanding of compilers.
- Work in a startup environment.
- Embedded device programming.
- Other programming languages, especially C++ or Java.
- Other systems knowledge: TCP/IP and other internet protocols,
   client/server architectures, operating systems background, experience
   programming for small/portable devices, knowledge of CPU architectures
   such as the 8051, CR16, ARM.
- ability to contribute on the sys-admin front when required.
- i18n issues.
- Computational linguistics.
- Asian or Indic languages.
