Job title:
Object-Oriented Perl Perl DBI MySQL Mason Apache Programmer

Company name: iWebmasters.com

Internal ID: iWebperl

Location: Philippines, Makati City

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
iWebmasters.com is a startup programmer and design staff leasing company
That is always hiring the best programmers, creative designers and writers
to build cutting edge websites for our clients abroad. We have the clients.
You have the skills. Let's talk. Come join our fast growing team of 
professionals.	


OPEN INTERVIEWS
Monday to Friday  9am-12pm & 2pm-5pm
EVENING HOURS
Tuesday and Thursday 7pm-9pm
(PLEASE BRING YOUR PORTFOLIO)

Unit 807 Antel 2000 Corp. Offices, 121 Valero St., Makati City		   
    Telephone no. 750-0577


Required skills:
I am interested in possibly getting a programmer to work for us. Here are
the details of the qualifications;

 

1) Object-Oriented Perl

2) Unix (preferably FreeBSD, but any Unix OS will work)

3) Perl DBI (Perl module for interfacing with databases)

4) MySQL (we could consider someone with experience with another relational
database, but we would definitely prefer MySQL)


Desired skills:
5) Mason

6) Apache

Since they aren't going to be doing any administration work, familiarity
with Apache isn't detrimental.	It would be ideal if this person was
familiar with Mason, but depending on where he or she is with the other
skills listed, they may be able to learn Mason fairly quickly.	If we could
get a sample of any code they've written that would be great.  In fact, I
would like a code sample that demonstrates their familiarity with
Object-Oriented Perl and/or their ability to use the DBI module.
