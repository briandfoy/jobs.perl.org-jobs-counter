Pay rate: £30,000 to £35,000

Description:
Online Galleries are hiring again.  We're looking for someone to join a 3
person team to build, extend and maintain a selection of websites for art
and antique dealers.

You'll need to know the usual sort of stuff - Perl (including TT), MySQL,
Apache, Linux.	We're using (and extending) the Metadot CMS, so if you've
seen it before then that's an advantage - but if you haven't then don't
worry, it's easy to pick up.

Our offices are in Hoxton Square (nearest tube is Old Street).	We have an
hour of flexitime, so you can start at any time up to ten if mornings
aren't your speciality.  We're offering a salary of 30-35k depending on
ability and/or experience.

There's some info about Online Galleries here:
http://onlinegalleries.com/

This is our main website project:
http://cinoa.org/

(CINOA is an international federation of national associations of art and
antique dealers - we also run sites for some of the national associations,
and for a rapidly increasing number of individual dealers)


UK residents only please, and direct applicants only.  That means NO
AGENCIES, thank you.


Required skills:
Perl (including Template Toolkit), MySQL, Linux, HTML

Desired skills: Metadot, Subversion
