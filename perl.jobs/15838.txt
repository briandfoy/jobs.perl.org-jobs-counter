Job title: Senior Perl Web Developer

Company name: IntelliTree Solutions

Location: Cincinnati, OH, USA

Pay rate: 100k to 150k USD, DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
IntelliTree Solutions is a small consultancy specializing in
database-driven web apps and solutions. We develop, extend and maintain
various kinds of systems and applications for our clients on a medium to
long-term basis. Some projects last only 6 months, while others are ongoing
for 10+ years. Our clients range from manufacturing to service to
financial. We've developed a reputation for coming up with creative and
innovative solutions to tough problems and delivering results for our
clients. 

We're a strong open-source shop and our team members frequently
contribute to CPAN and speak at YAPC. This is very important to us and we
don't normally take projects from clients who are unwilling to open-source
code (excluding of course their proprietary business methods, which are
generally only a small portion of the work).

We're looking for a motivated
and experienced developer to join our team on a full-time basis. 

This
position is for a senior-level developer with exceptional design and
programming skills with at least 10 years of relevant experience. Potential
candidates should be creative, detail-oriented, have strong communication
skills, be well organized, and be self-starters. We need someone who can
take ownership and exercise leadership, work directly with the client,
overcome challenges and push projects successfully across the finish line.

Desired skills:
We're primarily a Perl shop, and so strong proficiency in modern Perl is
expected. Our primary stack usually consists of Moo/Moose, DBIx::Class,
Catalyst, Plack and ExtJS. Experience with any/all of those tools is a big
plus, but since technology is a moving target that is ever evolving, strong
foundations and conceptual understandings are much more important. It's
less about what you already know than what you are able to pick up. Every
new application/endeavor is its own, new R&D project and always involves
learning some new technology and coming up with new and innovative
solutions to problems. Our philosophy is that every project should break
new ground and move the art forward in some manner. At the same time, it is
critical that innovation be balanced with stability, and that all
production implementations meet high standards for dependability and
reliability.

While we don't require direct experience with any specific
library/tool, we do expect experience and strong proficiency in developing
*something* in key areas (for example, we don't expect you to know Postgres
specifically, but we do expect you to know some RDBMS). Here are a few of
the areas of focus that are most important to us:

Relational databases
Object-oriented design
MVC
REST APIs
Test-driven
development/continuous-integration
Back-end development
Front-end
development
JavaScript/Ajax/CSS/HTML 
User-interface design
Optimization/performance tuning/scalability
Refactoring/legacy-code
Filesystems
Linux
Web servers
DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP 
Deployment (Docker, VMs,
etc)

We are very interested in hearing - in detail - about the projects,
implementations and creative solutions that you've come up with in the
past, as well as any code you can share. Being an open-source developer
with projects on GitHub and CPAN is a huge plus.
