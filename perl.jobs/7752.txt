and capably grapple with competing priorities and demands.  You'll need
demonstrable experience of enterprise architecture design and related

top-notch coder.    Candidates must be experienced, creative, flexible and
self-motivated, with a flair for writing reliable, maintainable code.

You'd be working entirely from home on equipment and broadband provided by
IMDb, and you'd need to be able to attend a weekly pub lunch and other
meetings with the rest of the team in Bristol.

IMDb is the biggest, best, most award-winning movie site on the planet.
It's currently the #17 most popular site in the U.S. and #16 in the UK

programming experience.
    * Experience in designing/developing large highly-scalable enterprise
systems.
    * Evidence of excellent API design and architecture skills and an
up-to-date understanding of current best-practises.
    * Proficient in at least one OO language (Java, C++, Perl, etc.) and at
least one scripting language.	For candidates without intimate Perl
experience, we will be looking for evidence of adaptability and preferably
experience in a related language.
    * Proficient in a UNIX/Linux environment
    * Fluent English, solid communication skills and the ability to work
well in a team are critical.


Desired skills:
    * Experience of SQL, unit testing, web services would count in your
favour, as would relevant advanced competencies like distributed systems,

processing etc.
    * Experience of mentoring and code/design reviews preferred.
