Job title:
Need help learning the PDF::API2 module. Will pay cash$$$

Company name: Garrett Casey

Location: United States, New Jersey, Hoboken

Pay rate: $30 an Hour

Travel: 75-100%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: < 10 hours

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
I am an experience perl programmer.  I currently have a script that
generates a variable length text file.	I would like to update the program
so that a PDF file is generated.  I have installed the PDF::API2 on my
server, but I am having difficulty learning the module.  I need to
collaborate with someone on this project so I can better learn the
PDF::API2 module and, of course, rewrite the program to generate the
required PDF files.

I can install any version of the module on my FreeBSD server (hence I do
not use windows).

You must be experienced with using the PDF::API2 module.

The resulting PDF files must include formatted paragraphs, tables, line
charts (generated on the fly) and images.  So, obviously you should know
how this is done.

I would prefer someone that I can meet in person.  I live in the New York
City area.  If not, we can communicate via video/telephone conferencing.  

I will pay you an hourly rate for your help and guidance.


Required skills: PDF::API2
