Job title:
Senior Perl Developer / Sysadmin with Strong Perl (contract)

Company name: Broadbean Technology

Location: Canary Wharf, London, UK

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3-6 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for at least one talented Senior Perl Developer with Sysadmin
experience – or a Senior Sysadmin with strong Perl experience, to join our
Infrastructure team in our lovely Canary Wharf offices. You’ll be working
on directly – or helping to support - an ambitious project involving AWS.
You’ll be helping to continue split apart a product in to services, working
with a high-availability system, and getting Puppet to do your bidding.

We build a Software As A Service product for recruiters, and have 60%-70%
of the UK market depending on who you ask. We're a smallish company (90
people in the UK, 40 in California, a handful in Sydney) owned by a much
larger company. Work will be onsite in Canary Wharf, 9-6.

Required skills:
You'll need to show proof of strong and "Modern" Perl - at least
familiarity with various testing modules, exposure to Moose would be
useful. You’ll need to show understanding and experience of Sysadmin on
Linux, with Puppet and/or AWS experience being a real bonus.
