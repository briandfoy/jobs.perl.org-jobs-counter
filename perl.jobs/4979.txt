Description:
Barclays Global Investors (BGI) is America’s largest money manager,
providing structured investment strategies such as indexing,

worldwide. For 35 years, BGI has been at the forefront of developing
innovative investment ideas, applying science and technology to the

We are seeking a Perl developer to help us modernize a legacy portfolio
management system.  This will involve removing unecessary code, migrating
from Perl 4 to Perl 5 coding styles, applying best-practices and coding
standards, refactoring/rewriting procedural code into object-oriented
services, reorganizing system into functional components and distributions.


This is an excellent opportunity to sharpen Perl skills and learn about
Equity Portfolio Managment.  We are small team of developers filling many
roles in the development cycle.  We practice pair and solo programming, use
automated builds and continuous integration, and have a small but growing
repository of tests.

Required skills:
Writing object-oriented and procedural Perl code.
Using source-code management tools (SVN, CVS).
Working in a Unix command-line environment.
Developing with SQL and DBI.

Desired skills:
Refactoring tools and techniques.
Using Perl's testing tools.
Creating CPAN modules.
