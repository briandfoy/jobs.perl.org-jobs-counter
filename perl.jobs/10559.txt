SolveMedia is looking to add a few Jr. Developers to our small team of
dedicated Perl / Unix engineers. We need A+ talent.  If you use a Windows
PC you better have a good reason why!  If you are a developer that does not
feel comfortable in VIM, Emacs or some other Unix text editor do not apply.
 If you have never compiled apache w/mod_perl don't apply.  

Check out our help section:  http://bit.ly/perl_jobs

If you would be afraid to, from scratch, develop + test a plug-in for our
API in less than day or so DO NOT APPLY for this job. 

The team at Solve knows that we are onto something big.  We need people
that realize that too and will work their hearts out to make it successful.
 Are you that person?  Apply now if you are!

Required skills:
Perl
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
SQL

Desired skills:
C++
Mason
Flash Action Script

We support lots of plug-ins.  So experience with lots of languages is
beneficial.  Comfort with NEW things daily should be innate.
