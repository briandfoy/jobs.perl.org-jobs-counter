Job title: Senior Web Applications Developer

Company name: Marigold Technologies, LLC

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: TBD

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Marigold Technologies is looking for an experienced perl developer to join
our small, growing development team in the creation of a large-scale
business web application.  The project is three years into development, and
is built around MySQL, Mason and Alzabo. 

As our ideal candidate, you have thorough, solid experience developing web
apps with Mason and MySQL (or another RDBMS) and lots of experience working
with, and possibly developing CPAN modules.  You also have excellent
communication skills, and enjoy articulating deep technical design ideas,
as opposed to seeing this sort of thing as a burden. 

Virtually 100% of the work can be done remotely.  The only travel
requirement is for an initial face-to-face meeting, and for possible
face-to-face meetings with other team members approximately once a year.  

Our group is accustomed to working remotely, using email, IM, CVS, SVN, RT
and the like. Our ideal candidate is already accustomed to this sort of
work arrangement, and has a good deal of experience working autonomously as
such. 

We're looking for someone who is interested in joining us full-time, on a
long-term basis, probably beginning with a test project under a contracting
arrangement.

We are a tight-knit group that believes in having fun, working hard, and
rewarding ourselves to suit.  We do this by creating very scalable
incentive plans that reward intense levels of effort.  That being said, we
also don't believe in working ourselves to death.  (been there, done
that..) 

Marigold Technologies is a small, profitable LLC, based in New York City. 


Required skills:
-OO Perl
-Mason
-SQL
-Linux

Desired skills:
-CPAN module development
-Alzabo (alzabo.org)
-Familiarity with Debian
-Experience developing email clients and servers

Contact information:
To apply, submit your resume (or a URL that points to it) to
dev-jobs@contactbook.net.  Detailed information about why this sounds like
the absolute >perfect< job for you are appreciated as well.  We look
forward to hearing from you.
