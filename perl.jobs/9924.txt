Description:
ARUBA NETWORKS - People Move. Networks must follow. 

Founded in 2002, Aruba Networks securely delivers networks to users,
wherever they work or roam. Our unified mobility solutions include Wi-Fi
networks, identity-based security, remote access and cellular services, and
centralized multi-vendor network management that enable the Follow-Me
Enterprise that moves in lock-step with users.
 
The cost, convenience, and security benefits of our unified mobility
solutions are fundamentally changing how and where we work. Listed on the
NASDAQ and Russell 2000 Index, Aruba is based in Sunnyvale, California, and
has operations throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Asia
Pacific regions.

== Software Engineer ==

AirWave Wireless, a division of Aruba Networks in Sunnyvale, is looking for
a full-time Software Engineer to join our team. We develop network
management software is used by many Fortune 500 companies, major
universities, hospitals and other prominent institutions worldwide. Our
industry-leading software helps customers plan, configure, manage and
monitor some of the largest wireless networks on the planet.

Our team practices extreme programming (XP) so we spend most of our time
writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback loops speak
louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings. We
believe in test-driven development and have a comprehensive suite of tests
to prove it – 31,000 at last count! We pair program, so you will learn the
system quickly (and have fun while doing it), and our short release cycle
means your code will be out in the field within a few weeks. In fact, our
project has been cited as the longest running continuous XP project in the
industry (six years and counting)!

Airwave developers write software in several different languages, 
primarily OO Perl on Linux. We use apache mod_perl2 for our front-end and
PostgreSQL for back-end persistence. Since our system manages network
devices we also have to know our way around SNMP, TFTP, HTTP, etc.

Job Responsibilities:

Your responsibilities will include designing, writing, testing, and
maintaining code that is part of a shipping enterprise network management
and monitoring software package.


Required skills:
Job Requirements:

This role requires strong Perl, OO and refactoring and design skills.
Additional experience should include exposure to Apache mod_perl, SQL,
Linux and automated test development. Exposure to agile software
development and  tcp/ip and/or wireless networking is ideal but not
required.
