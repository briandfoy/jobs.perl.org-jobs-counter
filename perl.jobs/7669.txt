Job title: optimization specialist

Location: Kuwiat, Kuwait

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a website designed in Perl based on LAMP architecture. I need an
optimization expert to go through it and improve performance issues.
Hosting, proxy, directory structure, scripts, DB performance, memory,
CSS/HTML will have to be looked into with a fine-tooth comb.

Before starting, I will need a "current state" assessment. I will also need
comparative reports after the optimization is done.

Bottom line is that any page on my website should load within 4ms and my
website should load faster than 99.95% sites out there on the internet.

It goes without saying that all this has to be done within the confines of
the existing hardware/software. Any new financial investments are out of
the question.


Required skills:
Linux - Apache - MySQL - Perl

Networking, proxy, memory, CSS/HTML

Reporting (there is a difference between reports and data...I need reports
that I can make sense out of...not mountains of data that I need to sift
through)


Desired skills: Designing skills
