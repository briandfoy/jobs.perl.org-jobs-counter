Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
We MAY require a contractor to build a simple web application for our
corporate intranet. The platform is Linux/Apache, and we need a Perl CGI
application to manage data in a database (independent, may be SQLite,
MySQL, PostresSQL) via a set of web forms.

This is a one-off project, though there may be more project work at a later
date.

The work can mostly be done off-site, but we would prefer some on-site
attendance to initiate the project and for deployment.

Payment would be for the completion of the project. At the moment we are in
an exploratory phase, the requirement does not formally exist yet. We wpuld
like the project completed sooner rather than later, but the delivery date
is negotiable.

Required skills:
Perl 5.6/5.8
Template Toolkit 2
DBI
Apache/CGI

Desired skills:
Linux (Red Hat)
xhtml

Database (MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL)
