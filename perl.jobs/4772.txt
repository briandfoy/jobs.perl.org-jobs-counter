Job title:
Perl programmer for leading financial institution

Company name: Grady Levkov & Co

Location: United States, New York, New York

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Grady Levkov & Company, is a boutique recruiting firm that specializes in
technical and analytical searches.

A top tier Investment Bank here in Manhattan is looking for excellent Perl 
developers to work in one of their elite internal development groups. 

You would be part of a highly specialized team that is responsible for the
infrastructure within which other group members build their software.  The
mission of the team is to create, maintain, and operate tools and processes
for development.

Finance experience is not necessary.  The group is full of hard-core
technology enthusiasts.  If you are a proven Perl coder, with a hacker
mentality, a passion for technology and solid people skills, you’ll fit
right in.

Ideally, you’ve got experience in build or release engineering, with a
strong background in Unix and/or Windows scripting and programming. 
Essentially, you’d be programming all sorts of tools, from long-lived and
one-offs.  Large projects and small projects on Windows and Unix, in Java,
C++, Perl, shell, sql, though Perl is by and large the main programming
language used.	Knowledge of Python and databases is a plus.

Additional knowledge of unix machines, internals and hardware, windows
drivers and networking is also helpful.

You would be expected to change gears quickly and often, in this
high-pressure environment.  You would be working with very nice, super
smart ‘nerds’ that are hackers at heart and who share your enthusiasm,
interest and skill.

If you fit this profile, we'd be interested in discussing further. Please
respond through the link below (our web site) and we'll respond quickly if
we feel there's a match:

Required skills:
Perl, Java, C++, shell, sql, Python.  Unix and Windows.
