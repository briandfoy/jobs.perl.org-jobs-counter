Job title: Web Software Engineer

Company name: Pearson Education

Internal ID: CTG-161

Location: United States, MA, Boston

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Educating 100 million people worldwide, Pearson Education is the global
leader in integrated education publishing. With such renowned brands as
Prentice Hall, Scott Foresman, Addison Wesley, Allyn & Bacon, NCS Pearson,
and many others, Pearson Education provides quality content, assessment
tools, and educational services in all available media to a worldwide
marketplace, spanning the learning curve from birth through college and
beyond. Internationally we operate in 55 countries and 27 languages and
have more global publishing than any other competitor.

Pearson Education is an Equal Opportunity Employer EOE/M/F/V/D.

Technology is transforming the way we educate students. Pearson understands
this fact, and it is committed to playing a leadership role in the
transformation. 

The software development group you would be joining, referred to internally
at Pearson as the Mastering team, is responsible for an online homework /
tutoring system for college science students. The specific products are
called: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry, MasteringAstronomy, and
MasteringBiology. We are extremely proud of these products they are based
on educational research done at M.I.T. and they have proven very effective.


The Mastering product line is built on top of standard web technology:
Perl, Flash, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, MySQL, and Apache. It is a
high-throughput database application that services hundreds of thousands of
students.

We are currently looking for smart, experienced web developers who know
Perl and are generalists who are happiest when the entire codebase is their
playground. That is, we are not looking for specialists at this time.

The office is on Arlington Street at the corner of the Boston Public
Garden. The environment is professional, but relaxed and flexible. The
emphasis is on getting good work done effectively rather than on adhering
to someones idea of perfect process. It is a small development team. You
can have a major impact on the team dynamics and the products evolution.

Note that while our server-side codebase is essentially all Perl, we do not
require you to know Perl before you get here. If you have a deep
understanding of database driven web application architecture and consider
yourself to be a serious software engineer, then we would be happy to have
you join our team and learn Perl.


Required skills:
Perl (or equivalent) expertise
Software Engineering Background
Smart, Dedicated, Team Player
Comfortable working on a large (but organized) software project
Experience with multi-tier, high-throughput web applications
Database programming experience, working knowledge of SQL

Desired skills:
Science, Engineering, and/or Math background is a plus
Educational / Teaching background is a plus
Experience with mod-perl is a plus
Experience with the general Open Source toolset is a plus
