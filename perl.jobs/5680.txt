Pay rate: $35/hr+, depends on experience

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Description:

Double Prime, Inc. has built and maintains approximately 80 global
e-commerce and marketing websites for major Fortune 500 companies.  The
application layer is apache/mod_perl, with an oracle back end managed by
another group.	We have datacenters in the US, Korea, and China, e-commerce
sites in the US, UK, France, and Australia, and are rapidly expanding into
other markets.

Our sites syndicate into various retailers such as Macys, Sephora, and
Kohls, so that customers may buy products via those channels.  Through a
novel technology we retain full control over the design and product
assortment on those sites.

We have a team of 12 full-time engineers, responsible for application
development, network infrastructure, security, reporting, and other aspects
of the business.

We are looking for 4-6 full-time engineers to join our team.  Initially the
positions will be contractual and of indefinite duration.  Roles will
include:

- day-to-day interaction with the our group, client management, and design
firms, maintaining and developing websites

- new application development

- systems and network administration (solaris, linux, cisco)


Required skills:

Most importantly, a thorough knowledge of OO perl is required.	Beyond
that, since we are looking for people to fulfill multiple roles, specifics
are listed under "desired skills".


Desired skills:

*You need not fit all required skills in order to secure a position with
our company - just one or more of them.*

- development and support of existing applications built in mod_perl
- experience with client-side database operations via the perl DBI
- technical management and related tools (e.g. bugzilla, RT, wiki)
- knowledge of front end technologies (e.g. html, css, javascript, ajax,
flash)
- systems administration functions such as unix account and groups, shell
scripting, patching
- network infrastructure, e.g. cisco switches and firewalls, IPS, VPN
- multiple language support in perl (also the ability to speak multiple
languages including German, French, Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin and
Cantonese), Korean, and others)
