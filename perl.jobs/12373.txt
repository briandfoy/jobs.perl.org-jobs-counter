Job title: perl/java programmer

Company name: DataSource Corp.

Location: Boulder, CO, USA

Pay rate: $20/hr.

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Our company was established 24 years ago, specializing in the collection
and sale of data published by local governments. In the interest of
maximizing the efficiency of data entry we undertook a software development
project to automate large portions of the data collection process. The
approach has been so effective we are now in desperate need of an
additional programmer for our team.

The current project requires the development and maintenance of thousands
of programs, one for each website with the data we seek. The challenge is
not in the complexity of the individual programs but in the analysis needed
to write them. Because of the uniqueness of our requirements, our need is
not for someone with advanced programming skills but rather a willingness
to problem solve and acquire skills as necessary. You will also be expected
to grow beyond the initial role, developing more elegant solutions and
working on new projects as they arise.

Because this is a long term development project, we are only interested in
candidates willing to be long term, full time employees. We are investing
the time to teach you the advanced skills unique to our project and we want
you to stick around and use them. While you will be expected to have
reasonable availability for phone calls with various members of our team,
developers work remotely which allows for a fair amount of flexibility in
your schedule.

We are currently developing in Perl and you must be proficient with the
basic language features. Extensive knowledge of CPAN modules is nice but we
use very few and so this is not necessary. We may be switching languages
for a large portion of the project and knowledge of Java (particularly
experience with deploying to a Java application server) is desirable though
not strictly necessary. And while we would never require you to develop in
Perl on a Windows machine, at the moment our production environment is
Windows 7 with MS Access. Not having access to a machine with that set up
may exclude you from consideration.

Of particular interest are candidates with experience writing client side
web applications. Especially if you have dealt with the complexities of
HTTP requests and managed to work around executing javascript for site
navigation.

In order to be considered for the position, you will need to submit a code
sample so in addition to the normal interview process, be prepared to
commit about an hour to our programming test. Though we hope it takes you
half that time.

Required skills: PERL, Java, Windows, MS Access/SQL
