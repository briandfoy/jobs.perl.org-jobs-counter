technology, but MySQL and Postgres are being explored as alternatives.

Solid background in another language, be it .NET, Java, Python, PHP, or
Ruby on Rails, is a plus. Familiarity with a variety of open-source
technologies is a plus. 

A successful candidate will be enthusiastic and open to acquiring new
skills.

The candidate will be working on a variety of projects, including:

    * Maintaining and extending existing Perl-based CGI applications
    * Creating new applications in Perl, Catalyst, and potentially Ruby on
Rails
    * Contributing standardized modules and tools to our code library
    * Helping develop a solid release/deployment management framework 

Join us to participate in our continuous growth and develop the next
generation of centralized application and accreditation services.
