Reason for hire;
The NGD Forecasting project relies on a solid and comprehensive integration
of GD and NGD raw data and metadata components. The required data is
captured on and off the grid. The off-grid data needs to be copied to
specific grid locations on a daily/hourly basis, and the following aspects
need to be considered:
1. Daily analysis and statistics gathering of data volumes, annotations
2. Alert mechanism
3. Automated BCP support in case of failures
4. Full integration into the new grid ops method of data archiving,
retention, removal.

This person will specifically focus on enhancing existing processes to
cover full grid ops integration.
