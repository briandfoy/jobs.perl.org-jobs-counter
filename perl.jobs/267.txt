I am a contract Perl web programmer located in Hoboken, New Jersey and
have done work for many web design companies and ad

I am seeking a full or telecommuting position.  I specialize in
CGI/Perl/PHP programming on both unix/linux and have worked
on quite a few web projects including:
 
- Database Programming (MySQL)
- complex search engines
- banner ad rotation systems
- web form handlers with email
- auto-responders and verification
- self-maintained mailing lists
- web based surveys, polls and quizzes
- web page manipulation
- order forms
- specialized calculators
- modify existing programs
- installation of a new or existing program

I have 2 years of Perl/PHP experience. I charge $35/hour for any project.
Fixed rate price also available.
