Description:
IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) is looking for talented Software

We're looking for someone who loves working with the complex interactions
of large systems -- who enjoys optimising architecture for performance and
scalability and capably grapples with competing priorities and demands.
Candidates must be experienced, creative, flexible and self-motivated, with
a natural flair for designing and writing reliable, maintainable code.

This is a telecommuting position joining our extensive team in the Bristol
area, all of whom work from home. The successful candidate will need to
relocate to the Bristol area to be able to attend a weekly working lunch
and other meetings with colleagues.  You would be provided with the
necessary equipment and a fast broadband connection.

is currently the #17 most popular site in the U.S. and #31 world-wide

company with excellent prospects. Our salaries are extremely competitive,
and we also offer a top-notch benefits package courtesy of our parent
company, Amazon.co.uk.

Skills required:

architectures and large database-driven applications.
    * Candidates should have an extremely high level of competence in Perl,
Java, C++ or similar, be experienced in Object Oriented Design/OOP and be
comfortable working and programming in a UNIX/Linux environment. For
candidates without intimate Perl experience, we will be looking for
evidence of adaptability and experience in a related language (e.g.
shell-scripting, PHP, sed, awk).
  * Solid communication skills and the ability to work well in a team are
critical.
  * We'll be looking for evidence of excellent API design and architecture
skills.
  * A computer science degree or equivalent is required, along with
industry programming experience.

competencies like distributed systems, machine intelligence, data mining,
expert systems, natural language processing etc.
