Job title: Junior Software Engineer

Company name: Harvard Law School

Internal ID: 33969

Location: MA, Cambridge

Description:
The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School seeks a
Junior Software Engineer to assist with its research into media. The Media
Cloud project is building a system to collect and categorize content from a
wide variety of traditional and new media sources online to support a range
of research projects about the collected content. (See below for more
project details.) We need a smart, self-motivated software engineer who
will thrive in a dynamic, creative and fast-paced organization filled with
a wide variety of extremely bright people who are passionate about Internet
& society issues. Works with a distributed and often virtual team of
researchers, including faculty, fellows, students, and other engineers. As
with all appointments at the Berkman Center, this position is through until
June 30, 2009, with the possibility of continuation depending on funding
and business need. 

The content will be collected by an rss crawler backed by a large database
of feeds and media sources, a parser to convert the first page of html of
each story into the full text content of each story, and a terming engine
to generate a list of relevant terms for each parsed story. The database of
these stories and terms will be used as the basis for a number of research
projects into new media, including analysis of global attention profiles,
selective news amplification, and media meme propagation, many of which
will require additional work extracting and analyzing the necessary data
from the database. The junior engineer will be responsible for the great
bulk of the development of all of these pieces under the guidance of a
project leader and with the advice of a lead architect. About the
Organization: The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law
School is committed to producing scholarship with impact, and is proud to
be celebrating its tenth year as a research program founded to explore
cyberspace, share in its study, and help pioneer its development. Founded
in 1997, the Center now is home to an ever-growing community of faculty,
fellows, staff, and affiliates working on projects that span the
intersections among innovation, democracy, learning, law, technology, and
policy. The environment at Berkman offers both an opportunity to learn new
technologies and a unique window into the world of technology and policy. 

Required skills:
Basic qualifications: BSCS or equivalent experience with hands-on software
engineering experience required. Additional qualifications: demonstrated
ability to solve engineering problems and to plan, write, test, and deliver
modules of code with little direct supervision. Must have the ability to
research and learn new technologies quickly and often. Knowledge of the
following areas is helpful: perl, regular expressions, rss/atom, sql, web
crawling and scraping, browser automation, and mvc web development
(catalyst, dbix::class, and html::formfu are most helpful). Candidates with
a background and interest in new media specifically and Internet & society
issues in general are preferred. Cover letters should include a description
of a single (solved) engineering problem that best demonstrates each of
these aspects of development (plan, write, test, deliver).
