Job title:
Entry to mid-level web application developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C25

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys, reports and related
applications for a variety of clients in the market research industry. We
offer both software licensing via an SaaS model for our do-it-yourself
clients, and we program surveys and applications using our own software on
a project-by-project basis for clients who would rather outsource.

We're looking for a bright, enthusiastic junior to mid-level developer to
join our technical team at our office in Ladera Ranch, CA.

Local candidates only please -- must be within daily commuting distance of
Ladera Ranch, CA 92694.

Required skills:
Our core software is built using the following tools:

    * Object Oriented Perl
    * Apache/mod_perl
    * Postgres
    * JavaScript using AJAX and the ExtJS and YUI toolkits

The ideal candidate will be familiar with these tools. Our servers run
RedHat and/or CentOS Linux, so familiarity with these and/or the linux
command line in general is helpful as well.

Desired skills:
More important than any particular technical knowledge is a good foundation
in overall programming, the ability to learn and apply new skills quickly,
and effective communication and teamwork abilities. We need people that are
adept at sorting through a large codebase to quickly find bugs or identify
points of entry for new features. The position will involve significant
design work and new features evolve quickly, so we need someone who can
take the initiative to figure out what needs to be done, and then make it
happen.

Depending on your background and experience, you may also be responsible
for helping to monitor and manage our servers, and for providing technical
support to our clients. Finally, because we are a relatively small company,
everyone may be asked to wear different hats and help with whatever other
tasks are necessary to help the company grow and prosper.
