Seasoned perl + MySQL developer for growing, successful eCommerce business

Company name: GEMM.com

Internal ID: gemm_dev1b

Location: United States, CA, Palm Springs

Pay rate: $30

Description:

GEMM.com is seeking a seasoned systems engineer with extensive experience
in the development and maintenance of eCommerce systems based in Perl +
MySQL + Linux to join our small permanent team on a full-time basis.

Experience with RedHat system administration, Sybase, web page design,
Apache, sendmail, are a plus.


---------------------------
BACKGROUND:

GEMM.com is currently the world's largest open marketplace for hard-to-find
music. GEMM has experienced strong, consistent growth for the past six
years and  has healthy financials and plenty of opportunity for continued
growth.

So far, most of GEMM's technical development and maintenance have been
performed solely by co-founder Jim Hall. We now wish to add an additional
systems engineer to work with Jim to expand, refine, and strengthen our
systems and take over maintenance responsibilities.  

The position offers opportunity for everything from innovation of novel
functionality in our unique industry-leading marketplace system to ensuring
that existing systems run optimally.

In the long term, it's possible that the role of "CTO" and some equity in
the company could ultimately be assigned to you.


----------------------------
LOCATION / TELECOMMUTE

Our company is based in Palm Springs, but technical staff currently works
from their homes in New England. Our only requirement this time is that you
be able to travel and spend a few days every month or two in Palm Springs. 


As our business continues to expand, we anticipate a greater need for
on-site presence, so we prefer that you live in the Southern California
area or are open to the possibility of moving there in the future. This is
not currently a requirement however. 

We will only be considering candidates who live in the U.S. or Canada.


----------------------------
YOUR RESPONSE

Please point us to one or more internet sites for which you were the
primary developer and provide a sample of your code, preferably Perl that
interacts with mySQL.
