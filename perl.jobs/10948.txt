Job title: Experienced Systems Administrator

Company name: We Also Walk Dogs

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Description:
We need an experienced Linux systems administrator to help our clients --
progressive groups like MoveOn.org, Democracy for America and
BoldProgressives.org -- change the face of politics.

You will be responsible for deploying new applications and machines,
building tools to improve the performance of our deployments, and
responding to (and eliminating!) on-call alerts. We manage our own and our
clients' growing infrastructure of 30 physical servers and 50-60 virtual
machines.

This is a full-time contract position.

About We Also Walk Dogs

We Also Walk Dogs is a small, close-knit team. We develop cutting-edge
tools that power some of the biggest social change groups around; we're
both a laboratory and an engine.

Your co-workers are some of the best and brightest in the business. We Also
Walk Dogs engineers have written books, built cutting-edge election tools
and authored popular open source Perl and Python modules.

We have a virtual office. You can live wherever you want and you'll be in
touch with your colleagues by IM, email, and phone.

Required skills:
You must have experience managing production server clusters. You should
also be familiar with most or all of these technologies: CentOS/RHEL, Perl,
Python, Django, Subversion, MySQL, memcached, monitoring systems like
Nagios or Ganglia, configuration management tools like Chef, and
virtualization layers like Xen. You also need to know network configuration
and equipment: firewalls, routers, load balancers, and the like.

You must be a self-starter, capable of taking a project from start to
finish without constant direct supervision.

You need to be able to communicate clearly with your colleagues and clients
via email, IM and phone.
