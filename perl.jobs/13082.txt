Description:
We use Perl, Apache, mod_perl, MySQL, Memcache, JavaScript, Git, Linux &
more. We do Agile software development based on SCRUM. We get our changes
out really fast; it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems
within hours of you pushing it. As a data driven company we have a clear
goal – helping our customers.  Everything we do is aimed at solving
problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not
interested in doing it.

At Booking.com we believe that a good developer is a good developer no
matter what technology is involved – so even if the target technology is
Perl, we do not require Perl experience to apply – only a capacity and
willingness to learn it, superior craftsmanship and business orientation.

As a Software Developer, you are responsible for the development and
maintenance of our web based systems. In the position you will be required
to work both independently and also be part of a team. You are an excellent
communicator and have a can-do attitude.

Due to our continuing growth we are in search of 25 Perl Developers for our
headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We are open to receiving CV’s
from worldwide Software Developer candidates who have experience with Perl
and if you don’t know Perl we will provide you on the job training to learn
how to code in Perl. Are you ready to join an international, result driven,
fun and dynamic work environment?

Key Responsibilities:

   - You design and develop with colleagues new generation, secure,
scalable and high performance web based systems
   - Lead projects; coach and train new developers
   - Collaborate with Team Leaders to schedule your technical priorities
   - Answer questions regarding our current systems
   - Solve problems and issues
   - Act as an intermediary for complaints and problems 

Requirements:

   - Pragmatic, independent and pro-active work attitude
   - Excellent communication skills
   - Wide demonstrable experience with Object Oriented Programming
   - Experience with relational databases (preferably MySQL)
   - Experience with Linux and Server Side Technologies/HTTP
   - Minimum 4 years of experience with software development preferably in
1 or more of the following languages: PHP, Java, Python, C/C++ and/or Ruby
   - Preferably University level in Math or IT
   - Currently living in the Netherlands or prepared to relocate to the
Netherlands 

Interested?
We offer a competitive salary plus bonus, with possibilities for further
career opportunities within our fast growing company. This position is open
to worldwide candidates and in the case of relocation we will assist you
with a relocation package ensuring a smooth transition to working and
living in the Netherlands.
