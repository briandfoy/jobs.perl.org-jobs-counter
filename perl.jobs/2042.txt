Description:

Other duties will involve self-organization, task management, time line
assessment, product release and implementation.

documentation of your products and comment your code well.


Desired skills:
 XML::RPC/SOAP/WSDL
 Debian/Apt (package management and package building a plus)

 More advance Linux experience
 PHP
 MySQL
 Bash/sh
 Vim or Emacs	(we don't use IDE's, but we are not opposed to it as long
as it's free and/or open-source)
