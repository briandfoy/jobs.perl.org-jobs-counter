Job title: senior software engineer (UNIX/Perl)

Company name: Aruba Networks

Location: Sunnyvale, CA

Pay rate: based on qualifications & experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Consider your wireless network at home. You probably have a single access
point/router, and only a few people with a handful of devices connected to
the network.

How would you scale that up to a larger building, multiple buildings on a
large campus, or multiple geographic sites? How would you design software
to configure, upgrade, and monitor the usage and security of that network
in real-time?

If this sounds like an interesting challenge, then a career in the AirWave
division at Aruba Networks may be waiting for you!

Aruba Networks is a leader in providing enterprise-scale WLAN/edge
networking products. Our customers include major universities, giant tech
companies, and international retail stores, with deployments numbering
thousands of access points and tens of thousands of wireless devices.

AirWave is Aruba's software solution for managing and monitoring the health
and usage of massive WiFi deployments.

We practice Agile/extreme programming with short release cycles in a fun,
relaxed atmosphere that feels very much like working for a startup --
except without the long hours, and with all the benefits of being part of a
larger company (401k, ESPP, open vacation).

But enough about us, what about you?

You must have a solid grasp of computer science/software engineering
concepts, including common data structures and algorithms and
object-oriented design. You must also be familiar with at least one flavor
of Linux (preferably CentOS/RHEL) and be completely at home on the UNIX
command line.

Nice-to-haves: the more of these you can check off, the better (we are
looking for both front end and back end engineers, so it's ok if you lean
one way or the other):

- scripting languages (particularly perl)
- detailed knowledge of common networking protocols (including SNMP and
HTTP)
- version control systems (preferably svn)
- SQL databases (preferably Postgres)
- multi-server high availability/failover architecture
- web stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, Apache)
- web frameworks (especially Google Closure)
- system administration/configuration of anything mentioned above

This is a full-time position in Sunnyvale, CA.
