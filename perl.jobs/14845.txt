Job title: Web Application Developer

Company name: DEVNET, Inc.

Location: Sycamore, IL, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
DEVNET, Inc. is looking for a developer with experience in full-stack web
applications.  You'll be customizing our core web application for new
customers, chasing down and fixing bugs for existing clients.  You'll
complain about and then work around the limitations of missing or bad
client data, aid in the design of new applications, then be charged with
implementing them.

The ideal candidate will possess excellent analytical and design skills,
good user interface design skills, and be able to produce quality,
well-documented, and well-tested code. Applicants must be energetic,
motivated, self-starting individuals that don’t require micro-management to
be productive. While our developers are rock stars, we have no room for
lone gunmen – candidates must be able to work productively with a team of
developers. The ability to prioritize, multi-task, and (on occasion)
completely change what you're doing at the drop of a hat is vital.

DEVNET, Inc. is an established, privately held company, headquartered in
Sycamore, IL. For almost 20 years, we have been providing local government
with cutting edge, innovative solutions for property tax and property
appraisal.

We’re not hung up on degrees or titles – we’re interested in finding the
right fit for our team. Hobbyists with elite skills, doctoral candidates,
and experienced engineers all get an equal shake here. Sense of humor is a
must!

DEVNET offers a casual working environment and competitive compensation
package, including medical, dental, vacation, personal and sick time off.
We have families too, and offer a family friendly environment.	While we
strongly prefer our employees to work in-house, telecommuting is an option
for the right candidate.  Relocation compensation is available.  

You must be legally able to work in the United States to apply for this
position - sponsorship is not available. Individual applicants only. No
agencies please. 

Things We Use Daily:
- Modern Perl (DBIx::Class, Moose, Dancer)
- Linux
- nginx
- SQL Server
- Git
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

Required skills:
- Modern Perl programming experience (or other dynamic languages such as
Ruby or Python)
- Understanding of general web application security concerns including
Cross Site Scripting and SQL injection
- Experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- SQL experience (any flavor, but MS SQL experience a plus)
- Familiarity with a version control system (git preferred, Subversion and
Mercurial suffice too)

Desired skills:
You'll get extra credit for:
- Bootstrap/responsive design experience
- jQuery and jQuery-UI development experience
- Web site accessibility (ADA compliance)
- Automated testing experience
- Web services
- MongoDB or other NoSQL database, and the wisdom as to when to use a NoSQL
database
- iOS development experience
- Elite Aerobie skills
