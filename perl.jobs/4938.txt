Job title: Network Operations Database

Company name: LiveOps

Location: California, Palo Alto

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
LiveOps is searching for a seasoned DBA  and Perl Programmer to participate
in the development and provide ongoing technical support for our LiveOps
database infrastructure. This is a seed position that could develop into
more responsibility as our business grows. Candidates for this position
must be able to work responsibly, independently, and with a high degree of
professionalism as they are responsible for a revenue generating web based
service.

The DBA is responsible for managing the LiveOps database infrastructure and
associated application set at a Tier 2 level. This will involve applying
your talents, skills, and experience to maintain uptime and improve the
reliability of databases, applications using databases, and the associated
servers for the entire LiveOps business. You’ll get to use your strong
technical expertise to dive into the more difficult issues and work with
Product, QA, and NOC teams to improve our products while easing
supportability and improving quality of the service. Get ready to forge
relationships, make an impact, and join a team currently leading the world
in providing advanced teleservices. 

We offer an excellent benefits package that includes: medical, dental,
vision, short/long term disability insurance, flexible spending accounts,
401(k), paid time off and stock options. Employees enjoy a casual dress
code and a fun, progressive environment! LiveOps is an equal opportunity
employer.

ABOUT LIVEOPS:

LiveOps is revolutionizing the domestic outsourced teleservices market by
making exclusive use of home-based operators (agents). Our LiveOps agents
run their own, individual home-based businesses using a PC, Internet
connection and telephone to take calls in their homes in accordance with
their own, self-defined schedules. Our home-based model attracts an
abundance of highly qualified agents from across the country, and our
proprietary technology platform enables them to provide immediate, superior
service to our customers. 

We are currently engaged in exciting new opportunities that leverage both
our home-based agent model and our proprietary, IP teleservices technology
to provide compelling solutions for both businesses and other call center
operators. By making use of our technology and expertise in home-based
teleservices, businesses and traditional call centers can dramatically
reduce costs – abandoning expensive facilities and re-deploying agents from
their homes – thereby enabling cost structures to be competitive with
off-shore facilities, while quality levels remain that of domestic service
providers.

This “next generation” call center model leverages the power of IP
telephony to redefine the economics of an industry that is long overdue –
and hungry – for revolutionary innovation. Our high-caliber, home-based,
PROFITABLE outsourced call center – coupled with the arrival to market of
our revolutionary technology platform – puts LiveOps in a unique position
to dominate this rapidly emerging sector of the $200B call center industry.


We are financially and strategically backed by Menlo Ventures and CMEA. We
are profitable, progressive, and on a sound growth path to becoming a major
player in the VOIP call center space.


Required skills:
 Minimum of 5-7 years of experience as a Database Administrator for a large
scale web based application suite.
 At least 5 years experience with PERL programming
• Deep experience with designing, deploying, and administering LAMP
• Deep experience in world class SOC/NOC process
