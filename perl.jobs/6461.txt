One Access mdb file, located on network share (samba share) and not
more then 30 teachers accessing it in the same time via shortcut (UNC
path).
It is 63 tables, almost half of it ODBC linked to MySQL 4.0.27
(FreeBSD). Size is not more then 50K records but some of tables have
more then 200 columns called for e.g. F2GcS5 which may make it
difficult to work out which data is redundant.

What we really need is type of CRUD, possible Maypole based, with
new database schema , some abstraction layer (Class::DBI) and about 40
forms based on templates. Good documentation, and well performed swap to
new system.

but we are open to discuss it.

Required skills:
OO Perl, CGI.pm, Class::DBI, TT, Apache2, MySQL, PDF reports
