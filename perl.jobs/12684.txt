Job title: Sr. Software Engineer - DevOps

Company name: bepress

Internal ID: bepressSE2012

Location: Berkeley, CA, USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Refactoring legacy code.  Paying off technical debt.  Still reading?  

If so we need an engineer like you.   We need someone who is strong in Perl
and wants to work in a small environment making big changes.  Our older
products are in need of some TLC so that we can continue to support our
growth.  We also need more heads and hands developing new products.  As a
member of our DevOps team you’ll have an impact on our systems end-to-end.

Bepress is a SaaS provider offering services to the academic community to
showcase and share their work.	Our Digital Commons product is the leading
hosted Institutional Repository and our growth has been exponential.   We
have a feel-good mission helping to promote the open access movement
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) that is changing the world of
scholarly exchange.

We offer:
• Friendly, collaborative environment
• Bicycle friendly downtown Berkley location
• Challenging yet realistic goals
• Really smart co-workers (no, really!)
• Money
• Matching IRA plan
• Medical and dental plans

You must be authorized to work in the US without sponsorship.

Required skills:
• Great with Perl.
• Really good with some other things. Python would be great but Ruby, Java
or C counts too.
• Postgres, or at least some SQL DB.
• Real application development for high traffic web applications.
• Experience with the LAMP stack.
• Significant re-engineering/re-architecting projects.
• JavaScript.
• Experience with object oriented programming, MVC and multi-tiered
architectures.
• Understanding of deployment issues in a multi-tiered/multi-tenant hosted
environment.
• Strong communication skills.	Seriously!
• Willingness to join the on-call rotation.
• Ability to laugh, especially at yourself.
