Job title: Linux / Apache / MySQL / Perl (LAMP) Developer

Company name: WireSpring Technologies

Internal ID: 2011Q302

Location: USA, FL, Ft Lauderdale

Pay rate: USD $50-60K

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
WireSpring has an immediate opening for an awesome Linux/Apache/MySQL/Perl
(LAMP) developer. The selected candidate will work with our software
development and QA teams to build cutting-edge, web-based applications for
digital signage and remote device management. The ideal candidate will be
comfortable working in an all-Linux environment, and will use a back-end
LAMP stack to drive rich web applications written in HTML 4/5, CSS and
JavaScript. All applicants should be neat, well-organized and
detail-oriented.

The salary range for this position is $50-60k, depending on experience.
This is a full-time position. The work location is Fort Lauderdale, FL.
Partial telecommuting may be available after completing the initial 3-6
months of training at our Fort Lauderdale headquarters.

Required skills:
Candidates should have 5 years of experience with:

- Working in a Linux environment - your desktop workstation will run the
Linux variant of your choosing, so you must know how to use it!

- Writing object-oriented Perl. We LOVE Perl here, but if you're confident
that your Ruby/Python/PHP skills would translate over to our environment,
we're willing to listen.

- Writing dynamic web applications using dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
by hand.

- Writing and modifying database queries using MySQL

The following are also pretty important:

- Strong written and verbal communication skills
- 2 or 4-year college degree
- Sense of humor. (Yes, it's required.)

Desired skills:
- Experience working with mod_perl
- Experience with event-loop programming architectures like POE or AnyEvent

- Familiarity with common JavaScript frameworks, in particular the
Prototype library
- Experience with the HTML5 File and Blob classes (and other HTML5
experience in general)
