Job title:
DNA and Dancer Down Under =E2=80=93 mid-level developer required for a
bioinformatics company in Canberra

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: Canberra, Australia

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Back in 1953 when Watson and Crick first discovered DNA, they burst into
the pub near their laboratory boasting that they had =E2=80=98discovered th=
e secret
of life=E2=80=99. More than half a century later, scientists are still unra=
velling
the many mysteries encoded within the DNA of organisms, and our client is
working at the cutting edge in this field. Their software provides
genotyping information about crops and can assist in the development of new
species.

Perks include a generous annual bonus, flexible working hours,
and the opportunity to work from home for a significant proportion of time
after the initial 6 months onsite in Canberra to get you up to speed.
Candidates must have an existing right to work in Australia, as the company
cannot provide visa sponsorship.

Desired skills:
Sitting right at the junction of technology and life sciences, this is a
unique role. The company=E2=80=99s priority is to hire a candidate with exc=
ellent
modern Perl skills, so they are happy to consider strong developers coming
from other industries who show a genuine interest in moving into the
bioinformatics field. Perhaps you studied genetics or have worked in
scientific analysis before, but then your career took another direction for
a few years? Or perhaps you have a strong personal interest in the field
and reading up about the latest genome technology breakthroughs in Nature
magazine forms part of your weekend routine? If so, the company are keen to
speak to you, and a comprehensive in-house induction programme will help
get you up to speed with the latest bioinformatics developments.=20

Their
technological environment consists of some legacy code, which is now being
modernised, and some newer code based on the Dancer framework. The right
candidate will be familiar with modern tooling and might have some exposure
to Ansible and AWS and Linux containers. Familiarity with MySQL and
Postgres as well as Solr would all be advantages. As a small team they
promote the autonomy of developers.
