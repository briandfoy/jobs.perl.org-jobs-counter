Job title: SDE-UI, Personalization

Company name: Amazon.com

Internal ID: 04-10228

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
When was the last time you walked into a store where the clerk greeted you
at the door with an item selected just for you? In the world of online
commerce we can accomplish the seemingly impossible - building a store for
every customer, picking perfect items from a universe of millions, all in
the blink of an eye, thousands of times each second. Work with the best
personalization technology on the planet - work at Amazon.com: Work with
brilliant peers; Conceive of creative new ways to connect people with
things they didn't even know they wanted; Design front end focused
mechanisms customers can use to make the website *their* website, and help
define the business direction of the team. Life isn't all code, after all.
We are looking for people who love to write code to solve UI problems, love
to see their solutions in use, and thrive in a small cross functional team.
Successful candidates love the Web, buy things online, explore new
technologies for fun, and build Web sites in their free time. We also
expect candidates who are good communicators, flexible, hard-working,
smart, and have at least five years of experience building complex
websites. Customer focus is essential. An interest in business, or
experience in system architecture would be nice pluses. Oh, and a degree in
computer science, math, or even something more esoteric.

Required skills:
If you are an expert in object-oriented techniques, if you have delivered
truly reliable and maintainable solutions, and if you have designed and
built complex websites using Java/JSP, JavaScript, Perl, Mason, C++, CSS,
HTML and other Web technologies, we want to talk to you.
