Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: blekko

Location: United States, CA, Redwood Shores

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
blekko is building a disruptive general-purpose web search engine. We are
hiring software engineers.

Web search is not only one of the most important technologies of our time,
but it is also incredibly fun to work on because it requires cutting-edge
algorithms from a wide range of disciplines. It is one of the hardest
startup challenges today – but the monetization is much higher than
anything else on the web, and there are fewer credible competitors than
most people think.

Our team has founded multiple successful startups and held leadership
positions at major tech companies such as Google, Sun and Netscape/AOL. We
have funding from top-tier venture investors and a roster of highly
prominent Silicon Valley angels including Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, and
two early Googlers.

Our crawl/index/search/query code is implemented on top of a distributed
storage system that supports integrated map job execution, data
replication, scalability, and fault tolerance. The programming model is
similar to Google BigTable, but the application-level code tends to be more
high-level and pleasant to work with than a typical high performance
distributed application.

We are looking for talented software engineers who enjoy working on big
systems, appreciate the productivity wins of interpreted languages and good
API design, want to work on advanced search applications at web scale, and
are:

    * Highly productive coders, self-motivated and able to learn new skills
quickly
    * Intellectually curious and more pragmatic than theoretic
    * Comfortable in a small-company, startup environment 


Required skills:
(In descending order of importance): UNIX/Linux, Perl, C/C++, Javascript,
HTML/CSS 

Desired skills:
Search, particularly web search

Large-scale distributed systems (e.g., Map/Reduce, Hadoop, distributed
filesystems, clustered databases)

Deep systems knowledge of operating systems, I/O, and networks

Applied math, statistics and/or machine learning, particularly as applied
to ranking and classification

Degree in computer science or related area, especially masters and PhD

Industry experience, especially in startups or domain-relevant Internet
companies

Interest in potential leadership opportunities as the company scales
