Location: United States, CA, Mission Viejo

Pay rate: $45,000 - $65,000 USD per year, DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys for a variety of
clients in the market research industry. We offer both software licensing
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we program surveys
using our own software on a project-by-project basis for clients who would
rather outsource all survey set up.

Our core software is built using mod_perl, Postgres, and Linux. We are
hiring a Perl programmer who can help us support our current clients as
well as improve on our core software.

The Perl Programmer will:

1) Provide technical support to clients by responding to support requests
through phone and email, and writing custom Perl code for client projects.

2) Support our core software by providing bug fixes and feature additions.

Required skills:
Good interpersonal skills and a professional manner with clients are
essential. Solid experience with Perl programming is important. However,
the ability to learn quickly and adapt to new roles is more important than
any particular technical skill.


Desired skills:
Other desired skills:
    - Linux system administration and networking experience
    - The ability to understand our business and suggest ways to leverage
our current technology.
    - The ability to work independently
