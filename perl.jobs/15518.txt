Job title: Perl Catalyst Developer

Company name: Connect Distribution

Location: Birmingham, UK

Pay rate: Competative

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
As a backfill for a recent promotion, we have an opportunity for a capable
developer to join our in-house team of open source developers.

We have
developed scores of eCommerce websites generating tens of millions of
pounds in income, and are currently in the process of re-developing the
data structure and publishing tools that these sites are based on, as well
as integrating them to a MS Dynamics AX ERP system and are about to
re-build the front ends to become responsive and device agnostic.

Whilst
ideally we are looking for someone with a Perl / Catalyst background,
really what we want is a good developer.  We have previously successfully
cross-trained developers with skills in languages such as PHP, Ruby,
Python, JavaScript, etc., and we’re prepared to invest in your training
too, so the successful candidate’s actual language experience is less
important that the fact that they can genuinely write good code.  

All the
sites are hosted in Linux, so exposure to this, or other Unix platforms,
would be useful, as would familiarity with version control systems such as
Subversion, Git, or Mercurial, etc

The company is a family run business
that has been trading for over 45 years.  It currently employs c.600 staff
and has an annual turnover of c.£100m.

Desired skills:
The core technology these sites are based on is Perl, using the catalyst
framework, although we are increasing using AngularJS, and other
technologies used include MySQL, Couchbase, RabbitMQ, Redis, Solr,
ElasticSearch, and Puppet, to name a few.
