DO NOT REPLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE 100% OF THE LISTED SKILLS.

I need a daemon written that can send ascii commands to and read answers
returned from a USB device.  It Should be very simple, I will send it
strings and then it will respond to those strings, it should be running all
the time (as daemons do) and should be semi portable.
the device is an "USB Insteon PowerLinc V2"
There is very little code out there for it now, I just need a quick and
dirty, but stable way to read/write to it.

Required skills:
Perl
Device::USB
Device::USB::Device
