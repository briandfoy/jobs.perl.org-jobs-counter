Description:
Plain Black (www.plainblack.com) is looking for a Perl programming, Linux
using, ssh connected, GEEK! We're not looking for your run of the mill
developer; only geeks should apply. We want you to know and love
technology. We want you to not only have heard of operating systems other
than Windows, but to have used them. And most importantly, we want you to
be hungry to learn more every single day. If this sounds like you, continue
reading, else go read some other job descriptions. 

On a day to day basis you'll be tasked with special development projects,
helping us develop new products to bring to market, or to enhance our
existing products.

At Plain Black Research and Development is part of the Support Department.
We feel that in order to be truly in touch with customer need, you have to
see where they're struggling. Therefore when you're not working on special
projects you'll be working on bug fixes, and small improvements requested
by our customers, to our core open source project, WebGUI. This is a great
opportunity to be directly involved in a commercial open source software
project.
