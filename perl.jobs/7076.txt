Job title:
Web Software Development Manager and Applications Programmer

Company name: Maxim Integrated Products

Internal ID: 0302

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Web Software Development Manager and Applications Programmer

Location: Sunnyvale, CA or Dallas, TX

We are looking for a Web Software Development Manager for  maxim-ic.com, a
Fortune-1000, business-to-business, corporate  website. You can have the
variety, creativity, and financial  opportunity usually found in a small
company with the resources of a  very profitable public company -- Maxim
Integrated Products. Position  can be located in Sunnyvale (near San Jose,
California) or Dallas, TX.

The website is highly strategic to the company and has very high 
visibility and top management support.

You will report to the Executive Director of Internet Marketing. You  will
manage seven programmers in three locations. You will also do  hands-on web
applications design and development.

Our web developers are the very best. They are not just programmers:  They
think strategically and design their apps, including user  interface and
on-screen appearance and messages. They have excellent	communication
skills and work with all aspects of their apps. They  are responsible for
their own QA.

The programming team is responsible for all the technical aspects of 
running the website: system admin, hardware and co-location, database 
administration, and applications development, including user  interface.

Technology: New development is Linux, Apache, Mason, Perl, MySQL.  Moving
forward, we will be adding Ajax.

Design philosophy is streamlined and pragmatic. The site is built for 
electrical engineers, who want a fast, efficient website. While we  are
up-to-speed on new technologies, we don't implement bells and  whistles
without good reason.

Our programming is presently guerilla-style: We work quickly, usually 
without detailed specs or elaborate test and release procedures. User 
interfaces are not prototyped in great detail, and each engineer has  been
responsible for his own quality. We rely on the judgement and  experience
of our programmers, rather than spending time on specs and  procedures. As
the site grows, we know we will need more traditional  procedures and this
position will be responsible for managing this	growth and developing basic
quality assurance.

YOU WILL:

- Be responsible for day-to-day management of approximately 7  programmers,
located in Sunnyvale, CA; Dallas, TX; and Bangalore,  India.

- Manage a top-tier development team of committed, effective,  talented,
and creative programmers who make design and user interface  decisions on
their own, without finely-detailed specs and extensive	quality checks.

- Be very hands-on, with your own projects as well as supervisory 
responsibilities.

- Be responsible for making sure web applications are highly usable, 
attractive, professional, efficient, and conform to the look, feel,  and
function of our site.

Required skills:
- Three years experience managing programmers. Excellent recommendations.

- Very strong web applications experience.

- Four years experience with Object-Oriented Perl programming  (mod_perl
programming desireable, Mason is a strong plus).

- Four years experience with SQL programming for a relational  database
management system (MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, etc.).

- Four years experience with Linux or a Unix operating system.

- Ability to hand-code high-quality HTML, CSS, Dynamic HTML, and
Javascript.

- Excellent communication skills and written English.

- Demonstrated attention to quality and detail.

- Some travel (Dallas / Sunnyvale / Bangalore)

- Strong aesthetic sense: You can see what looks attractive and 
professional and conforms to the look and feel of a site.

- Must be able to show portfolio of web applications (of your own  and/or
managed) that are attractive, functional, efficient, and work well.

Desired skills:
- Desirable: AJAX Experience, internationalization (Unicode), mod_perl,
load Balancing, LAMP enthusiast.

- Desirable: Experience integrating systems with ERP (especially SAP).
