Company name: Brainbox Digital

Location: Wimbledon, London

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Brainbox Digital are looking for a passionate graduate/junior developer to
join their dedicated and talented development team.

This is a hands-on development role with one of the most exciting, engaging
and innovative online companies out there.

You will be trained and developed by senior developers in-house to achieve
your fullest potential in an exciting and thriving online industry.

You will be an ambitious, driven individual who thrives working on their
own but also as part of a team.

You will have a technical background and will be comfortable with writing
code, ideally in Perl.	However, we are looking to train the right
candidate in-house, so a background in another language is expected.

You'll primarily be learning and using Perl and MySQL running on a Linux
platform, but there'll also be the chance to dabble in other technologies
such as Twitter Bootstrap and AngularJS, Python, Ruby, etc. For us, it's
all about having the right tools for the job, so technology evolution is
assured.

You will be a self starter, and someone who is genuinely interested in
developing your skills with new and upcoming technology.

Required skills:
o Good understanding of Object Orientated Programming
o Good logical problem solving abilities
o Good communication skills
o Attention to detail
o Perl not required but beneficial

This is a full-time role based in London, please do not apply if you are
not eligible to work in the UK.

Desired skills: Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
