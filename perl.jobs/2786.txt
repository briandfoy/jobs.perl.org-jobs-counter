Job title:
Perl/CGI Programmer needed for e-commerce project

Company name: Bushido Designs

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I'm in desperate need of a Perl programmer to help me out with an
e-commerce project. Here's the quick and dirty details:

I have a client who has a bunch of affiliate sites. All carry the same
inventory and use the same gateway (goemerchant.com) but have different
URL's and gateway info.

I have set up a hosting account with two sub-domains, and have found a
simple CGI cart (commerce-cgi.com) that says it works with goemerchant's
gateway. I have managed to get the cart installed and working, but it's not
passing the payment info to the gateway.

I need someone who can get the cart passing the info to the gateway and
back.


Required skills: Perl/CGI, Basic HTML

Desired skills:
Experience with commerce-cgi.com, experience with goemerchant's gateway
