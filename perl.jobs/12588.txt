Job title: Web Scraping Expert - Perl

Company name: Wunderdog Sports LLC

Location: Colorado

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
Looking for a Perl developer with basic understanding of XML, SQL, and the
DOM. You should consider yourself experienced in web scraping.

* One to three years production experience with Perl
* At least one "serious" project around XML.  Plus points for XML::LibXML
and friends.
* At least one "serious" project around SQL - We happen to use MySQL, but a
background in any SQL variant would be acceptable.
* Close familiarity with DOM.

You will need to hit the ground running making changes to numerous programs
that are built around the following modules, for which demonstrable
experience is indispensable:
   Moose
   XML::LibXML::*
   WWW::Mechanize
   HTML::TreeBuilder
   XML::Simple
   Web::Scraper
   Class::DBI (or any ORM, e.g. Rose::DB, DBIx::Class)
   DateTime (and using its formatters)
   Date::Manip
   SQL::Abstract

When replying to this job posting please provide a resume, hourly rate and
your current location. At least 6 of your working hours MUST be between
17:00 and 00:00 UTC. If you do not send a resume, hourly rate and current
location, you will immediately be removed from consideration. If you meet
the desired modules requirements, experience and working hours, you will be
contacted and asked to give at least three references. In addition, we will
ask you to complete a simple Perl programming task that will take between
1-2 hours to complete without compensation.

Required skills:
Moose
   XML::LibXML::*
   WWW::Mechanize
   HTML::TreeBuilder
   XML::Simple
   Web::Scraper
   Class::DBI (or any ORM, e.g. Rose::DB, DBIx::Class)
   DateTime (and using its formatters)
   Date::Manip
   SQL::Abstract
