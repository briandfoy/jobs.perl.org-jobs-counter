Job title:
Full Stack Developer / Sys Admin - The Register - London UK OR Remote

Company name: The Register

Location: London, United Kingdom

Pay rate:
GBP£ 30K - 50K Depending on experience and location

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Situation Publishing, owner of The Register, is looking for a full-stack
software developer/sysadmin to work on server side Perl code and
Debian-based servers.

You'll work in our London office, or from your own
home office anywhere in the world, doing a combination of software
development and on-going maintenance and tasks such as log reporting,
server monitoring, applying software updates and system tuning to ensure
the availability and quality of our online presence, as well as planning,
making design and architectural decisions, and a mix of new development and
improvement of backend and client-side code.

Required skills:

Excellent
English and communication skills
Legal right to work in the UK – if you
choose to work from our London office
Experience writing Perl, or excellent
skills in a similar language and be happy to bend them to working with Perl
Experience writing (valid) HTML, Javascript and CSS
Debian/Ubuntu
experience, and comfort with the shell
Good knowledge of Apache and NGINX
Experience working with both MySQL and Postgres
Comfort using software
revision control (e.g. Git)
Comfort using SQL (“raw” and through
abstractions like DBIx::Class)
Debian package management, and day-to-day
system administration

Desired skills:

Familiarity and experience with
server virtualisation (LXC, VirtualBox, etc)
Testing and monitoring
Mail
servers (e.g. Exim)
Cloud services (e.g. AWS, Scaleway, DO, etc)

Broadly
put, we favour open source: we use Debian/Ubuntu, Perl, Apache, NGINX,
Exim, Redis, MySQL & Postgres in our stack. We rely heavily on Git for
process and revision control. We sometimes write our own tools. Our
business is on the web and spans the entire world.

Our tech team is small,
focused and has a good degree of autonomy, so you need to be able to
produce great work and be comfortable communicating with the wider business
via email, phone, instant messaging and online tools such as Skype, Trello,
Wikis and Google Docs.

We are looking for a full-stack software
developer/sysadmin to help take off the tech team’s load of system
administration and general backend development, while also being
comfortable making client-side changes where required.

We offer a
competitive yearly contract rate based on your experience. If you choose to
work from our London office as an employee instead, we offer company
pension contribution and 25 days annual holiday.

To apply, please send
your CV to jobs@sitpub.com and include your salary/yearly contract rate
expectations plus a brief answer to any one of the following:

- Which
non-default deb package do you always like to install on a fresh system,
and why?
- What non-core CPAN module could you not live without, and why?
-
When configuring Apache, which non-core mod_* do you like to be installed,
and why?
