Perl Mongers,
Would anyone in the community be interested in consulting for a limited
scope project for a day or two.
The project is for a well known Corporation that would look great on any one
of our resumes.

The technical objectives are fairly straight forward:

	1) Connect to a fixed URI to pickup an authentication cookie.
	2) Assemble a second URI with fields derived from an Oracle table.
	3) Submit the second URI (using the cookie from step 1) to a static HTTP
server.
	4) Query the static HTTP session id (returned in step 3) for status
feedback of request.

	Misc. Details:
	- The environment is Solaris and Oracle Web Application Server (and maybe
Apache.)
	- The wrapping logic is not needed. Only need the specific routines for the
Connect, Assemble, Submit, and Query.

If you are interested in more information and are well versed in the LWP
module of perl, please reply right away.  This is an immediate need.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,

Keith Hansen.
