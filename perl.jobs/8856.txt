Job title: talented, young coder--text processing

Company name: none

Internal ID: none

Location: 02906, RI, Providence

Pay rate: ~$20-$40/hour, plus

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:

High-school and college students welcome.   High-end coding talents are
required, not a corporate resume.

The task is to transcode OCR'ed documents.  The project is scientific in
nature---the documents are academic research papers, and the end product
should be a web of papers referencing other papers.  It should be "fun." 
Some of it is tedious, though---making sure the code works on many
different inputs.

The project has specific self-contained steps that need to be accomplished.
 However, there is also always more work.  This project can last as short
as 3 months or as long as 3 or more years.

A big part of this may be an academic recommendation and entry into
academic scientific programming jobs in the social sciences---I am a
professor of economics and finance at a top-end academic institution. 
Also, this is more fun that working for a corporation...

Compensation is project based.	Salary is hard to describe per hour,
because it is project-based.  

If local to New England, I would also like to meet in Providence, because
it makes it easier to explain the task.


Required skills:

perl.  very basic SQL.

responsible and reliable:  if you say you can do it by day X, it must be
done by day X.


Desired skills:

maintainer of some open-source perl modules, and/or known contributor to an
open-source project.
