Description:
=head1 NAME

Senior::Software::Engineer - your new job.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     my $job = Senior::Software::Engineer->new();
     my $me = Perl::Guru->new( \%my_attributes );    # be honest!
     if ( $job->apply($me) ) {
	 $job->perform( \%intriguing_stuff );
     }
     else {
	 die "No hire";
     }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Want to work with a small team of highly-motivated Perl hackers?

Want the benefits of a large company without giving up that can-do startup
spirit?

Want to write code that makes the world better while also kicking the
competition's butt?

This may be a job for you.

=head2 WE ARE

We are part of a market-leading business unit of a Fortune 1000 software
company with operations in 40 countries.  We work on a mission-critical
system that quietly and effectively feeds oxygen to the rocket ship of our
product line.

We're smart and flexible and we get things done.

We fight spam.

=head2 YOU ARE

You are a rock-star hacker with a passion for great code and the track
record to prove it.

You love Perl but not to the exclusion of other things.
You also love being on a winning team.

You're serious but not boring, smart but not pretentions, funny but not
rude.  You have a life.

You're comfortable with complexity, unafraid of pressure, tolerant of
legacy code, passionate about quality, and dedicated to customer
satisfaction.

=head2 LOCATION^3

We work in the heart of beautiful downtown San Francisco, within easy
walking distance of some of the world's finest cultural and culinary
offerings.


=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=head2 ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVES

=over

=item Perl Expertise.

OOPerl, C<Class::*>, C<Apache::*>, C<Legacy::Complex::Voodoo>

=item Testing Experience.

C<Test::More> and more.

=item Solid Database Knowledge.

C<DBI> and C<Class::DBI> and a strong understanding of relational database
concepts and their application in the real world.

=item Senior/Lead Engineering Experience.

Something on the order of 10 years' experience, all of it interesting.

=item System Programming Experience.

     die unless $^O =~ /(li)?[nu]+i?x/i;

This position involves B<Heavy Lifting> on the server.
Candidates I<must> be fully able to geek out on difficult, esoteric
system-level weirdness in Perl and outside it.

=item Nerves of Steel.

This is the kind of job where you have to measure twice before you cut,
even if you have to do it very fast.
The business depends directly on your work.

=back

=head2 COOL-TO-HAVES

=over

=item More Languages.

We all speak C<Perl> but we speak other things as well.
If you're a C<Python>ite we'd like to hear about that.

=item Experience Shipping Commercial Software.

While this job is mostly about internal applications, we still live in a
world where software ships and ships fast.

=item Security Experience.

We are, after all, a security company.	Familiarity with the industry and
its challenges is a big plus.

=item Messaging (or similar) Experience.

Much of our work is about quickly analyzing breathtakingly large amounts of
e-mail-related data.  Experience building systems to parse and process
e-mail or similar types of data would be very nice.

=item Web Application Experience.

Some of our work involves purpose-built web applications, both internal and
public-facing:	C<mod_perl>, C<HTML::Mason>, and the like (plus a little
fancy Web 2.0 here and there).

=back

=head1 APPLICATION

To apply for this position, send the usual self-presentation package to:

     perl_guru@symantec.com

As the application process progresses we will at some point ask to see a
code sample; it must be an original work and free of any access
restrictions.  Time to bring your CPAN modules up to date!
