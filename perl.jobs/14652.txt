Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Surf Air

Location: Santa Monica, CA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Overview:

After delighting our members with flights for over a year, Surf Air
recently acquired funding to quintuple our current fleet of aircraft,
expanding over the next 18 months to over a dozen private airports
throughout California, in comfort, minus the lines and TSA hassles.

We are getting our systems ready to scale operations. This means, tighter
integration of third party systems, better interfaces, more stable code
base.

Our existing code base is in Perl. So some familiarity with the language is
required. However, whether you love Python, Node JS, Ruby or Go, and can
make an argument for why that's the thing to do for our future systems -
the future of our back end technology is up to you! (We are a unix shop
though - we have to draw the line somewhere!)

We are located in the heart of the Santa Monica Promenade, above a comedy
house. Sense of humor, however, is not required (though strongly
encouraged), experience working in a fast-moving environment is.

Our compensation package includes:

    Medical/Dental/Vision Benefits
    Flexible hours
    Unlimited Vacation
    Work from home options
    Stock Options
    401(K)

About Surf Air:

Surf Air is the first ever All-You-Can-Fly membership airline that launched
service in June of 2013. We currently provide scheduled daily flights on
executive aircraft to and from convenient local airports in the San
Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles metro area, Santa Barbara and Truckee Lake
Tahoe, with plans to expand nationwide. Surf Air brings back the ease and
allure of flying that has been lost in the endless lines, overburdened
systems and heavy fees. Forbes has called us "the future of flying". With
us, members save valuable time, eliminate the hassle of travel and fly with
outstanding service.

We're continuing to build an exceptional team of professionals looking to
revolutionize the flying experience with us. We hand-select each of our
team members based on their experience, passion, and the desire to be the
absolute best in their field. Surf Air provides immense growth potential as
we expand, in a culture that celebrates innovation and the entrepreneurial
mind.

These qualificationâ€™s are the minimum requirements. The most successful
applicants exceed these minimums.

Surf Air offers a comprehensive benefits package, competitive salary,
quality of life schedule, and an excellent work environment.
