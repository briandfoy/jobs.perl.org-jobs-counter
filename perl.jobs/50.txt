Subject: Looking for job in Baltimore
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: crohlfs@yahoo.com (Chris Rohlfs)

I am looking for work in the Baltimore, MD area, preferrably using perl,
but I'm open to anything. I would be especially interested in working as
a sort of apprentice sysadmin or dba.

As a hobby, I have been creating web sites with perl/CGI and mod_perl
for about 3 years. I have used MySQL and PostgreSQL with DBI, and I'm
pretty good with SQL. I've admin'd a dedicated linux server for a year,
with apache with mod_perl and mod_ssl, postgresql, etc.

Most of the sites I have built have been event registration systems, and
they have included community systems (with personal profiles, message
bases, matchmakers, invites) and accounting systems (edit registrant
info, items for sale, discounts, payment tracking). The system is
generic enought to be used simultainiously by multiple events, with most
configuration held in the database. I'm currently implementing work and
resource management features (being unemployed leaves lots of time for
hobbies!). 

My resume is up at http://www.seeken.org/resume.html
