Description:
I need to make some additional mods to Mojoscripts Personals software - a
Perl/CGI script that uses MySQL. 

The end product will be a job matching tool/service for the restaurant
industry.

An initial round of modifications have already been made by another. I'm
looking for an experienced, well organized and efficient programmer to wrap
it up.

The basic gist of the changes/additions revolve around providing a specific
user type the capability of searching candidates, selecting multiple
candidates, creating multiple Hotlists and sending mass emails.
