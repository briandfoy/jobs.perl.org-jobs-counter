Pay rate: $40 to $50 an hour

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 1yr to full time

Description:
my client who is looking for 3 mid-to-senior level LAMP/ PERL developers;

First, about the positions:

• If you know Perl, Javascript, SQL, and Linux in about that order, they’re
looking for you, this position is for mid-to-senior level developers
comfortable with writing both web (70%) and non-web (30%) applications in
Perl on Linux.
• If the idea of coding this week and trying to figure out the best way to
get the database to failover to a redundant server next week appeals to
you, you're probably a great candidate for my client.
• Experience with Oracle, PostgreSQL, AJAX and other Web 2.0 techniques,
bash scripting and UNIX/Linux administration aren't required, but will move
you to the front of the list.

Second, about my client:

• My client has been around since 1923. They are one of just a handful of
companies in the US that make and sell first-responder radio systems (known
as "land mobile radio" in the business). If you've seen firemen, police
officers, emergency crews, and others carrying around a radio the size of a
small brick, it might have been one of theirs or Motorola.
• BusinessWeek previously ranked them as one of the fastest growing public
companies in America, but are still a good size. There is a lot of room for
individuals to make big contributions and at the same time, they’re an
established company with a full benefit plan.
• My client is located in Las Colinas at 114 and 161 so they’re pretty
convenient from both the Dallas and Fort Worth side of the world.

Third, about the group:

Our group builds two kinds of software:

1) The software that allocates bandwidth and connects the radios to each
other (mostly C++ on an embedded platform).
2) The software that configures, monitors, and reports against the embedded
platform (a collection of web applications written mostly with Perl,
Oracle, and JavaScript on Linux/Apache).

As described above, my client is looking for help with the 2nd kind
