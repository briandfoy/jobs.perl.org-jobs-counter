Job title:
Manager / Lead (Perl) for ValueClick Media in Westwood or Westlake Village

Company name: ValueClick Media

Internal ID: 11251

Location: United States, CA, West L.A. or Westlake Village

Pay rate: Extremely competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
*** THIS ROLE IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE LOCATIONS SPECIFIED ABOVE. NO
CONTRACT OR TELECOMMUTING OPTION IS OFFERED AT THIS TIME. ***

This is a rare opportunity to join us in a leadership role while the iron
is hot; we're in a growth trajectory that rivals our early days as a
startup. We're extremely profitable, publicly-traded and consistently in
the top 4 of the pack, so you know you're taking your career to a place
where ideas and innovation can lean against stability and consistent
growth.

And the work is pretty interesting too. The fact that we deal with high
volume transactions (how’s close to hundreds of thousands of hits per
second sound?) and extremely large data sets makes our blood flow. We see
almost everything we touch go into production and have a direct impact on
how ValueClick has become one of the top, most profitable companies in the
space. All this without crazy, inhumane hours and with plenty of time to
play. This is why we come to work every day ready to save the world. Or at
the least, ready to create some really, really high quality software.

In this role, you'll be leading a team to develop new products or enhance
features of software applications that power any one of our many systems:
ad serving, behavioral targeting, real-time bidding and account management
portals. But by no means is this a hands-off role; we need you to be
involved in all phases of the development cycle: design, programming,
testing at the unit and system level, debugging and internal documentation.
Our Agile process enables us to have a very short feedback loop with our
product owners, so when you’re not coding, you’re working with our product
managers to get things just right.

Required skills:
For us, it's not about how large of a team you've led, it's about how well
can lead the technical / architectural direction of a group. Instead of
worrying about how long you’ve been an engineer or working with a specific
technology stack, we’re more focused on how quickly and independently
you’ve proven to design and develop solutions when given the problem. We’re
pretty language agnostic and if you’re a polyglot, you’ll be in good
company. We do, however need you to be interested and able to work with:

• Perl, OO Perl, mod_perl, some C/C++
• Linux including Apache web server
• Databases such as Oracle or MySql
• HTML5, Ajax and similar technologies
• Experience with the Agile development process (2 week sprints, daily
standups, software that actually works and is released while it's still
relevant) will be highly valued
