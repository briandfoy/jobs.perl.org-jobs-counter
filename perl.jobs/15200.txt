Hours: Full time

Description:
Besides being a Perl rockstar, are you also revered as a Linux Engineer,

time placing a title on your skill set? Are you often referred to as a

all of the above. The Perl Developer is responsible for designing,
architecting, developing and testing new web-based applications while also
addressing feature requests and other issues with production systems.
Qualified candidates should be Perl and Linux wizards and should be just as
good at "putting out fires" as they are at developing new code!

Desired skills:
SKILLS REQUIRED:
• Expert Perl programming experience.
• Experience with
both using and writing Perl modules.
• Expertise with relational databases
and SQL, preferably MySQL.
