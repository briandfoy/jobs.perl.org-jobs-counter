Job title:
CRUD Form Developer for Catalyst Application

Company name: Walker's Manual, Inc.

Location: NJ, Freehold

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Walker's Manual is currently developing a Perl application using the
Catalyst web framework and the DBIx::Class ORM. The database itself is
PostgreSQL, but this is hidden behind the ORM.

We are looking for a programmer to implement approximately six data entry
forms for the application. Some forms have already been developed using
HTML::Widget; however, HTML::Widget does not provide the validation
capabilities we need. Specifically, we need to validate consistency between
fields: does field a - field b = field c, for instance.

Required skills:
*Catalyst Web Framework
*DBIx::Class ORM
*DBIx::Class currency and date inflators.
*A deep understanding of a form validation framework that can be used
within Catalyst. We would consider FormBuilder with Data::Validator,
HTML::FormFu, or any suggested system that accomplishes our validation
goals.
