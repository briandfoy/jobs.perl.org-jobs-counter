Job title:
Backstop / Person to call if primary developer is hit by meteor

Company name: Online Talent Manager

Internal ID: Richard Part II 

Location: The Netherlands, Breda

Pay rate: 500 euros per month

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I have built a personality testing system in Perl.  It is a nice system and
everyone is happy, BUT if I am hit by a bus, struck by a meteor, hit by
lightning, or some other random calamity, someone else will need to pick up
the slack.
I will basically be paying you to come in for a couple hours every two
weeks <strike>to talk and drink coffee</strike> to keep you up to date with
how everything is working and to help out with specific coding problems.
The system is web based (LAMP), deals with statistics, SVG generation and
rendering, PDF rendering through Open Office, and has an API that several
other companies use.  So, you won't be bored.

Required skills:
You need to have a few years of Perl development under your belt.  You need
to be reliable, social, creative, and engaged.

Desired skills:
Perl - You read PBP and use a lot of Conway's tips.  You know who Damian
Conway is.  You have been to at least one Perl Monger meeting.
MySQL - optimization of database, crafting better queries.  I use DBI.
Apache 2 -  you know when it is reasonable to move to mod_perl
Linux - servers are Debian and you use linux every day.
You know enough about Windows and Macs that you could install a printer
driver for someone in the office.
You think personality testing is interesting.
