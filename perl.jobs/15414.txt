Job title: Pay Button Integration

Company name: Not Applicable

Location: San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico

Pay rate: US dollars

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
Since September 2015 this job has been posted and now almost February 2016
it is still available.. Dudes get on the ball..!!!

What I need is an
integration in PERL for a Pay Button to achieve a split Bitcoin payment
with the www.coinkite.com API.

Imagine a buyer purchasing an item with
value of 100, 

When the buyer clicks the "Check Out" button instead of
paying one person, the single payment gets splitted into two deposits to
two different recipients at once, (15 % to the affiliate and 75 % to the
vendor).

or two different wallets from the same person. (15 % to the
bitcoin wallet and 75 % to the dollar wallet).

You can see an example
here: 

https://coinkite.com/faq/forward

Since I posted this, someone was
gracious enough to upload a perl authentication routine for this
integration at github so the jobs is partly already done for you:

https://github.com/web2solutions/coinkite-perl/blob/master/sign.pl

I'm
eager to start right away, send me a quote to sebglanzer@gmail.com or if
you have questions contact me at sebastian.glanzer (Skype ID)



Thanx

Desired skills:
Preferably some knowledge as to how bitcoins work, 

Jason/Perl
