Description:
Perl Web Developer/Programmer - Junior to Intermediate - Full Time ***
Telecommute ***

You eat, sleep and breathe software design and web development. You are an
independent thinker with awesome ideas, yet know how to play well with
others.  You are a team player, hard working and able to conceive and
execute solutions in a timely fashion.	You are an energetic, creative
individual who is able to efficiently communicate with team members and
clients as needed.  You bring a strong sense of both code and interface
design.

You can work with others’ code, but yours is always neater and better
optimized and you comment well. You are better than proficient in Perl and
PHP is a huge plus. You can whip up JavaScript and CSS by hand that others
drool over for dynamic site layouts.  You know when and how to create
dynamic user-friendly web interfaces and you recognize when eye candy stops
being functional.

You are a self-starter who knows how to manage your time and be productive
while working in your home office.  You enjoy sitting on your balcony
working in your underwear from home without having to shave (legs or face)
or bush your hair to come to work.  You might find yourself in an
afterhours battle to prove your video game supremacy.	You like to have
fun and know when to get down to business.  You don't take yourself as
seriously as you do your work.

You know you’re a pro, and you realize there is always room to grow. 
You’re willing to adapt to new technologies and business process’.  You’re
capable of using web based project and case management tools to keep track
of progress and time.  You are willing to work on the Mountain Time Zone
(Denver, CO / SLC, UT / Calgary, Canada).

You don’t mind providing client support, trouble shooting, or working on
bug fixes. You don’t mind holding a clients hand (if needed) or helping to
solve their issues.  At times, you could be in direct communication with
clients and you look forward to clearly and precisely addressing their
needs.

You always build things that you are proud of.
