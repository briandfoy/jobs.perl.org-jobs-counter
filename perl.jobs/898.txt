Job title: Perl / DotNet Programmer

Company name: ziStudio.net

Location: Canada, Alberta, Edmonton

Pay rate: Negotiable / Contract

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Description:
I've some perl code that a was written for us that I need ported to a dot
net language. 

 It was written by a programmer that left the company about a year ago. 
Theres a couple hundred lines of code it that is currently in production so
there is no design work and no debugging.  It shouldn't be a big project. 
As far as I can see its theres two ways to do it. translate it into a dot
net language  either vb.net or c# or to use something like perl.net.  The
code itself uses a lot of regular expressions and some database lookups. 



Required skills:
Understanding of database calls, Regular Expressions, Perl and dotnet
assemblies
