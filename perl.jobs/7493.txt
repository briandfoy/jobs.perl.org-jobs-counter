Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Ongoing

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are seeking an experienced Perl Developer to collaborate with business
and technical staff to design, develop and maintain G2’s applications and
internal systems. Who are we? G2 Web Services is a fast growing leader in
Internet Compliance monitoring, located in Bellevue, WA. We're profitable,
not bound by venture capitalists, and actively extending existing
infrastructure. G2 believes that happy employees create better products, so
we work with you on tools you need, provide snacks and drinks for free, and
give you a choice of OS X, Windows, or Linux on your desktop before you
come to work. 

You would assist our extraordinary development team in creating and
extending cool technologies scouring data all over the Internet and
attempting to make sense of it. The ideal person knows how to work by
themselves as well as with others, and works well in a fast-paced
environment. You should know how to build modules in Perl, have experience
in object oriented programming, and be able to talk about it as a human
being, not as a textbook. 

Your responsibilities include: 
* Implementing scalable, robust, parallel systems interacting with very
large data sets 
* Working on new ways to parse, mine, and otherwise deal with completely
unstructured data 
* Optimizing, profiling and debugging existing software to make it
stronger, better, and faster 
* Writing, optimizing and maintaining fast, intelligent interfaces between
distributed components and systems over multiple locations 



If you feel like this job description is general in spots, you’re right, it
is. G2 has a number of sensitive clients, many projects on the go, and we
can’t give it all away here. If you’re the kind of developer who loves
tackling hard problems and dealing with complex systems: we’ve got them. As
a progressive employer, we offer a competitive salary based on your
experience and fit, with a complete benefits package as well as growth
opportunities in a flexible work environment. If you're interested, forward
a cover letter, resume, and code examples if you have them to
jobs@g2llc.com.

Required skills:
Skills you must have: 
* A very strong foundation in Object Oriented Perl and object oriented
methodologies 
* Experience and some ability in other object oriented languages, such as
C++, Ruby, Python, PHP, or Java 
* Familiarity and extensive use of CPAN modules -- Especially if you've
ever contributed 
* Experience and familiarity with MySQL or PostgreSQL 
* Proven problem solving and analytical ability 


Desired skills:
What we'd like to see: 
* Experience with concurrent computing, using multithreading or other types
of parallel processing 
* Work in start-up like environments, and/or commercial software
development 
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience preferred 

* Understanding, and preferably experience with, socket programming or web
protocols with Perl
