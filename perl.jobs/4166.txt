Description:
Have you ever wanted to:
*Develop cool applications that millions of people will see and use on a
daily basis?
*Be part of a company that serves the public good?
*Help a hometown business stomp its friendly national competitors?

Here's your opportunity:
More than 4 million users come to Boston.com every month, and they will be
using the tools you build and refine to search for a job or a home, or the
latest news.  In this role, you will design and maintain databases that
work with a myriad of systems using various programming and scripting
languages. Development is done in a mixed environment with Perl, Python, C,
and Java/J2EE with Oracle databases supporting the applications. Ideally
you will have professional experience in any of the above and provide a
best practices approach to each project.

We have a small Tech group where you can work on a variety of projects for
different aspects of the site.	Our philosophy is that our developers
should use whatever tools they want from whatever source, as long as the
result works well; we don’t like to be dogmatic about development.

Also, you will get to work in a collaborative atmosphere with many smart
people, including
*Our product managers, who manage large projects like redesigns for our
sections.
*Our editorial staff, who rely upon our content management system to get
news and information to our users.
*Our talented designers who create the UI of your backend work.


Required skills:

So, who are we looking for?
First of all, you love the web and its endless possibilities, and you
believe in the power of the media to improve our communities.  That said,
here are the requirements for the position:
*A Computer Science degree, or equivalent industry experience.
*Professional experience in Perl, Python, C, or Java/J2EE.
*Content Management systems experience a must.
*Deep knowledge of content management system concepts along with real world
applications development required. Must have proven experience in
integration as well as development. 
*Proven experience in designing, developing, and releasing quality products
with a continuous release lifecycle. High performance, high availability
products a huge plus
*Fluency in analyzing legacy Perl, Python, and shell scripts a must
*Expert knowledge of Linux development and deployment environments
*Available for 24 hours on-call on a shared, rotational basis
*The department head is not a micromanager, so you should enjoy working
independently.
