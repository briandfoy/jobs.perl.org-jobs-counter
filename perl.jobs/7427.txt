Job title: Web Application Developer

Company name: SingleFeed

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
SingleFeed is seeking a serious full-time web application developer to
start immediately.

Agile development practices. Rapid pace at a startup.

SingleFeed is a venture-backed start up with real customers and real
revenue. Our funding comes from two prominent early-stage VCs, True
Ventures and NetService Ventures, the backers of companies like Automattic,
Aggregate Knowledge, and Meebo.  

SingleFeed is a web service which enables merchants to effectively market
their goods through shopping search engines such as Google Product Search,
Yahoo! Shopping, Shopzilla, and PriceGrabber by managing and submitting
high quality product data feeds. Each shopping engine has a different
specification for how they want product data feeds to be delivered. Each
shopping engine also has a different algorithm for how they rank products.
SingleFeed’s goal is to get merchants up and running quickly and easily on
multiple shopping engines while helping merchants achieve the highest ROI
possible.

We are seeking someone to play a senior role in conceiving, designing and
implementing SingleFeed’s data feed management and optimization service. 
This is an exciting business that is growing rapidly, and we need someone
who can quickly translate business needs and customer feedback into
implemented features that together make a robust system.

The position requires the ability to design systems, communicate and work
effectively with others, write high quality scalable code, and deliver work
on schedule. The candidate must have high standards with regard to the
quality and maintainability of the system.  Foremost, you must be a
top-notch coder with a track record of solving hard problems quickly and
elegantly.

The candidate must be a very experienced web developer with background in
Perl and other scripting languages as well as having worked with a strongly
typed object-oriented language such as Java or C++.  Expertise in SQL
databases is required and specific experience with mySQL is a plus. 
Knowledge of front-end development using JavaScript and AJAX techniques is
also necessary.  

Experience with common software engineering tools and processes is
necessary.

The ability to work in concert with a small team of passionate engineers,
designers and product managers is essential.

You will have to take a tech test, so only serious candidates should apply.

Required skills:
• Bachelor's degree in computer science or other technical field, or
equivalent work experience. Master's or similar experience, is a plus.
• Significant experience shipping commercial software or building critical
components of highly trafficked websites
• Five years of experience with design and implementation using the
following technologies: 
- server-side web development using Perl, PHP or Java (significant portions
of the system are written in Perl, so you need to have recent experience
with Perl). 
- client side using DHTML and JavaScript
- databases (Oracle, mySQL)
