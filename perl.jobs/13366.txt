Job title: Principal Software Design Engineer

Company name: Chargesmart

Location: San Francisco, CA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Chargesmart.com is a rapidly expanding bill payment website with an
established user base and thousands of payments processed daily.  We’re
getting ready to launch a completely redesigned and modernized
frontend/backend, and we’re seeking an experienced full stack web engineer
to support and expand the site post-launch.  Our mission is to make the
bill payment experience as frictionless as possible, and to that end we
value people that are fanatical about the end-user experience.

Chargesmart is headquartered San Francisco, CA and recently moved into a
killer new office in the SoMa district with easy access to BART.  As part
of VeriFone, we offer full benefits, and competitive pay.

Required skills:
We’re a small team and you’ll have a chance to work on a bit of everything.
 Our backend is a perl Dancer app that interacts with the frontend via our
RESTful API.  The frontend is almost entirely implemented with backbone.js
and bootstrap. Behind all of that, we have integrations to various payment
processors to settle and remit funds.  We do have a good chunk of legacy
perl code that we're slowly updating to use modern design methodologies
(Moose, etc)

Our ideal candidate has:

•	Expert JS skills and has built web apps using backbone.js or
another JS framework.  
•	modern OO perl experience (or experience with another modern
scripting language like ruby or python and is willing to learn)
•	Has worked with dancer or another mvc framework (rails, flask, etc)

•	Used bootstrap and can explain why responsive design is important. 

•	Solid MySQL experience, plus familiarity with postgres.

Desired skills:
It’d be great if you also have: 

•	Experience in the payments industry (particularly PCI-DSS
compliance)
•	Sysadmin experience.  We manage our own infrastructure, and
familiarity with nginx, spacewalk, memcached, basic networking principles,
backups, etc are always helpful to have.
•	An interest or experience with risk analytics.	We’re constantly
improving our risk algorithms to reduce fraudulent transactions.  
•	A sense of humor.
