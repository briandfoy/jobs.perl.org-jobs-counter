legitimate content.

Cloudmark provides messaging security services to customers around the
world, including Comcast, Cox Communications, EarthLink, NEC Biglobe,

recently added a Hadoop cluster to the mix. We realize that the fight
against spam changes daily and are open to using the right tool for the
job. We encourage new ideas and experimentation in our engineering team.

against messaging abuse.

query optimization, schema design)  
* Experience programming against a very large MySQL database and achieving
very high performance is a plus.
