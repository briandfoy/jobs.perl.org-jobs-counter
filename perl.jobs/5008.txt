Job title:
Perl / CGI genius for music research consultancy with dynamic e-commerce
site

Company name: London Music Thing

Location: United Kingdom, London, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
We are a small London consultancy and publishing company focused upon the
digital music business. We have a website which delivers documents on a
regular basis to our subscribers, and also a backend which contains the
customer database. This is built with CGI / Perl.

After several years of sterling work, our India-based web developer is
letting us down and we want to find someone in the UK who can analyse,
learn, then take over the site. The first project would be to reskin the
site with a new graphical look that has been created by a third party - the
images and CSS are ready to go. Thereafter it would be a matter of
maintaining the site and building additional components as and when we need
them.

Once the initial set-up phase has passed it will probably require just a
few hours here and there every week to keep things ticking over. We're
happy to look at various ways of working but will be most amenable to
someone we can meet here in London.

Please get in touch with your resume and portfolio or list of sites you
have worked on. 

Required skills: CGI / Perl / HTML

Desired skills:
Flash and some abilities with Photoshop would be an advantage but are by no
means necessary
