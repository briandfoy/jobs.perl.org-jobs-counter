Job title: Primary Developer

Company name:
BookFinder.com (subsidiary of AbeBooks/Amazon)

Internal ID: VDEV

Location: Canada, British Columbia, Victoria

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
BookFinder.com is an ecommerce search engine that searches over 150 million
books for sale -- new, used, rare, and out-of-print. We are looking for a
primary developer.

Responsibilities:
As one of the primary developers of BookFinder.com, an entirely Perl-based
ecommerce search engine, you will be involved with all aspects of its
development. From product design, maintenance, to project direction, you'll
have to do a little of everything. We're looking for someone who's
self-motivated, and willing to take responsibility for new ideas and
initiatives.

Being part of a small company, your input will be very important. There are
no silos here -- you'll be expected to work with others, to take into
account factors like analytics, marketing, and budgeting when making
decisions about your product. We're a small team, and members generally
fill multiple roles; versatility and flexible are critical, and we'll
support you as you pick up new skills.


Background:
Founded in 1999, BookFinder.com is a small ecommerce search company
headquartered in Berkeley, California (an independently managed subsidiary
of AbeBooks, recently acquired by Amazon). We currently have 2 full-time
employees in Berkeley, and 5 part-timers located in Victoria, Canada, and
Dusseldorf, Germany.

You'll be working in a small, friendly, cooperative team. As a tiny
subsidiary of AbeBooks / Amazon, we offer the benefits of working at a
small company (e.g. every employee can affect the product), but with the
stability and resources of a larger company behind us.

Technologies used at BookFinder.com:

CentOS Linux (based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Perl + CPAN, Apache +
mod_perl + Mason, MySQL, Git


Required skills:
2 year experience with Perl web application development.

Familiarity with Linux command line environment  and tools (editors, source
code control, services and daemons, etc). 

Ability to work in an environment with rapidly changing priorities. 

Good written and in-person communication skills

Interest in non-technical side of the business

Knowledge of HTML/CSS, with some Javascript

Desired skills:
Database/SQL experience

Love of books and reading
