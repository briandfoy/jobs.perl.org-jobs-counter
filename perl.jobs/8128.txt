Description:
SiteSpect is a software innovator in the fast-growing space of Web

non-intrusive Web site conversion optimization solutions.  Our unique
technology allows Web marketers to test and optimize every aspect of their
Web site without requiring any changes to content.  SiteSpect's

The Senior Software Engineer position is responsible for development and
evolution of our core products. This is a mid- to senior-level technical
position that requires a background in multi-tier application development
with an emphasis on Web systems. You will collaborate with other talented
software engineers, sharing your own skills and ideas while simultaneously
learning from others.

The roles for this position span system design and architecture, software

performance optimization. We have an exciting development roadmap with many
challenging projects ahead.

This is a full time position located in our office in downtown Boston, MA.
We are minutes away from Park Street MBTA stop, central to all subway and
commuter rail lines.  A very cool office space with excellent options for
lunch and after-work activities.

Required skills:
    * 5+ years of programming using Perl, mod_perl, and C

CSS

    * LAMP stack

    * thorough understanding of SQL

    * Unix environment

    * experience with revision control 

Desired skills:

experience creating software that utilizes scientific, mathematical, and
algorithmic complexity. An academic background in a technical or research
field is also beneficial.

Candidates should have experience working in small teams alongside other
engineers and product managers. You should be comfortable with the dynamic
and fast pace that is typical for an Internet software startup (work hard,
play hard).
