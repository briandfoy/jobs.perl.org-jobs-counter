Job title:
software programmer for a commerce site design

Company name: Caltech

Location: United States, CA, Pasadena

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
A researcher in Caltech asks for some help in building a test site for a
combinatorial exchange for economic experiments. A potential application
includes spectrum allocation. 

Some reference screenshots are
http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/31/releases/screenshots.pdf 
But the site does not have to be of industrial strength, since the goal is
to test economic rationals of some proposed systems and not to test system
for acutal business and policy implementation.	It should run on UNIX and
accomodate human experiments using ~15 subjects and ~10 objects. 

Let me make absolutely clear that this project is academic and for public
interests and has no connection with any government agencies and
industries. 

We wish to implement the system and start running the experiment by the end
of this month.	

Required skills:
Html, Perl, C, Matlab, etc. As long as the code works, any language is
fine.

Contact information:
If you are interested, will you send me your contact and a rough estimate
to summer_2003_1@yahoo.com Thank you.
