Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: The Conference Exchange

Location: Cumberland, Rhode Island, United States

Pay rate: Competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
**No consultants, and only local applicants, please. This is a full-time,
on-site position.

The Conference Exchange (http://www.confex.com/) is hiring a developer to
work on our conference management software. We help professional societies
collect and manage hundreds of thousands of abstracts, manuscripts, and
other files. Our focus is on the content: collecting it, organizing it, and
sharing it online. We do this using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl) and
other open source technologies.

On this job you will be primarily writing code based on the requests of our
support team and clients. Our web app is written in OO Perl. When you
begin, you will work on simple bug fixes; support staff writes up the
requirements and design and as a developer you will implement their
request. Once situated and knowledgeable in Perl and the nuances of our
code base, you will be assigned projects that add new functionality to our
system; this would include writing your own requirements, design, UI, etc.
Support would approve your design, and then you would get to implement it
from the ground up.

You will be working on a team of 7 developers and while we all work on
tasks separately, questions and white board discussions are common. You
will be expected to learn the basics of Perl before you start, but we will
teach you the finer points of the language on the job. For the first week
you will learn the basics of how to access the code base, our object model;
the high level 'what we do and how we do it' items. Then you're off and
running writing code with your first bug fix/small client level
enhancements. 

Details/Benefits
* Full time, with benefits.
* Fast-paced, 40 hr/wk position.
* Flexible hours.
* Part-time telecommuting opportunities once situated.
* Casual, open-office environment. No cubicles
* 1 hour south of Boston

Required skills:
* Experience in OO Perl with at least 3 months software development
experience on the job. (yes, internships count)
* Excellent attention to detail, communication skills, and ability to learn
quickly.

Desired skills:
* Experience with MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
* Knowledge of inner workings of systems and/or database
