Description:
Come work for a leader in IP telephony!

Fonality is a young, well-funded software company based in Los Angeles. We
provide a unique software-based PBX phone system on the bleeding edge of
technology that outperforms many enterprise-level PBX phone systems at a
fraction of the cost. Customers have placed over 50M calls on our system
and currently average more than 1.5M calls a week. Fonality brings the
power of Open Source to the huge telecommunications market!

We are seeking Junior and Senior level Developers with experience creating
backend and web applications using Perl and mod_perl/Template Toolkit. With
some of the smartest people in the telephony business working for us, this
is a great opportunity to jump onboard and work with people who are
passionate about what they do. Fonality is making an impact in the industry
and creating new paradigms for service delivery.

Our primary product consists of a high-level, intuitive, web-based
interface to the open-source PBX software (phone system), Asterisk. We've
also built various other desktop applications and APIs that interface with
our system and Asterisk. You’ll be responsible for developing, testing, and
maintaining new and existing systems written in Perl within a Linux
environment. You should be a creative thinker and have good communication
skills as you will interface with team members to ensure the smooth
deployment of software.  

Fonality is rapidly growing and this position is a great opportunity to get
in on the ground floor. Salary is based on knowledge and hard work, not
experience – the way it should be. We offer health insurance from day one
and a very competitive benefits package. Check us out at: www.fonality.com.
