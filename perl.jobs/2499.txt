Job title:
Perl-loving enthusiastic web programmer for library book company

Company name: Follett Library Resources

Location: United States, IL, McHenry

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
If you're looking for a great job with a great company in a great industry,
where you can set down some roots and stay for the long haul, while having
fun doing it, come work for the Web Development department at Follett
Library Resources in McHenry, IL.

Here are ten reasons to come work with us:

1) We write mostly in Perl, the most fun you can have writing code.

2) Our team is not mired in politics.  There's hierarchy, but we're all
technical peers.  If someone's got a way to improve someone else's code,
then we want to hear it, even if it's the boss's code.	The boss has to
follow the coding standards, too.

3) We live & breathe automated testing.  It makes things much harder to
mess up without knowing it.  We've adopted a number of agile development
processes, although we're certainly not a full-blown XP shop.

4) The company's mission statement talks about "lifelong learning," and as
a group we take that seriously.  You'll learn as you go, and help teach the
rest of us as well.

5) You won't be bored.	We've got two years of projects awaiting us.  The
projects we work on constantly amaze and astound our customers.

6) We're not a sweatshop.  We look at project schedules realistically.	You
won't have any nonsense like the company president saying "Do this 6-month
project in 3 weeks".  We estimate our own projects, rather than having them
handed to us.

7) We are immersed in Open Source.  Linux, Apache, Perl, CPAN, mod_perl,
Template Toolkit, vim and Subversion are all our tools we use daily.  (Ok,
we do use Oracle for our heavy database work.)

8) We're more like a football team than a bunch of golfers.  Everyone works
with, relies on, and supports everyone else.

9) TITLEWAVE is of vital importance to the future of the company.  It's one
of the key differentiators in our marketplace.	This is code that helps
make us profitable, not Yet Another Accounting System.

10) We enjoy coming to work in the morning.  Our work is enjoyable, and we
work in an important industry.	We go home at the end of the day knowing
that we help get books in the hands of kids.


Required skills:
Minimal skills required: 2+ years of application programming experience,
with web applications a big plus.  You must be well-versed in
object-oriented design and coding, experienced in writing applications,
know HTML and SQL, and be proficient using shell-based Linux/Unix as a
development platform.  Excellent written/verbal communication is a must. 
Most important, you must be a good fit with our team.

Contact information:
We offer a competitive salary and an excellent benefits package including
medical and dental coverage, a generous 401k plan, profit sharing, flexible
spending and 529 plans, full undergraduate tuition reimbursement, earned
time off in the first year and more. We provide a pleasant office
environment in our state-of-the-art headquarters and distribution center in
McHenry, Illinois, a far northwestern suburb of Chicago. We prefer
candidates to fax or e-mail resume with cover letter and salary
requirements to:
