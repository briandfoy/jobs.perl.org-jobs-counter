Job title: inventor name disambiguation

Company name: University of Notre Dame

Location: Notre Dame, IN, United States

Pay rate: $3000

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I am a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, doing
research on the economics of innovation. I need to hire a perl developer to
help me disambiguate inventor names, application years, and several other
characteristics from large text files containing OCR versions of United
States Patent Data. You can see examples of these files here:
http://patents.reedtech.com/pgocr.php
I need the perl code to be written in
such a way that we can easily modify it as need arises	(this means I need
code that is well-commented and designed in a transparent way, and I need a
developer who is able and willing to communicate with me about the code). I
am hoping to have the project done within three weeks.

Desired skills:
I need a good perl developer, and someone who can communicate with me well.
Many thanks!
