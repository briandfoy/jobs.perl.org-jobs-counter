Description:
Large publishing company is looking for software developers to work on
dynamic content websites, ecommerce systems, and in-house administrative /

We strive to write clean object-oriented code and make judicious use of
CPAN.  We are open source friendly, both in terms of using and contributing
to open source.

In addition to other engineers, you will interact with designers and a

Excellent written and verbal communication skills are essential.

We have positions located in our New York City (midtown) office and San
Francisco.

Significant experience working in a Unix environment (preferably Linux),
strong Perl development skills, with some relational database (MySQL
preferred) are all an absolute must. Previous work with secure servers and
ecommerce systems is a plus . A working knowledge of HTML, XML, and
JavaScript is expected. Any experience with AJAX is also a plus.

Desired skills:
This is a software development position, however experience with mod_perl,
MySQL, and/or HTML::Mason is a big plus. Other things we 'd find to be a
plus are experience with Apache configuration, Linux system administration,
and any database administration.
