Job title: GeoIP Release Engineer

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
MaxMind is looking for a talented and highly motivated person to help us
build, release, and improve our GeoIP databases. This is a great
opportunity for someone with some background with Linux and programming who
is interested in becoming a software engineer. Our GeoIP data is used by
thousands of companies around the world, including most of the worldâ€™s most
visited websites.

Founded in 2002, MaxMind is an industry-leading provider
of IP intelligence and online fraud detection tools. MaxMind is privately
held and based in Waltham, Massachusetts.


The Position

Every week we
release a few dozen GeoIP databases in various formats. To do so we must
prepare the input data, transform it using multiple build steps, and check
the quality of the output against the previous release.

As part of the
existing process we always look for ways to improve our data quality. We
also want to improve the build code and automate the build steps.
Ultimately, this will result in a more efficient release cycle.

You will
be responsible for both managing the current build process and improving
it. This will involve documenting the current build process as you go,
using command line tools, maintaining the legacy build code in Perl, and
automating the build process, and refactoring and rewriting parts in modern
Perl as appropriate.

MaxMind will provide a dedicated, in-office
programmer to pair with, give guidance, and review code. We will also
provide paid time and a budget for learning opportunities as appropriate.


Working at MaxMind

We're a casual, friendly, results-focused company of
about 30 employees. We want you to get things done, but it's also important
to have a life outside the office.

In addition to competitive
compensation, we offer excellent medical, dental, vision, life, and short
and long term disability insurance, a Safe Harbor 401(k) with employer
contribution, FSA/DCA, and transit reimbursement.

This position requires
you to work from our office, which is located near downtown Waltham, MA,
outside of Boston, a five minute walk from the nearest commuter rail line
and several express bus lines.

Desired skills:
Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities

Unlike most positions which seek
existing ability to do a job, we are looking for someone who can grow into
a software engineer.

In particular, we are looking for someone who has:

-
High aptitude with logic and mathematics and the ability to learn new
programming languages, including Perl
- Experience with Linux/Unix, command
line tools, and some programming background
- Comfort working with large
amounts of data in sometimes messy datasets
- A willingness to work with
and make improvements to a large, crufty legacy codebase
