Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Google.Com Engineering
======================
Are you part ace coder, part adrenaline junkie? Do you have a knack for
seeing a problem and immediately discerning the likely solution? Maybe
you've been coding for years, are bored with the old
design-build-review-test-ship-repeat routine, and yearn for some
faster-paced challenges? Or perhaps you're a seasoned software engineer who
is also a genius at jockeying networks and administering UNIX clusters. 

We're looking for top-notch thrill seeking, software engineers to join the
Google.com team. Google.com engineers are in the thick of everything
involved with keeping Google running, from code-level troubleshooting of
traffic anomalies to maintenance of our most cutting edge services; from
monitoring and alerts to building new automation infrastructure. We are
aggressively building this elite team of high level engineers in this
mission critical environment. All team members must have strong analytical
and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding, good communication skills,
and most of all enthusiasm for tackling the complex problems of scale which
are uniquely Google. Google.com engineers tackle challenging, novel
situations every day, and work with just about every other engineering and
operations team in the process. 


Required skills:
- Strong programming/scripting skills in any of the following: C, C++,
Java, Perl, Python. 

- Senior Level experience with Unix system administration. 

- Strong understanding of networking; understanding of how to isolate,
diagnose, and resolve service delivery components (service delivery
components include servers, networks, and applications); be familiar with
the functionality, operating, and failure modes of key networking devices
(routers, switches, bridges, firewalls, hardware load balancers); be able
to identify networking as the potential cause of a service issue using
server-resident tools to generate this data (tcpdump, ping, traceroute,
etc.); familiarity in interpreting the output of these tools; familiarity
with common network topologies, protocols, and tools; have some notion of
common network security exploits -- and their remedies; understanding of
troubleshooting at the packet level. 

- Strong project management skills, especially in deploying live end-user
systems. 

- In-depth knowledge of Unix (preferably Linux), and shell scripting. 

- Proven technical troubleshooting experience. 

- Excellent analytic ability, strong communication skills, and a strong
sense of urgency. 

- Ability to handle periodic on-call duty as well as out-of-band requests. 


- 6-15+ years experience for Senior SWE position, or 3-8 years experience
for SWE position. 

- BA/BS in CS, or equivalent experience.
