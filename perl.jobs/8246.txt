Job title:
Experienced Web Developer for Perl/MySQL custom CMS. No Gantt Charts on
this project!

Company name: n/a

Internal ID: n/a

Location: United Kingdom, not given

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: initially 2/3 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Technically, this is a classic CMS upgrade gig - you'll need to get to
grips with an existing custom Perl and MySQL powered CMS, build in new
functionality, along with optimising the existing codebase where necessary.
The application is focused around the delivery of online assessments to
thousands of users at a time.

The site is heavily templated, with existing visual designs, and along with
excellent Perl and MySQL skills, you'll need a decent grasp of css, html
and in particular javascript, so classic web developer territory. 

Project wise, This will be a fixed deliverable project initially, but my
client base for this application is rapidly expanding, so there's the
opportunity for continuing development work on the application.

You'll work directly with me, the business owner, where we'll spec out
functionality together and build in an iterative process. No heavy project
management stuff, just good old coding and problem solving.

While experience and skill is important, I'm particularly looking for
someone who is very comfortable with loose specs, a loose project style and
can take the lead on this project and make it their own.

You'll need to be superbly self-organised, and be the sort of person that
tends to find themselves managing clients, not the other way around!

If you like pre-existing detailed specs, absolute deadlines, and detailed
task-led projects up front, this won't be the gig for you! 

However, if you can turn a set of conversations, a 'poke around' at a
codebase, and some visual sketches into a detailed spec, sets of tasks and
work to a self-imposed deadline, then this project is *definitely* for you!

Required skills:
Experienced Web Development skillset: a high level of experience with Perl,
MySQL, DBI, Apache config, Javascript, general Unix (Debian preferred) *nix
chops to manage deployments etc.

Desired skills:
I'd expect you to have several years experience of working with custom
CMSs. 

As I'm looking for the classic 'self starter', CPAN contributions, or
similar code contributions will be of interest.
