Job title: Senior Programmer - Perl and C

Company name: AlertSite

Location: United States, Florida, Coconut Creek

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Are you looking for an opportunity to show how your skills can make things
happen every day?  A company where you won't be lost in the crowd?  A place
where you can make an impact?  You've come to the right place.

AlertSite is a leading provider of web performance measurement, system
monitoring and security vulnerability scanning products that ensure a
customer's critical web-based services are always available and running at
peak performance.  Founded in 1998, AlertSite is based in Coconut Creek, FL
and offers a fast paced, challenging work environment as well as a
competitive compensation and benefits plan.

We are currently seeking a Senior Programmer with a minimum of 5 - 7 years
experience developing with Perl and C to design and implement AlertSite
systems, review installation of third party products, and investigate and
resolve bugs. 

We are looking for someone who understands that Perl is a very serious,
high-level programming language used in large, complex, high-performance
applications, and not just a "scripting tool." We love Perl, and so should
you.  Experience with Windows will not be held against you, but development
is performed exclusively on Linux.  You should be at home on Linux, BSD, or
Unix variants.

Required skills:
5+ years programming in Perl in a Linux environment
5+ years programming in C
SQL experience (we use MySQL)
Full project life cycle experience
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Highly motivated, able to work both in a team and solo
Must be able to meet deadlines and work well under pressure
Strong attention to detail
