Subject: Talented Perl Developer Wanted (telecommute) United States, California, San Fran
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: sd_jobs@hotmail.com ((PerlDiscuss - Perl Newsgroups and mailing lists))

Alternative lifestyle, community-oriented, Internet-based company is
seeking a talented and motivated freelance PERL developer to help build
Web apps for our Website. Applicant must be experienced, highly motivated,
and intimately familiar with both PERL (mod_perl), SQL (MySQL), as well as
javascript and HTML.
Existing codebase is very clean and well-commented, but not
object-oriented, on a FreeBSD box, running Apache/mod_perl and MySQL. Site
is strongly user-centered, and though new enjoys a fair amount of success
with more than 6000 users.

We're a privately held, two-person company. Position is not salaried, but
compensation will include extended (and generous) profit sharing.

This is a part-time (10-20 hrs/wk +) work-from-home position. Applicant
should be hyper-communicative and self-motivating.

Please send your resume/3 references/and code samples (needed for style
examination only, they do not need to be functional) to
sd_jobs@hotmail.com.
