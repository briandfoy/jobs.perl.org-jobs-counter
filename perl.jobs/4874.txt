Job title:
Full-Time Perl Hacker looking to move to Ruby

Company name: Stealth LA dot com

Location: United States, CA, West Hollywood

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Description:
We are a Los Angeles internet start-up, looking for Employee #7. The six of
us that are already here are working on a great concept that we believe
will attract extremely large numbers of users in a very short amount of
time. We are smart, talented, and experienced, and we need another like us
to get this thing shipped.

No, it is not porn.

It is secret, though, for now. What we can tell you is that it is something
your friends and family would use, involves applying advanced algorithms to
simplify complex ideas for the consumer user, and will feature a very high
level of interactivity.

You may now be thinking, "It sounds like Web 2.0." To which we reply, "You
keep using that term. I do not think it means what you think it means." To
which you may say, "Well, I know it when I see it." To which we may then
declare, "You're hired." (See below for more on the collection of
technologies we are applying to the task.)

This is the classic start-up experience, transplanted from the Bay Area
with a couple of improvements. For one, we've just closed on funding, which
means you can still get in early: order your new machine, pick where you
want to sit, create a fresh code base. We're even getting some fancy
chairs. Not Aerons, though -- we all know what happens to companies that
buy those.

Other perks: we don't have a chef on staff (yet), but we do have a tab at
the cafe downstairs. We're also flexible with compensation (equity vs.
salary slider) and offer great benefits and relocation packages, too.


Who Will I Be Working With?
--------------------------------------------------

You'll be the newest member of our development team, which currently
numbers four and is evenly split between developers and designers.  We've
logged time at a few powerhouses (Yahoo, eBay, PayPal) and one of the early
social networks (Tribe). We've also paid our dues at a few good schools
(CalPoly, NYU, Stanford, UIUC, Wesleyan).

You'll also be working with a former PayPal executive from that company's
early days, rumored to be the person who shaped the product and focused it
into the success it is today. We plan to do the same thing all over again.

Who you won't be working with: good-natured but ultimately clueless
managers. Giant, top-heavy org charts. That one guy in legal who seems to
be angry all the time.

We've got a great team here, balanced with cleverness and humor. If you are
the go-to guy (or gal) in your organization, enjoy making decisions as well
as executing on them, and like playing with new technologies, you'll fit
right in.


What Technologies?
--------------------------------------------------

We are interested in going fast and working smart (as opposed to just
working hard). We've chosen Ruby on Rails and Perl for our platform, MySQL
for the database, and will be deploying on Linux. On the front end, we are
using AJAX, DHTML, and standards-compliant CSS to get those polished
interactions we mentioned.


Los Angeles?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes, Los Angeles. West Hollywood, specifically. If you're not already down
here, the idea may take some getting used to. We can tell you this: three
of us came down here from San Francisco just for this opportunity, and so
far it's been everything promised: beautiful weather, great food, and
nightlife that actually stays up at night. And, believe it or not, none of
us spend more than 15 minutes commuting to work.  (Sorry, no
telecommuters.)


Am I The One?
--------------------------------------------------

Only time and scrutiny will tell.  Start by sending your resume to
resumes-incircle-20080828@alanb.com

Be sure to tell us if you possess the following:

    * experience with Ruby, Python, or Perl
    * HTML and Javascript skills
    * knowledge of database design with hands-on MySQL
    * a solid grasp of OO concepts; design patterns a plus
    * a history of building large, scalable web applications
    * CS background (required; MS a plus) 

Along with confidence in the technical capabilities above, you should
express pride in your work and exhibit an enterprising streak. If you fit
the description, we'll get you over here to talk with us and have a look
around.

Required skills: Perl, Mysql, HTML, Linux.

Desired skills: Ruby on Rails.
