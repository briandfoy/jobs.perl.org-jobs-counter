Job title:
Needed: Perl tool to create 301 Redirect / .htaccess

Company name: Craig Law, PLLC

Internal ID: Site Move

Location: United States, Kentucky, Louisville

Pay rate: RFP

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: As Needed

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Craig Law, PLLC has a commercial bankruptcy website (written in static
HTML) that we are shutting down, in favor of a more professional legal
website.

In order to move the site and keep current search engine rankings, we need
a tool (and technical expertise) to spider the current site, map existing
pages to the new pages, and create the .htaccess or rewrite rules necessary
to map the old pages to the new (per Google Webmaster recommendations)

We are looking for both the tool (so we can use it on other sites later),
and someone to do the migration work - setting up the 301 redirects, as
well as basic instructions so that I can learn to perform other migrations
in the future.

ssh is enabled (jailshell) on the virtual server, and Perl 5.8 is
installed. .htaccess files are parsed, we do not have access to httpd.conf
(as we are running a virtual server)


Required skills:
Perl, linux command line, Apache, 301 redirects .htaccess httpd.conf,
familiarity with Google recommendations on "moving" a site, passable
written English

Desired skills: Excellent written English
