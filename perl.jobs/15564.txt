Location: Pittsburgh, PA

Pay rate: Market

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Have an interest in applying your working knowledge of Perl?

Do you want
to work for a company that is a long term supporter of the Perl community?

Want to be part of a collaborative development team and still be able to
live where you want?

Perhaps Grant Street Group is the right place for
you!

We are a growth-oriented privately held software development company
that supports a variety of clients in specialized financial transactions.
Our hosted Software as a Service (SaaS) applications support tax
collection, electronic payments, bond auctions and more. We are looking for
a talented Perl developer who wants to learn the business needs of our
clients, make a difference in the automation of business processes, and who
loves writing great code.

What competencies could help qualify you for
this opportunity?

Demonstrated ability to write strong Perl code.

Capability to translate specifications into working applications.

Willingness to use collaborative technologies in a team environment.

Understanding how software development projects are managed.

Candidates
must be able to demonstrate their ability to use Perl in a series of test
cases and be able to explain how they have used Perl in their careers. The
capability to be a positive collaborator and contributor to a team based
success model is essential.

We are based in Pittsburgh and have clients
throughout the country, including a significant presence in Florida and on
both coasts. Our professionals live throughout the United States so there
is no need to relocate. More than 80% of our developers telecommute so an
understanding of how to engage others using supportive technologies and
either experience with or willingness to learn how to be a remote
contributor is required. (You can live anywhere in the United States!)

Our
extraordinary company culture is the foundation of our unmatched customer
service -- just ask our clients!  We reward teamwork, professional
excellence, and individual responsibility.  Using the best collaboration
tools available, we offer a technology-rich work environment that makes it
possible for us to support on-site and telecommuting positions tailored to
the needs of our employees.  If you are passionate about your work, you
have entrepreneurial spirit and you want to be on a team of exceptional
professionals, Grant Street is for you.
