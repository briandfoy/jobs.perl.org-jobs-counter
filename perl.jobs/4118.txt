Job title:
Software Engineer, Content Management Tools and Operations

Company name: Groove Mobile

Internal ID: CME

Location: United States, MA, Andover

Pay rate: DOE but ~90K USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Groove Mobile's Mobile Music service enables full-length music downloads
directly to the handset over-the-air on today's mobile networks. Groove
Mobile provides the mobile music download service to large carriers such as
Sprint/Nextel (US), Orange UK, Telenor (Norway), T-Mobile Hungary and
SingTel (Singapore).

Groove Mobile is currently seeking a Software Engineer to be responsible
for the design and development of the company’s content management tools
and to oversee technical content operations. As the world's leading mobile
music service, Groove Mobile is managing a rapidly growing content catalog,
currently at over one million music tracks. If you want to be challenged by
working in a small, aggressive, fast-paced, start-up software development
team where you can have an impact in many areas then this might be the job
for you.

To be a good fit for our team, you need to be an excellent communicator,
written and orally. You need to like working with others but you still must
be someone who can work independently and take initiative to solve problems
on their own. To succeed at Groove Mobile, you must have the ability to
focus on several tasks at once, juggling priorities as needed, and you need
to be able to identify functionality versus schedule tradeoffs under
pressure.

Telecommuting a day or two per week may work out if you're in the Boston
area but not near Andover.

Required skills:
* Strong, deep experience with Perl and shell scripting. 
* Strong analytical and problem solving skills, multitasking, attention to
detail
* Experience creating highly automated technical processes
* Experience with SQL (we use MySQL) and database schema design. 
* Proficiency with Unix/Linux operating systems
* Good verbal and written communication skills
* You should have a BS in computer science or equivalent experience. For
you to be good at all of this, you've probably been at it for about 5
years.


Desired skills:
* Java knowledge a plus (no religious wars about language choice please)
* Database optimization expertise a plus.
* Localization and internationalization experience desired
* Web programming experience desired (HTML, PHP, scripting)
