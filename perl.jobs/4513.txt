Description:
Are you a software engineer who loves working directly with customers to

50% Product development

    * Working with customers and product engineering to design, code, and

appliances
    * Research and Development on new technologies and customer requests

You'd be great at this job because:

    * You thrill at making customers swoon with excellently executed and
personable interaction - including throwing on your cape periodically to
find a quick fix for a critical problem.
    * Your excellent written communication skills help keep everyone on the
same page during the quick-paced field engineering projects
    * You love being presented with tough, high-impact problems and finding
creative, clever solutions
    * You are fluent in geek-speak and normal language and translate
between them to help the product management team and other developers
understand and prioritize based on customer needs

pitfalls during project planning
    * You excel at juggling multiple projects and planning your work to
meet tough deadlines, even in a whirlwind of changing priorities
    * You're really good at working together with a team to make sure
customers' expectations are set and met consistently


Required skills:
We're interested in engineers with the following skills:

    * 5+ years programming experience
    * 3+ years web application development

familiarity with Perl, *nix, and Internet technologies

    * experience developing in a variety of programming languages and
environments

We'll give bonus points to applicants with a good deal of experience with

You want to work here because:

    * You have at least one blog and would love to work with a bunch of
Internet rock stars to help shape the next evolutionary stage of social
software.
    * You think it's really cool to work for a very distributed company -
most of our employees work remotely and on very flexible schedules.
    * Helping people communicate more effectively and efficiently fires you
up.
