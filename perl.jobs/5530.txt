Job title:
Perl Developer for web site security company

Company name: AlertSite

Location: United States, FL, Coconut Creek

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Are you looking for an opportunity to show how your skills can make things
happen every day?  A company where you won't be lost in the crowd?  You've
come to the right place.

AlertSite is a leading provider of web performance measurement, systems
monitoring and security vulnerability scanning products that ensure a
customer's critical web-based services are always available and running at
peak performance. AlertSite's range of hosted Internet services benefit all
types and sizes of businesses and organizations. Founded in 1998, AlertSite
is based in Coconut Creek, FL, and offers an exciting fast-paced
environment with many challenging projects. We are large enough to provide
a stable work environment, yet small enough to present many opportunities
for growth and advancement. 

We are currently seeking a Software Developer with at least five years
experience coding with Perl. We are looking for someone who understands
that Perl is a very serious, high-level programming language used in large,
complex, high-performance applications, and not just a "scripting tool." We
love Perl and so should you. Experience with Windows will not be held
against you, but development is performed exclusively on Linux. You should
be at home on Linux, BSD, or Unix variants. 

Required skills:
Requirements: 
3+ years programming in Perl in a Linux environment 
SQL experience (we use MySQL) 
HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, CGI and web development experience 
Full project life cycle experience 
Strong written and verbal communication skills 
Highly motivated, able to work both in a team and solo 
Must be able to meet deadlines and work well under pressure 
Strong attention to detail 
Strong communication skills and a passion for doing great work
