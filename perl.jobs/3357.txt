Job title:
mod_perl/DBI programmer for interactive media company required

Company name: Ymogen Limited

Internal ID: Perl003

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £30 PA

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Ongoing

Onsite: yes

Description:
You will be responsible for the ongoing development of the Ymogen platform.
 Ymogen manages web/mobile interactivity for media companies.  We are
undertaking a major refactoring of the code base which will include
migration to Class DBI, development of a role based security model,  use of
Catalyst or Ruby (still thinking on this one) and overhauling the look and
feel.

We have two Russian Perl developers who you will manage.
You will need to be engaged with the business and attend sales meetings
(which are 99% in London) to stay on top of the road map and development
path and be able to delegate.

You will not be a hacker - we're an ASP platform and one bug screws with
all of our clients.

Required skills:
Perl and OO techniques.
Postgres || Oracle || MySql
Knowledge of Apache and development of web applications
JS
HTML
XML

Desired skills:
Linux sysadministration including:
Apache Web server,
