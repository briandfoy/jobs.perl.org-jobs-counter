Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for an experienced Perl web application developer for a full
time, regular position.  We are a fun, small-to-medium sized company that's
been around for over 7 years, and we're growing (and growing and growing
and growing)! We're looking for the right person to join our all-star team
of developers.

We're looking for someone that lives and breaths Perl, and prefers Perl as
their language of choice.  Experience with developing and maintaining a
large web-based Perl application is a must.

You'll be working on our main platform, adding and extending functionality
to the core system, as well as creating custom changes for some of our
client's specific requirements.  You'll also be implementing service for
new clients as they sign on.

You will be called upon to write Requirements Docs, Technical Specs,
Implementation Notes, etc.  You'll need to document code you write.

Our company is a fun, fast-paced, casual environment, in a beautiful office
building in North Scottsdale.  Are you the next to join the family?

Required skills:
* Perl. Duh.  Do you live and breath it? Is Perl the One True Language(tm)?

* Web-based applications - This is crucial! Our platform is web-based
* Object Oriented Design and Programming
* The ability to design solutions and solve problems
* MySQL knowledge and general SQL know-how
* Linux - You don't need to be a SysAdmin, but you will need to be able to
set up your own development sandbox, and work with cvs.  You must have at
least 3 commits to the 2.6 kernel.  Kidding.
* Communication skills, written and verbal, are essential


Desired skills:
* mod_perl
* Apache - The basics of running it
* Ability to effectively taunt our one developer that prefers PHP
* Java
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Subversion
