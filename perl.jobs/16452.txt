Job title:
Perl Developer - Join A Small Team Building Big Things

Company name: ClickMagick

Location: Austin, Texas

Pay rate: Competitive Pay / Possible Profit Sharing

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Here at ClickMagick we're a small team building big things, and we're
looking for another amazing Perl Developer to join our team.

Our SaaS
application is used by thousands of businesses to track, test and optimize
their online marketing. And as part of the core development team you'll
help us to build great new features, you'll help refactor old legacy code,
and everything else in between.

Everything you do will be super important,
you'll directly help improve the lives and businesses of our customers, and
you'll have the opportunity to participate in the growth of the business as
we take things to the next level.

If you're just looking for a job and a
paycheck, this is not for you.

We're looking for someone who, once we both
determine we're a great fit, is willing and excited about making a
commitment to joining our team and riding the wave with us for at least the
next few years.

This is a full-time remote position.

Desired skills:
* Strong perl skills, both legacy cgis and more modern perl
* Intermediate
or better experience with javascript/jquery
* We use mysql, so you should
know how to write basic queries

THIS IS 99% A PERL DEV POSITION, BUT YOU
WILL ALSO BE PART OF OUR ON-CALL ROTATION AND MUST HAVE AT LEAST BASIC
LINUX SYSADMIN EXPERIENCE.

We have a relatively flat LAMP stack running
CentOS 7 that is VERY stable, and you'll rarely hear from PagerDuty, but
you will be on call after hours every third week.

We're happy to train you
"on the job" but you should know your way around the command line and be
comfortable with being on call to respond to after hours issues that may
involve things like restarting a service or troubleshooting a network
issue.
