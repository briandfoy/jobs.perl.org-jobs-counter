Job title: Perl developers, telecommute, open-source

Company name: Freeside Internet Services, Inc.

Location:
Truckee, CA, United States (Telecommute - Social Security # or Tax ID)

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
.
Hi,

We're Freeside Internet Services, a small software company.  We
write and support an open-source billing and operations application for
ISPs/WISPs and VoIP providers.

We're looking for some additional
developers to work on the application with us.	The work consists of
designing and implementing new features both small and large, as well as
maintaining the code, incremental refactoring, documentation and providing
assistance to our support folks.

We're a small, distributed company.  Our
employees and contractors work remotely.  We're looking for folks who are
comfortable working independently, and who can be a responsible and
communicative part of our team.

NOTE that although the position is
telecommute, we are a small company and you need to be legal to work in the
US (social security # or Tax ID/EIN).

We value working code, work/life
balance, communication and independence.  We try to keep our developers'
lives as free as possible of things like meetings, over-process, and other
obstacles to getting stuff done.  

Please don't just a copy of your
resume.  Please take the time to check out our website and code, so we can
have a useful conversation about whether there is a good fit.

I'm also
specifically looking for a CPAN ID, github URL or other code examples. 
Please do not apply without code samples -- we need to see your code in
order to consider you.

Thanks for your interest!

Ivan Kohler, President
and Head Geek
