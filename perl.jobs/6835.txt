Job title: Expert Perl/Mason Developer

Company name: iGuard / Quintiles

Location: United States, NJ, Princeton

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
iGuard is a well funded startup currently in beta testing - with a wishlist
of function refinements and codebase tightening planned for the next 12
months.

We're looking for a "hack" contract-to-perm perl developer to design,
develop, test and deploy new components and features for our website -
someone who can cut through problems quickly and turn around working
prototype code in record time... And ideally someone interested in being
part of a small but dynamic team. 

We're in a highly iterative stage of development and need people who are
confident that they can dive in, swim and deliver... If you're up for the
challenge, we need you!


Required skills:
- Guru Level Perl/DBI (i.e. in your sleep)
- Expert Mysql/HTML::Mason/Apache
- Solid Linux/Ubuntu 

Desired skills:
- Experience working in a live production environment
- Ability to create scalable and modular code
- Ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly
- Ability to work in a team programming environment or autonomously (as
needed)
