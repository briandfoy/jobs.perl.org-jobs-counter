Description:
The Perl Hunter has landed 2 choice leads in Silver Spring, MD. My

their website. Both jobs are full time, salaried and onsite (with
minimal travel). The senior job has a pay range from $90-105k and the

need any hand-holding. One task will be guiding the junior developer so
some management skills are needed. This is a small shop so a broad skill
set is most valuable. These requirements are for the senior position. If
you have some of them but not all, then apply for the junior slot.

Required skills:
* Solid Perl, mod_perl, CPAN

Desired skills:
