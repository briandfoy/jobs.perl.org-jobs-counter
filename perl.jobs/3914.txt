Job title: Superior with Perl? (SF Bay Area ONLY)

Company name: PrideStaff

Internal ID: GH-Perl

Location: United States, CA, San Jose

Pay rate: $45 to $55 USD on W2

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: Contract to Hire

Hours: Full time

Description:
Hello Perl-folk!
 
I have posted here with job, rate, working with recruiters and resume
advise.
 
Now I need your help with a great opportunity!
 
My main client has urgent need for two Perl oriented software engineers.
 
You will be developing apps to be deployed in distributed systems at
customer locations. These apps take LOTS of streamed  video and audio and
and blend it with locally stored media for unique display, both static and
some interactive.

They employ an Agile style, high iterative software development
methodology, so you need to be comfortable developing without nailed down
complete requirements. 

This is an empowered development team with leads and engineers providing
most of the architecture as well as development of the product/service. 

The Manager intends to hire these engineers full time, provided they work
out well, of course.
 
Term: 3 to 6 months or to full time (usually between 2 and 3 months).

Contract Pay Rate: (W2 only) 40 to 50 per hour, possibly a touch more.

Salary Range (if hired): $85 to $105k, possibly a little higher for the
more Sr. engineer.
 
If you have strong lead capabilities add $10/hr to the pay range and $10k
to the salary range.
 
Relocation is possible, but you would have to get yourself to San Francisco
for the face to face interview, so effectively this is for Bay Area local
candidates. Company is walking distance from Cal Train and BART.
 
W2 US work authorized candidates only. NO 3rd Party situations.


Required skills:
Superior Perl 5 skills

5 years+ software development experience.

Must have excellent overall structured software development in a
professional team setting (they have a pretty sophisticated SCCS and Source
repository). 

Desired skills:
Plusses:
LAMP
C++ 
Sockets
Experience with distributed applications
Open Source contributor (your work is documented in a project)
