Job title: Sr. User Interface Engineer

Company name: AVOXI

Location: Charleston, SC

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
AVOXI is seeking an experienced Senior User Interface Engineer to join our
global team.
 
Balancing carrier-grade reliability without sacrificing speed to market is
a constant give and take. As a platform, our customers’ businesses depend
on our reliability. We strive to achieve 100% availability with zero
customer impact by designing software and processes to ensure our
deployments have no regressions, scale reliably, and are monitored so that
we detect problems before our customers. 
 
Successful candidates will be strong full-stack developers with experience
in creating user-facing features, maintaining large code bases, and
engineering features with high scalability, security, and reliability.
 
AVOXI encourages employees to bring their unique selves to work, have fun,
discover, invent, innovate, simplify, build, and get stuff done. Your
personality and willingness to embrace our culture is as equally important
as your skills and resume. We are passionate about what we do and expect
the same from you.

Required skills:
Write quality, maintainable, and documented code in Perl, Javascript, HTML,
and CSS in a fast-paced professional software engineering environment (i.e.
source control, staged releases and deployment, peer review, continuous
integration, agile planning, etc.).

Work directly with product management to define, architect, and build new
features or modify existing ones.

Occasional travel.

Desired skills:
At AVOXI, we don’t believe in throwing code over the wall to operations or
testing code in production. We place a high premium on people with a deep
commitment to quality and a demonstrated understanding of underlying
technologies. To apply for this position you should have most, if not all,
of the following:

A Bachelors degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, or
equivalent experience.

5+ years of experience with Perl, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, HTML, and CSS.

Previous role(s) developing cross browser front-end user interfaces.

Experience with traditional relational databases such as MySQL, Postgres,
etc..

Solid knowledge of unit and integration testing methodologies, and the
ability to write, debug, and deploy testing frameworks.

Detailed planning, organization, time management, and project management
skills.

Exceptional written, verbal, and interpersonal communication skills.

Hands on, persistent, and passionate attitude about making software that is
elegant, effective, and simple.
