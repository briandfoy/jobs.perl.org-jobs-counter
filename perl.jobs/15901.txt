Job title:
Perl Developer who wants to learn Scala and NodeJS - West London

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Very Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Love Perl but want to skill-up on another stack at your employer’s expense?
Client is a major and dynamics UK company with a large (and pretty Modern)
Perl codebase who have started extended their technical stack to include
Scala and NodeJS.

Looking to replace a much-loved colleague who’s off to
The Land Down Under after a good innings, you’ll be filling big shoes in a
cross-functional team who take Agile and Scrum seriously.

You’ll be able
to leverage your already very strong Perl skills extending and building new
services in Perl, Scala, and NodeJS as appropriate. You’ll be expected to
bring a good head for service design and software architecture to bear
across all platforms, while getting up to speed with the alternative
software stacks.
