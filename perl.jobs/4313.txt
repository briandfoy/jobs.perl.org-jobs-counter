Location: Any

Pay rate: $75 per script

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Description:

We have an immediate need to generate Perl scripts which can turn our
targeted sites into valid RSS feeds.  We will specifiy the site (and
sub-navigation to a specific page if necessary) and the script must turn
the identified page into a valid RSS 2.0 feed.	This is an off-site
contracing opportunity so the work can be performed from anywhere. 
Completion of the script is verified by testing the output against our RSS
parser.

We have an inventory of 300 sites currently and it is growing every day.


Required skills: Perl, HTML, RSS
