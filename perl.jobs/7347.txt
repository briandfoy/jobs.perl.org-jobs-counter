Job title: Software Development, Consumer Website

Company name: IMDb.com

Location: 98144, WA, Seattle

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IMDb is seeking a senior software developer for our consumer website team.
We offer a small company environment with the benefits of working at a
large company (IMDb is part of Amazon.com, but run separately).  We have a
stable and successful business model.

All software positions require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer
science with three plus years of industry programming experience. Our
primary development language is Perl in the Linux/Unix environment, so a
solid base of skills
in OO Perl,a working knowledge of database skills (SQL, basic
MySQL/Postgres/db admin) and core Apache skills are required.

Our consumer website team is responsible for the customer facing website
associated with imdb.com.  The consumer website is what pretty much
everyone thinks of when we say "IMDb.com" - we also run a successful
http://pro.imdb.com for
 industry professionals.  Being on the consumer website team means that you
enjoy and thrive in a jack-of-all-trades atmosphere - you may be called
upon to work
 on video applications, templating, db tuning, DHTML, javascript - perhaps
in th
e same week!  While we are seeking the core skill sets above, a specialty
area t
hat complements our team will be a key hiring decision, so if you're a
virtuoso
in a some area that you think would interest IMDb, please let us know!


Required skills: OO Perl, Apache, Unix/Linux

Desired skills:
One or more: video, DHTML, Flash, Javascript, Mason
