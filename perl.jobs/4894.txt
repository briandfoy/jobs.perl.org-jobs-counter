Job title: Experienced Software Developer Required

Company name: OpenCrypt.com (ionix Limited)

Location: United Kingdom, Suffolk, Woodbridge

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are in search of an experienced Perl developer to continue development
of our user management and web site security software. The software
currently stands at 2.5 million characters so there's plenty to learn
before getting started. We require a Perl developer with a minimum of three
years experience, and advanced knowledge of HTML, MySQL and the Apache
.htaccess Authentication system. Experience developing other commercially
distributed products is desirable as well as knowledge of eCommerce
integration. A successful applicant must be fluent in English.

Required skills:
Work will include development of the current system and general
maintenance. You will be responsible for the development and progression of
the project. Additionally, we receive a number of custom software requests
and are happy to pass these projects on at a low commission. We are a UK
based company, though we are currently operating from the US. You will be
expected to work from your own location and be available for at least 8
hours per day. Bonuses are regularly offered to competent, efficient and
productive employees. Serious applicants only. Please give examples of past
work and an indication of your desired salary or hourly rate.
