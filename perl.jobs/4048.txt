must have worked in a Unix/Linux environment. The application that the
candidate will be supporting is a billing application.

 

The biggest factor is going to be the 'attitude' of the person. The manager

this person will be working in a production support/operations environment
(bug fixes, on call etc). This person will have to be available from 6:30
