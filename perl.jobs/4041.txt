Job title: C++/Perl Interface Expert

Location: Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: ~1 month

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hi,
I need to interface a C++ API to PERL very quickly (customer requirement)
but I have no one with any experience in PERL yet alone in building C to
Perl Intefaces. There are approximately 8 classes and 50 methods. There is
one class (and a few derivations of it) that uses virtual methods and
callbacks and Perl interface would need a mirror class that can have these
callback methods overridden.
I've read the Perl manuals and it all looks possible but I've only 3 weeks
to provide a working documented API (maybe 80% of functions) and fear the
learning curve may get us.

So I'm looking for somebody who would like a 1 month contract starting in
next few days. If you're interested please let me know together with
experience and rates.

The work has to be done on site and we will cover expenses.

Hope to hear from someone soon.

Yours Sincerely,
Colin Hercus


Required skills:
Experience with building C++/Perl interfaces including callbacks.
Experienced with SWIG. Linux and Windows
