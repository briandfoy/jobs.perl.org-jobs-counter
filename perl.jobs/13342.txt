Job title: API developer (Mojolicious)

Company name: BetterServers, Inc.

Location: Provo, Utah

Pay rate: $90k+

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We've got a beautiful little API to provision and manage an entire
(virtual) data center and all of its resources (think CloudStack, but more
RESTful). It's 100% Perl (we use Mojolicious for our web framework). We
need help to maintain, extend, and come up with even better ways of
managing this API, including scaling, hardening, and testing.

We've used mainly TDD to this point, the entire API is fully documented
(using a mishmash of POD, JSON, and Mojo templates). This is a quality Perl
development site! We're not interested in 90's Perl--you must be familiar
and happy with modern Perl (perhaps you can teach us a few things).

Required skills:
- modern Perl
- proficient written English
- experience with advanced algorithms and data structures

Desired skills:
- enjoys test-driven development
- previous Mojolicious, Catalyst, or Dancer experience
- event programming (AnyEvent, POE, etc.)
- some table tennis and/or foosball skills
