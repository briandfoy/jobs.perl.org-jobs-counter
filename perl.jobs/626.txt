Description:
We're looking for a smart, flexible generalist with specific experience in
designing and working with directories (LDAP in general, replication,

knowledge of Perl for interacting with directory services and porting and
analyzing data is essential.

The work: From high-level presentation and strategy to hands-on
implementation and problem solving.  We're a small but growing team, so you

of the self-sufficient, patient IM expert.

Required skills:
Perl, of course.
LDAP and directory fundamentals.
Some combination of iPlanet DS, Secureway/IBM DS, openldap
Good general networking knowledge - TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP(S), DNS.
A foundation in 2000/NT4 and at least one UNIX-like operating system.
_Very_ strong writing ability in English.

Desired skills:
Metadirectory (any).
Perl CGI; Net::LDAP; Mozilla LDAP.  Perhaps ADSI.
SiteMinder, Oblix, et al.
High-availability and load-balancing solutions.
Development with Java (JNDI), C(++), and other languages would be a plus,
and/or application-server experience.
Presentation skills.
