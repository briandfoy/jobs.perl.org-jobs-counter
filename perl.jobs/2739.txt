Job title: Intern at financial skunkworks

Internal ID: 1

Location: United States, ca, san francisco

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: Summer

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are a small research group attached to an established hedge fund with
over 40 years in business, and we have a summer internship opportunity for
a talented hacker in our San Francisco office.

We are not interested in risk models, option yield curves, or other "quant"
techniques. We are interested in software tools that acknowledge predicting
the future is hard, and that augment, rather than try to supplant, human
intelligence.

(A simple example: more and more businesses are 'transparent' -- you can
actually monitor their revenue in real time rather than wait until they
release their quarterly results. Our lab developed a 'bot which allowed us
to spot changes in auction-site revenue well before other investors.)

It will be part of your job to come up with the next applications to work
on, but some things we've been working on include applying data mining to
online auctions to monitor consumer demand, using hidden Markov models to
infer stock liquidity, and performing text analysis on corporate filings
for fine-grained industry classification. We develop and prototype in a
pragmatic mix of Perl, PHP, C++ and Java.

You should be intimately familiar with web development, Linux and WinXP.
You should believe that running code speaks louder than design documents
and that attracting a user base speaks loudest of all. 

We're a small group so you can't be afraid of getting your hands dirty. If
a new server arrives, you know how to install Linux and rack mount the box.
If the air conditioner starts leaking, you head to the roof with duct tape.


We offer competitive salaries, an informal environment, and interesting
problems to solve. 

If you would like to become a member of our team, please send information
about yourself to sfskunkworks@gmail.com. We receive many responses from
robots and auto-responders, so please distinguish your Subject: line with a
very small Perl program, the value of e, or something along these lines. 

Required skills: Perl, PHP, HTML ...

Desired skills: SQL, Matlab, Java ...
