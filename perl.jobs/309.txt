From: autarch@urth.org (Dave Rolsky)

Ah, the irony.  When I first worked on the jobs site with Ask, it was
because I was unemployed and looking for a job.  The site went live after
I found one.

Now, 9 months or so later, it is time once again for me to seek
employment.  I am an expert with Perl, particularly mod_perl and Mason.
My resume is available online at http://www.urth.org/resume/.  I am
interested in contract or permanent employment.

Obviously, I don't want to paid in stock ;)

Please contact me if you're interested.

Thanks,

-dave
