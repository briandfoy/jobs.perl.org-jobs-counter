Company name: RS Hughes Co

Location: Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:

- JIRA Agile
Confluence

We are not expecting a 9
out of 10 with all of these, but we use then all, and they should provide
you with a feel for the environment. We prefer to use open source solutions
whenever possible, whatever is best, most efficient. We have aggressive
plans and we are looking for someone that has ideas and can contribute to
the discussion, but also knows when it is necessary to buckle down and do
what needs to be done. Knowledge of time-saving rapid-development front-end
frameworks, and Perl, is key.

R.S. Hughes Co is the largest 3M products
distributor in the US and Mexico, with over 50 stocking warehouses. We
offer companies the best services in the industry for their factory floor
supplies, allowing customers to purchase by web, phone, over the counter,
or automatically using one of our proprietary web Purchasing and Supply
Solutions. We are a stable growing company (60 years) with a nimble
technical team, located in the heart of ski country. It is said we are a
bit laid back, but no, you can't bring your dog to work, cut your hair in
the lunch room, or show up in a T-Shirt. You can wear those on weekends.

Speaking of weekends, we don't work on those. Four-year degree required,
and it can be in French History if you are a damn good Software Engineer. 
Full benefits, and you get to work with other great people.
