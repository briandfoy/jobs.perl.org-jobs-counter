Subject: Perl coder (Work from home)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: adam@recruitomatic.com ("Adam Erickson")

We're looking for an experienced perl programmer to add to our team.

We build very dynamic ASP-like systems written completely in Perl.  We're
looking for someone to assist in supporting the software and performing
general software installation tasks.

Required skills:
Perl (in a mission critical environment)
Excellent written / oral communication skills
Familiarity with Linux (you don't need to be a sys admin)

Pluses:
MySQL integration (including database design)
Mod Perl development
Apache Server administration
Network programming in a clustered environment over TCP/IP

Please send your resume to adam@recruitomatic.com

Work from your home, or someone else's home, we don't care.

Not a head-hunter...

Thank you for your time,
Adam Erickson
