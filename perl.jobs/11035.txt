the Fortune 500.  Our client base uses our integrated hardened appliance
based software for business continuity, availability and compliance.

Supporting virtualization, consolidation and cloud computing

The Product:

NetMRI focuses on innovative ways to deliver network configuration and
change management to the enterprise.  The user experience is a highly
interactive Rich Internet Application implemented with JavaScript/JSON,
Flash, Flex and HTML. The server side is Linux / MySQL with a Ruby on Rails
framework served up by Apache / Passenger. The backend consists of numerous
Perl-based engines that collect, model and analyze network data and
automate network operations. The development methodology centers around
Agile Scrum, using lightweight processes focused on delivering tangible
results quickly and often.

The Challenge:

We are looking to bring on a highly technical manager to help augment our
growth.  Culturally, this person should have a track record of leading
teams in a highly collaborative style.	You need to have a "when in doubt,
communicate" style of management.  You should be technical enough AND
interested enough to learn what your team is doing to drive your learning
curve.	In short, you should be an engineer who LIKES to manage. 

Key Responsibilities:

* Manage and mentor a team of software engineers (both domestic and
offshore)
* Own all aspects of team deliverables (e.g. requirements analysis, task
break down and estimation, projects execution, risk mitigation and quality)

* Provide design guidance and flush out bad design
* Drive initiatives to improve quality of software, monitor quality of
deliverables and work with QA team to define effective test plans and
develop test standards for product development lifecycle
* Lead and build a team that will push the boundaries of what is possible
to create better experiences for the customer base
* Project managing and executing current releases according to schedule as
well as defining future projects

Required skills:

* 10 or more years of software development experience with at least 2 of
those years managing a	team of software developers developing in any of
the following languages - Perl, C++, Java, Python
* Full software development life-cycle experience (prefer product
experience, but at a minimum experience leading a team of developers
building software on a release schedule)
* Strong background in products built in a Linux environment
* Demonstrated ability to build, challenge and retain strong development
teams as well as a track record of leading those teams to high degrees of
achievement
* 4 year degree with technical major (e.g. CS, EE, CE, etc)
* You must be an Engineering Manager that is comfortable with Project
Management (not vice versa)


* The ability to code, when practical (anywhere from 0-20% of your time
depending on need)

Desired skills:

leading teams that build products that are network-centric
