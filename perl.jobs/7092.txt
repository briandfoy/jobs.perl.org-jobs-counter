Job title: Software Development Lead, Advertising

Company name: IMDb.com

Location: 98144, WA, Seattle

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IMDb is seeking a senior software developer team lead for our advertising
team. We offer a small company environment with the benefits of working at
a large
company (IMDb is part of Amazon.com, but run separately).  We have a stable
and
successful business model.

All software positions require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer
science with three plus years of industry programming experience. Our
primary development language is Perl in the Linux/Unix environment, so a
solid base of skills
in OO Perl,a working knowledge of database skills (SQL, basic
MySQL/Postgres/db admin) and core Apache skills are required.

Our advertising subteam is responsible for the development and enhancement
of
our advertising technology products within IMDb. This is a chance to dive
deep
into the fundamentals of internet advertising technologies, almost
certainly the
 most successful area of internet businesses to date. Background or skills
in cu
rrent advertising software architecture is helpful but not required.

Please note that this role is a team lead which means that skills &
interest
in management of a small number senior software developers is required, as
well as hands on development skills.  You can expect that about 25%-50% of
your
time will be spent management, and the remainder in hands-on development.
This
could be a great transition role for someone who is interest in growing
their
management skills.


Required skills:
OO Perl, Apache, Unix/Linux, Team Management

Desired skills:
Familiarity with advertising systems, terminology and technology.
