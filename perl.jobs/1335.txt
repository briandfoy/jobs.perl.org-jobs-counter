Description:
Peregrine Computer Consultants Corporation, has an immediate need for a

demanding, Senior Perl programming position.  

Pleasant, casual-dress environment in downtown Fairfax City with all the
Mountain Dew™ you can drink!

Pay commensurate with skills & experience.  

Required skills:
This job **requires** a candidate who can hit the ground running and is
extremely well-versed with Linux, Apache, mySQL & Perl (LAMP) for web CGI
programming.

Potential candidates *must* have legal US work status and interviews will
begin immediately with placement as soon as possible.

Applicants should have well-honed oral and written communication skills as
well as significant experience with a majority of the following:

Perl (augmentation/modification of existing base code and new development
in like style)

Linux (primarily RedHat distribution with heavy modifications)

Standard protocols such as LWP, SSH, FTP, etc.

MySQL (Administration and standard SQL)

Desired skills:
Our quote is "Programming is a state of mind, not a language", therefore
the ability to apply what you know and learn other programs, modules, etc.

needs are diverse so the ability to react quickly to their requests is
important. 

You must be able to work with minimal supervision and drive projects to
100% completion with significant polish.

Our truly ideal candidate would be a deal-closer with the ability to bring
and finalize sales leads.  Significant sales bonuses are involved.
