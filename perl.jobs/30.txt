Greetings potential employers!

    I am a perl hacker located in Denver, Colorado.  I am in mid-career
and have several years worth of experience.

You can view my resume at 
http://tillenbell.faeriemud.org/phaedrus_resume.html
You can also see some of my code on cvs.faeriemud.org, the project WebMVC
is still under construction, but shows some of my skill.

Anyway, I'm mostly looking for work in Colorado, but I would consider a
position in another state (or even country) if the opportunity was well
suited to me.
