Job title: Seeking Experienced Perl Developer

Company name: Pelican Parts

Location: Harbor City, CA

Pay rate: USD $85,000-90,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Pelican Parts is the leading online source of car parts for German
automobiles including Porsche, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, Saab,
Volvo, and Mini.  We offer the most extensive and competitively priced
selection of Genuine, OEM and aftermarket parts in the industry. We also
produce and manage thousands of articles to help the DIY enthusiast with
projects for their Porsche, BMW, Mercedes Benz and Mini Cooper. Our
sponsored community is one of the largest 500 communities in the world and
these enthusiasts provide hundreds of thousands of comments across
countless topics involving your German automobile.

We currently need to fill an additional Perl Developer role to join our
talented team.	We are looking for someone exceptional and self-motivated,
and someone who is energized and readily embraces a challenge.	Our
environment here is fast-paced but casual.  You will have the opportunity
to grow with us while helping us improve our ecommerce site, various
content sites and enhance our existing tools and help us to build new ones.


Candidates with senior level development experience are preferred. 
JavaScript and SQL experience is also a must-have.  The kind of individual
we seek should have clear knowledge of developing web-based tools and apps
as well as creating automation software, system tools, and a solid
understanding of data processing and report generation.

Required skills:
- Must have at least 5-7 years direct hands-on Perl development experience.
Ability to work with existing/legacy code, work with others on team
projects as well as occasionally being the sole developer on smaller
projects.
- Must have 3+ experience with SQL, including Microsoft SQL Server and
MySQL. Your SQL experience must include forming your own queries,
understanding query efficiency, query performance evaluation and how to
maintain an optimized balance of database logic and programming code.
- Must have experience with JavaScript, including frameworks, jQuery in
particular. JavaScript knowledge must include development of on-page
interactivity, DOM manipulation, AJAX, and use of JSON. Although we are not
looking for a dedicated front-end developer in this role, solid working
experience in this area is necessary. We will not consider someone lacking
this experience.
- We are a Windows environment, you must have experience and comfort with
that.
- Ability to thoroughly unit-test your work own is required.
- A background working with ecommerce sites, B2C and customer support sites
is very important.
- Excellent communication skills.

Desired skills:
- Additional experience with other server-side scripting languages is a
plus.
- If your Perl experience includes frameworks such as Catalyst, Dancer or
Mojolicious this would be beneficial to us going into the future.
- Familiarity with object-oriented frameworks such as Moose as well as
template modules or toolkits are not critical but also a plus for our
future needs.
- Linux experience would be a plus but not necessary.
