Job title:
Catalyst/DBIC/CGI developer for contract work

Company name: A3 IT Solutions, LLC

Internal ID: tangperl

Location:
United States, North Carolina, Greensboro

Pay rate: commensurate with experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: as needed

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We're in need of a mid-level Perl developer to provide "as needed" contract
support of: a legacy CGI "intranet" application; a recently rebuilt
Catalyst application that serves about one million requests a day; and
their accompanying backend MySQL databases.

The job involves: receiving various types of change requests (bugs,
enhancements, promotion form builds, etc.); making and committing to
Subversion the necessary changes; pushing the changes through a rollout
process that involves customer verification and authorization; and finally,
a release into the production environment.

Some Linux sysadmin duties may also be required to help in the
administration of the production environment.

The position can be 100% telecommuting, however candidates local to
Greensboro, NC will have strong consideration. Initial work load estimate
is 20 to 40 hours per month.

Required skills:
We're looking for someone that has good experience with Perl and Catalyst
in a Linux web application environment. This includes at least a good
knowledge of CGI, the HTTP request life cycle, MySQL and strong knowledge
of Catalyst and DBIx::Class.

Desired skills:
An individual with experience deploying Catalyst in a  FastCGI production
environment will be strongly considered. Also, experience in a real
DEV/QA/UAT/PROD life-cycle environment including Subversion and Buzilla is
a real plus.
