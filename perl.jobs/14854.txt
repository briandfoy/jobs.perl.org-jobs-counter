Description:
Adapt A/S is expanding, so we are looking for an experienced Perl developer
to join our team of talented professionals. 

The job
We are a dynamic workplace where youâ€™ll be working with some of the best
colleagues in the industry and given the opportunity to expand your skill
set. Conversely, we expect you to contribute with your experience and
knowledge. HQ is in Copenhagen/Denmark and we have offices in Lithuania,
but our team-setup supports different work locations in Europe. If your
work location is beside Europe, send your CV anyway, we will investigate
the possibilities.   

Your role will be to work closely with our other developers, project
managers and the rest of the organisation to develop innovative perl
solutions for our customers. This involves needs analysis, solution
proposals and solution implementation. The main tasks are:

- Developing web applications on the LAMP stack 
- Sparring with key stakeholders: project managers,  
  information architects and clients

Required skills:
We expect you to have an understanding and interest in our customers'
business and to be passionate about Open Source. This combination makes you
a valuable sounding board for both developers and sales department. The
ideal candidate has:

- A few years experience with professional perl 
  development (documentation is required) 
- Professional skills in perl development and a desire	
  to learn even more
- Good knowledge of the most common protocols and 
  standards used for web development (HTTP, HTML, XML, 
  SMTP)
- Knowledge of Open Source software development 
- Minimum 2 years experience with web application 
  development
- A high level of spoken and written English

As a person you are serious, reliable and professional with a technical
overview. You thrive on deadlines and can remain calm and collected in a
busy and sometimes hectic working environment. Your work is always top
notch and you take pride in delivering code of the highest standard. Being
a team player, you are happy to help your colleagues and will do everything
you can to make sure all projects are successful.

Desired skills: Bachelor+ in a relevant field of education
