Subject: perl programmer needed in northern NJ

Hello, all:

If any of you experienced perl writers are in or near northern NJ, Sussex
county area, I have a ton of work for you

We are near the border of NY and PA. This is about as far north in NJ as you
can get, just to give you an idea of our physical location.

Music industry work environment. You will be writing scripts for data
collection,
fan clubs, member demographics collection, awards tracking, points tracking,
GUI creation for record label execs to interface with scripts for automated
updating,
maintenance of records & scripts. Many scripts to create, so little time.

Play an instrument? Relax with your guitar in the studio during breaks in
tha action.
Meet a crazy band , artist or stray cat, too.

Perl
MySQL  / Linux OS a definite plus

If interested, and you can work in our laid back office/studio..
