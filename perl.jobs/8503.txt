Description:

Community!

Fonality is a young, Intel-funded, Web 2.0 Telecommunications company based
in Los Angeles. We provide a VoIP-PBX phone system designed to outperform
brand-name, enterprise-level PBX systems for a fraction of the price. We’re
looking for creative people with world-class skills who thrive in an
energetic setting and are passionate about their lives and their work.

We are seeking Perl Developers with experience creating both backend and
web applications. Our primary product consists of a high-level, intuitive,
web-based interface to the open-source PBX software Asterisk. We've also
built various other desktop applications and APIs that interface with our
system and Asterisk. You’ll be responsible for developing, testing, and
maintaining new and existing systems written in Perl within a Linux
environment.

At Fonality, we believe in promoting from within and investing in our
employees. We offer a very competitive compensation package and a
comprehensive health insurance package (medical, dental, and vision). New
employees are eligible for stock options after one year of employment. We
offer an anti-dress code environment.

With some of the smartest people in the telephony business working for us,
this is a great opportunity to jump onboard and work with people who are
passionate about what they do.

Required skills:
• 2 - 5+ years perl or PHP experience 
• 3+ years in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. 
• 3+ years Linux experience 
• 2+ years MySQL experience


Desired skills:
Exposure to IP telephony, trixbox, or Asterisk is a plus
