Job title:
Perl Programmer, Data Team, IMDb - Database, OO, Natural Language
Processing

Company name: IMDb.com (Internet Movie Database)

Location: United Kingdom, Bristol

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
If you're a top notch programmer and a fan of movies and TV, we've got the
ideal job for you.

The Internet Movie Database is growing rapidly and our data managers need
the very best tools to deal with the huge volume of information submitted
by our users every week.

The successful applicant will need to devise and implement algorithms for
complex problems, often with limited time.  You will need to be inventive,
adding intelligence to web and command-line tools to allow data managers to
process data with greater speed and accuracy.  Projects range in size from
days to months and there are always interesting challenges to face.

You would work from home, on high-end equipment provided by IMDb, but would
need to live near Bristol to attend a weekly working (pub) lunch and other
meetings with colleagues.  (We only talk about movies *some* of the time
;-))

We have a great environment of talented people who work hard to make IMDb
the most credible media source on the planet.  All of our engineers have
the opportunity to make a big impact, and you'll find your colleagues
always immensely grateful for the work you do for them.

IMDb is owned by Amazon.com, but we operate separately and have our own
technology systems.  When you join IMDb, you become a full-fledged
Amazon.co.uk employee - which means you enjoy the cohesive work environment
of a small company while also gaining the bigger benefits of working for a
Fortune 500 company.  It's the best of both worlds.

Job Qualifications

You need to be sharp-minded and inventive: skilled at reducing complex
problems into elegant solutions.  We'll be looking for people who can show
that they are adaptable and quick to learn.  You need a 'hacker'
mentality -- able to approach any challenge and quickly start scripting a
solution -- but also a natural flair for writing organised, well-structured
code.  You also need an instinct for which approach to use when!

Our staff are distributed across the planet, so you need to be able to
function independently while also interacting efficiently with other team
members.  Working from home will place an extra burden on you to
communicate with colleagues and internal 'customers', and you will need to
be self-motivated and able to organise your own work-flow.

This position requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer science
with three plus years of industry programming experience. Our primary
development language is Perl in the Linux/Unix environment, so a solid base
of skills in OO Perl is critical.

A mix of any or all of the following skills would also count strongly in
your favour: SQL; Javascript/DHTML/AJAX; unit testing; web services.  If
you meet the core requirements and have other relevant advanced
competencies (e.g. machine intelligence, data mining, expert systems,
natural language processing etc.), then please let us know.
