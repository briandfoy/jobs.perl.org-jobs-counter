Pay rate: £40-55k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You will be joining a small but dedicated team who are given the freedom to
excel. You must be passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology
and usability. With few formal meetings, your day might cover working with
the sysadmin, helping the designers with JavaScript, integrating with the
CRM webservices or generating Google earth kml files for search results.

Recognised as the leading estate agents website in the world we want to
maintain this reputation for providing cutting edge features, without
losing simplicity and usability. We also provide solutions within the
company, be this helping production by generating InDesign formatted text,
or replacing a MS Word based brochure system with one which generates PDF
files from configurations generated through a web GUI.

Website: 600k+ visitors a month, 350k+ images live at any one time,
html/rss/kml/json

Existing systems: mass data processing / data analysis / image processing /
PDF generation

Development environment: Puppet deployment, virtualized personal servers,
iMac desktops

Required skills:
You will need to have strong communication skills (occasionally doing
internal presentations) and be someone who works well as part of a team and
enjoys sharing ideas and debating options. You will be expected to provide
input in the design of systems and can even venture an opinion on front end
design issues.

Core modules used in our systems: Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Template::Toolkit,
TheSwartz, MogileFS, Memcache, Perlbal, Plack, Test::More, Moose, PDF::API2
along with hundreds of others.

Of course you will already be used to writing tests and doing code reviews.
You are also likely to have several CPAN modules, and follow the latest
technical developments, for example Moose and Moo.
