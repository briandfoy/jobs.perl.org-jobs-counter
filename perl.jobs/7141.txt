Job title: Software Developer, Data Team

Company name: IMDb.com

Location: United Kingdom, Bristol

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) is seeking talented Software
Engineers/Architects to develop and expand our next-generation data
management systems.

We're looking for someone who loves working with the complex interactions
of large, distributed systems -- who enjoys optimising architecture for
performance and scalability and capably grapples with competing priorities
and demands. Candidates must be experienced, creative, flexible and
self-motivated, with a natural flair for designing and writing reliable,
maintainable code.

This is a telecommuting position joining our extensive team in the Bristol
area, all of whom work from home. The successful candidate *will* need to
relocate to the Bristol area to be able to attend a weekly working lunch
and other meetings with colleagues.

IMDb is the biggest, best, most award-winning movie site on the planet. It
is currently the #17 most popular site in the U.S. and #31 world-wide
(source: Alexa.com). You would be joining a growing, cutting-edge company
with excellent prospects. Our salaries are extremely competitive, and we
also offer a top-notch benefits package courtesy of our parent company,
Amazon.co.uk.

Skills required:

* Candidates should be experienced in Object Oriented Design/OOP and
distributed/enterprise architecture, and have experience working on large
systems.
* Experience of working with large database-driven applications and/or
distributed computing is highly desired.
* Candidates should have an extremely high level of competence in Perl,
Java, C++ or similar, and should be comfortable working and programming in
a UNIX/Linux environment. For candidates without intimate Perl experience,
we will be looking for evidence of adaptability, and experience in a
related language (e.g. shell-scripting, PHP, sed, awk).
* Solid communication skills and the ability to work well in a team are
critical.
* Candidates must have a strong computer science background: a bachelor's
degree or higher in computer science is required, along with a minimum of
3-5+ years of industry programming experience.
* Experience of SQL, unit testing, web services, javascript frameworks
(Prototype/Dojo etc) would count in your favour. If you meet the core
requirements and have other relevant advanced competencies (e.g. machine
intelligence, data mining, expert systems, natural language processing
etc.) then please let us know.

Applicants only: recruiters must not submit on behalf of other people
through this address. Applications not submitted by candidates themselves
are rejected.

Required skills:
Perl (or evidence of adaptability and experience in a related language),
OOP.
