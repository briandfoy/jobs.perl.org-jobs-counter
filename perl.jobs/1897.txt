Job title:
OSD Analyst: entry-level programming position with market research company

Company name: Knowledge Networks

Internal ID: 20027

Location: United States, CA, Menlo Park

Pay rate: $40,000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This posting is intended for limited experience ( < 5yrs) hires, though
others will be considered. 

Working with limited supervision, the Online Survey Development (OSD)
Analyst would be primarily responsible for working with Client Service
teams to convert questionnaires into fully functioning scripts for
web-based survey administration. Overall process includes programming,
quality checking, data handling, and project communication/coordination.
May include specialization in one or more of these areas.

Questionnaires are coded in proprietary PERL-based NQL scripting language;
survey scripts will include PERL coding, HTML and Javascript. This is _not_
a hardcore programming job. It is a dynamic web design/development role
requiring good project managment abilities.

Required skills:
Web development experience creating dynamic content. PERL, HTML. MS
Word/Excel. Excellent communication ability (in-person, email, phone),
particularly with non-technical parties. Multi-tasking, self-management and
close attention to detail. 

Desired skills:
Knowledge of SPSS/SAS a plus, as is prior experience with market research.
Javascript preferred. Experience with Excel macros, VB, Photoshop, Flash,
DHTML, Cold Fusion, ASP, or PHP will be considered. A friendly personality!
