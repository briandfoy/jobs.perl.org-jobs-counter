Description:
My client, a well established and global web / e-commerce outfit, with over
a 10 year history and a long list of exciting blue-chip brands are urgently
searching for a skilled Perl Programmer who has at least 3-4 years
experience with the language and preferably with Perl CGI. They use Oracle
databases but will consider applicants with strong MySQL or Sybase database

This is an opportunity to join a full service online agency with a strong
global presence in the US and Australia. With the breadth and depth of
their inside knowledge they are able to supply and sustain a truly
effective web presence. The successful Perl Programmer would be joining a
team of 30 in the UK and play a pivotal part in further establishing their
reputation across the globe which currently is over 60 countries. 

In addition to the strong Perl skills and database proficiencies a good
knowledge of web development and Linux or Unix operating systems. Any
previous experience with CPAN, Internet protocols, FastCGI or Subversion
would be highly beneficial from applicants. Exposure to Javascript, PHP and
XML would be advantageous but by no means essential. 

Any other experience with any of the below would also be a plus: 
• Data import/export 
• Content Management 
• Zeus Web Server (or Apache) 
• TCP/IP 
• Problem Solver 
• Catalyst (or another Perl framework) 
My client’s offices are based on the doorstep of the Thames Ditton train
station; there are direct trains from Waterloo to Thames Ditton plus easy
road access from A3/M3/M25.
