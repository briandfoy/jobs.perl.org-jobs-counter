Job title: perl programmer (email, DBI, mason)

Company name: IC Group

Location:
United States, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia

Pay rate: $45-50k US

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IC Group is a small company involved in email forwarding,
filtering, and mailing list management.

Most of our in-house code is Perl, with old Python code and some small
(bourne) shell scripts thrown in.  Our systems are mostly based around
Postfix and Apache/mod_perl, but most of the code is our own.

We need both new development and maintenance programming/refactoring of old
code, both directly customer-facing (e.g. our website, using Mason) and on
the backend, interfacing with mysql, postfix, and bits of the operating
system (which is Linux).

You must be fluent in Perl and comfortable using (preferably
administrating) and programming for unix.  Familiarity with SMTP and the
relevant RFCs is very helpful.	


Required skills:
Perl, unix, mysql (or similar DB), Mason (or similar)
