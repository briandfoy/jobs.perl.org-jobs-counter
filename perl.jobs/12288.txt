Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 4 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Plain Black (www.plainblack.com) is looking for a Perl programming, Linux
using, ssh connected, GEEK! We're not looking for your run of the mill
programmer; only geeks should apply. We want you to know and love
technology. We want you to not only have heard of operating systems other
than Windows, but to have used them. And most importantly, we want you to
be hungry to learn more every single day. If this sounds like you, continue
reading, else go back to Monster. On a day to day basis you'll be asked to
design and build new applications for WebGUI (www.webgui.org) add features
to existing applications. Sometimes you'll work independently, and
sometimes you'll work as part of a team, so you must be both self-motivated
and a good communicator. You'll work with technologies such as Perl,
Javascript, MySQL, Apache, and Linux. Be prepared to think on your feet,
plan ahead, and fly by the seat of your pants...it just depends on the day.
 This position has the chance to be a permanent position at the end of the
term.

Required skills:
Minimum Requirements 
- Be a geek. 
- Be a U.S. Citizen as we do lots of work for the Federal government. 
- Know object-oriented Perl. 
- Have experience with SQL and an RDBMS like MySQL. 
- Be familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- Have experience with operating systems other than Windows. 
- Be a great communicator. 
- Be self-motivated.

Desired skills:
- Be an AJAX and Javascript wizard. 
- Have experience with a version control system, like Subversion. 
- Apache / mod_perl experience. 
- Experience with the WebGUI API.
- Experience with IOS a bonus
