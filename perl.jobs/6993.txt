Description:
As a Sr. Software Engineer / Sr. Perl Developer based in either our Santa
Barbara or Westlake Village, CA office, you will work with some of the
greatest minds in the Perl engineering community as you develop and
optimize Perl / mod_perl code to contribute significantly to our
high-performance systems. For the software engineer who thrives on variety,
this is an ideal role that will challenge you with juggling several
projects versus focusing on a single project for months at a time. We
provide an environment that supports your insatiable appetite for learning,
so we support experiences such as sponsoring award-winning member of the
international Perl community Dr. Damian Conway (author, "Object Oriented
Perl" and "Perl Best Practices") at the YAPC. If you desire a challenge,
appreciate being recognized for your efforts and enjoy being part of a
winning team, you owe it to yourself to explore this opportunity with a
recognized leader in the online marketing space.

direct-response marketers the ability to reach over 70 percent of all
Internet users. The depth of this reach, combined with advanced targeting
and automated optimization capabilities, provides advertisers with a
variety of solutions to attain the highest return for their online
marketing campaigns. ValueClick Media also provides publishers with
powerful inventory management tools to maximize control and flexibility,
ensuring the maximum revenue and customer experience for their site. In
September 2005, the former Fastclick was acquired by ValueClick, Inc.
(Nasdaq:VCLK). ValueClick, Inc. is the single-source provider of media,
technology and related services that enable advertisers, agencies and web
site owners to reach consumers in all major online marketing channels.
ValueClick was named one of the top ten fastest growing technology
companies by Business 2.0 and we debuted at 55 out of the top 100 for the
Hot Growth Companies recognized by BusinessWeek!

Required skills:
As our Perl Developer your mission will be to manage the full lifecycle
development of projects, including developing software functional
specifications based on product requirements, writing code to accomplish
specific goals and assisting in preparing and implementing test plans with
our QA staff. You will manage multiple responsibilities which include
responding to operational requests from customers to modify or enhance
existing web-based applications, performing on-call duties for emergencies
regarding operational systems and processes, modifying or enhancing
existing web-based perl applications in accordance with provided feature
specifications, and performing preventative maintenance on existing
applications and services. Your outgoing personality, passion for continued
learning and proven Perl acumen will elevate your candidacy with our
close-knit and entrepreneurial team. Join us at ValueClick Media and let
our innovative and collaborative environment serve as a ladder for your
professional development.
