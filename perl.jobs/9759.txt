Job title: Director of Technology

Company name: Acta Wireless

Internal ID: aw2010

Location: United States, CA, San Diego

Pay rate: $ depends on experience

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are searching for a Director of Technology, a key member of our
technical staff who reports directly to our CTO. This is an ideal position
for someone who is creative, loves technology, and loves to solve problems
with software. Your key responsibilities will include:

Designing software solutions for a variety of problems. You'll work on
projects that classify unstructured data and on information retrieval
tasks, among other things.

You will manage and guide developers as they work through solutions you've
outlined for them.

You will probably write code yourself, but the amount depends on the
project and your disposition. At a minimum, you should be able to prototype
technical solutions and step wade in to fix issues as needed.

About
Who is Acta Wireless, anyway? We are a young company and embrace modern
ways of working. We're virtual, so all our employees get to work from home.
We live on Skype. To foster inter-personal relationships, we meet several
times a year in the US and Europe. We've found this makes us happier,
attracts talent from around the world, and lowers costs. 

We like building new companies and new solutions, usually with a wireless
angle. Sometimes we work with established companies; sometimes we invest in
early stage companies, and sometimes we create our own.

Required skills:
• We build many web solutions using Catalyst, so you must know it.
Similarly, you should be comfortable with OO Perl, databases (especially
MySQL), ORMs such as DBIx, etc.
• You should be productive and comfortable working with open source tools
in a Linux environment.
• You should have experience deploying and managing software in high
availability production environments.
• You should have some experience building solutions for large scale
problems (i.e., practical experience with distributed processing)
• You will work on a couple of projects at once and several projects a
year. Hopefully, you welcome this sort of variety and will even propose
your own ideas, too.

A lot of our work is outsourced, as we can leverage experts even if we
don't have full-time work for them. You should have experience:
• Managing developers in other countries and time zones
• Planning and tracking towards short-term and long-term goals,
• Writing software development specifications, 
• Performing white box acceptance testing of their deliverables


Desired skills:
• Experience with other MVCs is also great, as we're always looking for
better ways to do things
• Experience building search engines
• Creative problem solving skills, especially the ability to identify which
patterns apply to what situations, and which open source solutions might
help solve a problem
