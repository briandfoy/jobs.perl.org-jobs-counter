Job title: Debug Perl script / system

Company name: Confluence

Location: United States, DC, Washington

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: just a day or two

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a legacy system that sends email to a bunch of subscribers, written
in Perl, that used to work but stopped working a couple days ago. 

I will only entertain people who are able to look at this right away, and
provide an estimate for fixing it (# hours) in advance and work within that
estimate. It is a very small job / shouldn't take more than an hour or so.

Required skills:
Perl and perhaps basics of email sending, maybe PhP and definitely Unix /
Linux / shell scripting?
