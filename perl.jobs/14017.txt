Description:
We are constantly looking for Perl developers to work with us on our Tapper
test infrastructure ( http://tapper-testing.org ).

Joining our team you will be working on the Tapper test system to automate
testing and qualification of new hardware and the Amazon Linux
distribution. You will be testing bare metal and virtualized operating
systems and qualify them for use in the Amazon Web Services.

The job is not just about web application programming but an allround
hacking job on every granularity, from daily micro details to complex
systems. It involves hacking in other languages, evaluating data, working
with OS and virtualization experts and generally is about automating
everything for QA, large scale.

Required skills:
Advanced Perl programmer.
Advanced Shell programmer.
Experience with other languages.

Desired skills:
It helps to know some of the technology we currently use: Modern Perl,
Catalyst, Mojo, DBIx::Class, Mason, Template Toolkit, Moose, Plack, CPAN
testing technologies (TAP, Test::* modules, prove), SQL and NoSQL
databases, Perl XS, NYTProf, Amazon web services, git, and other
programming languages. Though knowing them is not mandatory since we
constantly change things.

It would be beneficial if you have experience with CPAN contributions and
you have been interacting within the Perl community.
