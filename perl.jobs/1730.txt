Job title: Perl/C++ Developers

Company name: Athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, Waltham

Pay rate: US $40-90k

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Developer
We're looking for some cool people to help us make the lives of healthcare
providers easier. 
It helps a lot if you know perl, or have a lot of confidence that you can
pick it up on a dime. RDBMS experience, especially Oracle, would also be
most excellent. 
 
The emphasis here is on results. You've got to love working with all types
of people, and then using your mad coding skillz to deliver visible,
bottom-line value. Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to
you. The development environment is friendly and open. Work-life balance is
respected and encouraged. The folks you'll be working with are all top
notch, and will probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've
ever worked with regardless of where you're coming from. 
 
The company itself is one of the brightest stars in the pre-IPO universe,
if we do say so ourselves. We've been around for about 6 years now; we were
originally backed with $47 million in venture capital from A-list VC's
(Venrock, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Cardinal Health Partners, Oak, and
Granite Global), but the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have
to raise any more capital. 
 
At this point, we're looking for a few good developers & QA test engineers
to hire immediately; salary range is $40-90K plus options and benefits,
depending on experience. The company continues to grow, so there are
significant advancement opportunities for ambitious folks. 


Required skills:
High GPA, minimum 3.5 from top schools such as Harvard, MIT, BU,
Northeastern
Experience using perl, C++, and Oracle knowledge
Evidence of taking on increasing levels of responsibility in a job in the
past.
