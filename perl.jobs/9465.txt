Description:
Are you ready to create systems to power one of the largest e-commerce
companies in the world?  Amazon.com has over 70 million customers, and
developers all over the world rely on our storage, compute, and virtualized
services via Amazon Web Services.  Our success depends on our world-class
network and hardware infrastructure; we’re handling massive scale and rapid
integration of emergent technologies. Our goal is to become “The
Infrastructure Platform” for the world.  The Infrastructure Automation team
is responsible for delivering the software that powers our infrastructure,
and we’re looking for Software Development Engineers to deliver the next
generation of Infrastructure Automation.

As a Software Development Engineer for Infrastructure Automation you’ll be
building and operating systems that enable us to drive Amazon web services,
operate Amazon infrastructure, and provide an interface for customers (both
internal and external) to consume infrastructure directly without human
intervention.  You’ll drive a step-change in Amazon’s ability to deploy,
manage and monitor network availability, routing and flows by creating
software that automates routine decisions and provides fast easy access to
data to guide all other decisions.   You’ll simplify load balancing
solutions, provide internal and external customers with great tools to
select and optimize load balancing solutions, and will automate management
of load balancing solutions.  


Required skills:
The ideal candidate will be passionate about solving the toughest software
challenges; you’ll be excited by working at huge scales, and you’ll have a
proven record of delivering highly operable and maintainable software on
time.  You’ll have relentlessly high standards for yourself and everyone
you work with; you’ll drive engineering best practices throughout your team
and you’ll be constantly looking for ways to make the systems you own
better.  You’ll be intensely customer focused: you understand your
customers’ challenges and are constantly looking for ways to solve them. 
You have great communication skills, and enjoy working in a fast-paced,
collaborative team environment. 
Your education and experience include:
•	BS degree or higher in Computer Science with 5+ years of relevant,
broad engineering experience
•	Significant experience programming in Perl
•	Experience with C++ or Java in a Linux environment
•	Familiarity with web services, virtual machines, SOAP, XML, MySQL,
LDAP, and object oriented methodologies
