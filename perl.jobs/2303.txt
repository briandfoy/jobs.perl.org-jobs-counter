Description:

We currently have two positions available within our small, but skilled
core technical team. The team is focused on the development and
maintenance  of a fast, scalable technical infrastructure that provides
an efficient, effective and reliable service to our customers in the
present and that will enable the company to grow successfully in the
years ahead. We have been running successfully, as a proof of concept
for around one year now, are currently engaged in re-engineering parts
of the the database structure and Perl code-base for greater efficiency,
and are expanding our data-centre resources, all with a view to moving
forward into full-scale commercial operation at an early date.

Our core tools are Perl (OO), some 'C', MySQL, Linux (Redhat), Apache,
sendmail and CVS.  If you have experience of the development and/or
maintenance of Internet Services (preferably, but not necessarily,
email) using most or all of these tools and feel that you can contribute
to our team then we would very much like to hear from you.

Required skills:
Perl, SQL, Sendmail (or other mail system), Linux (preferably Redhat) and
some sys admin.

Desired skills:
Must be very bright and able to work under pressure. Preferably experienced
in developing scalable systems and have good sys admin skills.
