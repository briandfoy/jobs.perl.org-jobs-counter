Description:
This is a DBA job with emphasis on enterprise and system and architectural
skills.  We are responsible for all oracle db servers and their tuning. 
All Storage arrays and their deployment and maintenance.  We have EMC and
Adaptec SATA.  All fibre SAN deployments and architecture and maintenance. 
All tape backup and their deployment and maintenance.  So as  you can see I
need a well rounded pretty experienced guy to join our dba group.  We have
everything semi-automated with Perl and some shell and some C and java.  No
real weekend or nighttime work unless there is an outage for a hardware or
software reason.  We are the SA group for all of our db servers.  We are
running Dell servers with Linux and oracle RAC in QA and in production.  We
also have a RAC set for the data warehouse. Everything is a 24 X 7
operation.
There is little or no money for relocation for this position. 

Required skills:
I need very solid baseline oracle skills and OCP would be very cool.  In
addition I need excellent Perl skills with exposure to DBI and enterprise
environments.  Some shell experience is required.  Self starting and done't
bring your  ego to work is a requirement.  Able to work harmoniously and
take responsibility and run with it is a requirement.

Desired skills:
Oracle 9i OCP DBA.
Good Perl skills.
Good programming skills.
Decent shell skills.
Enterprise skills -> Storage Arrays, Tapedecks, fibre SAN
7 X 24 experience.
