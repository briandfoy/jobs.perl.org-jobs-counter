Job title: Open Source Web Developer

Company name: mySociety Ltd

Pay rate: £38-45k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
Are you looking for smart colleagues, meaningful projects, and fresh
technology challenges? mySociety is a community of coders and technology
fiends using our talents to make the world a better place.

We do this by building useful, high impact, democratic open source web apps
like FixMyStreet.com, WhatDoTheyKnow.com and TheyWorkForYou.com, and
running projects, such as Alaveteli.org, to help people run tools like
these around the world.

We’re hiring open-source-savvy web developers in order to grow our
international impact, help us sustain ourselves through commercial work,
and increase our reach in the UK.

We are a top drawer software development team, and we get to work on stuff
that matters. Our sites and projects help people to get important things
done: holding politicians to account, extracting information from
government, and getting streetlights fixed. And as a mySociety developer
you can see the benefits and talk to the users, every day.

We’re looking for new developers who will be comfortable working on both
charitable and commercial projects, for clients who vary from volunteers
(asking for new features) through to big media company clients with high
expectations of professionalism.

We’re not dogmatic about languages: if you can work in any of Ruby, Python
or Perl you’ll be at home here - we’ll find an interesting project for you.
We love Django, Catalyst and Rails, and we’re having fun experimenting with
Node.js, canvas, and more.

We’re widely geographically dispersed, and a lot of people work from home
(although we’re setting up a central London office too). There is a high
expectation of self-direction and self-discipline; our project management
style aims to minimize pain and distraction, and leave people to get on
with doing great work. If you prefer to work in groups, that’s fine, and if
you like to plug away on your own, we’ll work to give you projects where
that suits too.

You’ll also be collaborating with some amazing volunteers who are
incredibly skilled and dedicated in their own right. Being part of
mySociety means being in the kind of organisation that is so motivated that
the management’s job is often to tell people to take it easy. We welcome
people who, deep down, burn to make a difference.

The application deadline is 9am on 21st May 2012, and interviews will be on
the 28th May 2012, in London, or via Skype if travel is problematic.

Required skills:
A broad range of front and back end experience in open source languages.
You should be able to take a project from design to execution, covering
everything in between. 

Our current main projects are in Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and node.js.

Experience in working with open source databases (such as PostgreSQL,
MySQL, MongoDB).

The ability to write clean, maintainable front end HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.

A pragmatic approach to automated testing.

You should have autonomously conceived, designed and built at least one
interactive website or app of some kind, running it for extended periods.

It would also help if you have maintained open source tools that are
re-used by others.

As a person, we hope you will be:

Friendly and motivated

Creative and lateral thinking

Keen to learn and master new developments in technology

Able to balance technical pragmatism and technical purism

Good at managing your own time and avoiding distractions

Aware and realistic about your own strengths and weakness

The sort of person who has passions beyond coding
