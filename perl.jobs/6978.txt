Description:
We are currently seeking two developers to join our rapidly expanding
technical team. 

The nature of our business is interfacing between client systems, this
includes interfaces with over 1000 websites and many desktop and

We are the undisputed leaders in our market providing a specialised high
availability web application with functionality not found elsewhere, much
of what we offer is truly ground breaking in our niche industry. 

We are exclusively Linux based with the core product being written in PERL
(front end & backend) and satellite products written in PHP. 

We are looking for someone with experience of these, plus AJAX, Apache,
MySQL and XML being highly desireable as well. 
The role will primarily entail new application development and existing
application enhancement though the team is also responsible for server
administration, upgrades and monitoring. 

We are a young, fun company. The ideal candidate would have a ’work hard,
play hard’ attitude and a genuine interest in furthering themselves and the
company. 
We are based in Docklands (Canary Wharf), you should live within a
reasonable travelling distance. 

We would look to progress the right person as the company grows into
Europe, the USA and ultimately across the world. Excellent written & spoken
English is a must, and additional European languages (French, Dutch, German
etc) could come in handy too. 

If open source, Linux, and the Internet is your hobby, please apply
outlining your skills and what you think you can bring to the team.
