Job title:
Perl/C/Oracle web developer (CheetahMail/NYC)

Company name: CheetahMail Inc.

Internal ID: 56

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: $60K+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are a profitable and rapidly growing company in New York City (29
Broadway) that provides tools and services to manage our clients' email
communications with their customers. This includes email marketing, order
and shipment confirmation, registration pages, surveys, reporting,
analysis, and some custom development. You will do web and back-end
development, primarily in (mod_) Perl and against an Oracle database
(Solaris 8 and Linux). For performance and security critical parts of the
application, you will use many tools and the C coding style of Dan
Bernstein (http://cr.yp.to/). Your broad interest in and knowledge of how
things really work combined with your Unix philosophy of simple reusable
components, stream processing, and attention to detail will be highly
valued and continually honed. You will be part of a 15 member tech team
without excessive specialization;  you keep sharp not only in Perl, but
also in SQL, Oracle, networking, firewalls, and protocol design. Profile,
benchmark, regression test. The team-spirit is "dot-com", but the working
conditions are not!


Required skills:
See above. Love of programming, BS in computer science or equivalent
knowledge, expert Perl abilities, and several years of programming
experience.   Basic SQL, basic knowledge of some relation database server.
Residence in the NYC area.

Desired skills:
Network/Socket programming. Linux sysadmin skills, UDP, TCP, TTL, MTU,
network security. Population statistics. Understanding of Oracle
(parameterization of queries, ORA-01555, SGA, consistent reads). Experience
with/prior contribution to Open Source.
