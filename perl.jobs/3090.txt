Description:
123Doc Medical Courses is an online education company providing online
courses and online videos to doctors. We are seeking a Perl programmer /
web developer to join our IT team.

The position requires the ability to work both autonomously and with
others, under a varying degree of supervision within a small team.

Although 123Doc specialises in providing resources for doctors, no previous
medical knowledge is required.

Applicants should send a covering letter by email to russell@123doc.com,
enclosing a CV and giving details of at least two referees.  Selection will
be by interview, at which candidates may be asked to provide examples of
their code.


Required skills:
Extensive knowledge and experience of Perl (including object oriented Perl)
and a strong knowledge of SQL (preferably including exposure to MySQL) are
essential.   A high standard of written English is required.


Desired skills:
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP is desirable; knowledge of the
Template Toolkit Perl module would also be helpful.  A background in Unix /
Linux would be an advantage.
