This position involves a unique mix of distributed network security,

network model control. We are seeking engineering candidates with
demonstrated background experience in 

* IP networking and internetworking fundamentals, understanding the innards

filtering/firewalls, and network application handling 
* Perl, including object extensions. That's the major implementation
language for the dynamic components and layer you'd be working on.  We need
to see a demonstrated background  and command in Perl programming beyond
“Hello, World” and 10 line single-module sysadmin scripts.
* XML grammars and XML-based language systems, with background in and
understanding of transform 
technologies (XSLT, XPath, etc. etc.) ideally. 

In addition to those key points, it would be awesome if you had background
in any or all of: 
Java, network management/SNMP, UML and information modeling. If you've
worked configuring network devices and designing/deploying networks network
in the past we particularly want to talk to you.
The position involves equal parts coding the network device configuration
transform in Perl, and researching and knocking around to understand the
configurations and configuration formats you’ll be transferring.

Perl
XML
Linux/UNIX
JAVA related technologies (JMS, JDBC, ect.)
