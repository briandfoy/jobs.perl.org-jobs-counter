Job title: Software engineer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: SE

Location: Ladera Ranch, CA, United States

Pay rate:
DOE, but usually $45K to $100K plus quarterly bonuses

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IntelliSurvey develops cutting-edge software for web surveys and online
reports.  Sure, there are many ways to deploy simple web surveys, but we
focus on the most complex and tricky projects.	For example, we run
Fortune's Most Admired Company's survey, which goes out to thousands of
CEOs and Fortune 1000 board members.  We handle complex surveys that go out
to hundreds of doctors, with each one being paid a few hundred bucks to
take the survey.  So our software has to handle things like quotas, complex
branching, fraud detection, and many other things that simple tools don't
even think of doing.  We also need advanced tools that allow clients to
slice and dice the survey data we collect.  All of our software is
web-based, and we use it internally and license it via an SaaS model.

Note that we aren't looking for people to program surveys (at least not
with this posting).  We already have another team that does survey
programming and works with market research clients on a daily basis.  This
posting is all about finding candidates to build the software that builds
the surveys.  We need programmers who can write clean, modular code to help
us extend and improve our software.  Now is a great time to join our team,
as we in the midst of designing and developing a major new release of our
software.  This includes re-writing our code to use Moose and Plack/PSGI.

Experience with the technologies we use is great (see list below), but more
important that any particular skill is the ability to learn quickly, figure
things out on the fly, and make things happen.	We are willing to train new
team members as needed to fill in any gaps in experience.

In addition, because we are a small team, team members need to be able to
wear many hats and fill in where needed.  Everyone helps with client
support, and some server administration and IT work comes up from time to
time as well, so adaptability and experience in these areas is helpful as
well.

We will consider a range of candidates, from entry-level to experienced.

*About IntelliSurvey, Inc.*

We're a small, growing company.  Currently we have about 50 employees, and
we are planning to grow significantly over the new few years.  We are
funded entirely through operating cash flow, however, so we are stable and
free to grow at our own pace.

We offer standard benefits such as a retirement plan with company match,
health and dental insurance, stock options, and so on.	Many of our
employees work remotely, so our offices in Ladera Ranch, CA are small, and
we can't offer a company cafeteria.  But we are very flexible and focus on
results rather than face time.	After initial training, our development
team members can have flexible work hours and some work from home
arrangements as well.

People who are self-starters and can work independently will fit in well
with our team.
