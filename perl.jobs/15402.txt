Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: The Conference Exchange

Location: Cumberland, RI, United States

Pay rate: Based on Experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
The Conference Exchange (http://www.confex.com/) is hiring a developer to
work on our conference management software. We help professional societies
collect and manage hundreds of thousands of abstracts, manuscripts, and
other files. Our focus is on the content: collecting it, organizing it, and
sharing it online. We do this using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl) and
other open source technologies.

On this job you will be primarily writing
code based on the requests of our support team and clients. Our web app is
written in OO Perl. When you begin, you will work on simple bug fixes;
support staff writes up the requirements and design and as a developer you
will implement their request. Once situated and knowledgeable in Perl and
the nuances of our code base, you will be assigned projects that add new
functionality to our system; this would include writing your own
requirements, design, UI, etc. Support would approve your design, and then
you would get to implement it from the ground up.

You will be working on a
team of 8 developers and while we all work on tasks separately, questions
and white board discussions are common. For the first week you will learn
the basics of how to access the code base, our object model; the high level
'what we do and how we do it' items. Then you're off and running writing
code with your first bug fix/small client level enhancements.

Flexible
working environment with casual, open-office setup - no cubicles.

Desired skills:
* Experience in object-oriented programming with at least 3 months software
development experience on the job. (yes, internships count)
* Excellent
attention to detail, communication skills, and ability to learn quickly.
*
Experience with Perl, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
* Knowledge of inner
workings of systems and/or database
