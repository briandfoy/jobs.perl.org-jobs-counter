Job title: Perl web application developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: P1

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: Negotiable, DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts advanced online surveys and online
reports for a variety of clients in the market research industry. We offer
both software licensing via an SaaS model for our do-it-yourself clients,
and we program surveys using our own software on a project-by-project basis
for clients who would rather outsource all survey set up.

Our core software is built using Perl, mod_perl, DBI, and Apache running on
Linux servers.	Our front-end also makes use of javascript, including
libraries such as jQuery and ExtJS.  We are currently planning a major new
release and refactor of our core software, and so we need developers to
join our team and help make this happen.

We are primarily posting for local job in southern California.	However, we
will consider remote employees with the right background and skill, or
contract to hire arrangements.	In addition, even local employees will have
flexible hours and the ability to work some of the time from home. 

Required skills:
- the ability to write clean, modular, and understandable code
- excellent communication skills
- the ability to work well in teams
- Object-oriented Perl experience
- the ability to learn quickly and apply new skills to the task at hand.

Desired skills:
Other useful skills:

- experience with mod_perl
- DBI and PostgreSQL and/or general database experience
- Javascript, and in particular experience with the jquery and extjs
libraries would be helpful.
- Linux system administration skills
