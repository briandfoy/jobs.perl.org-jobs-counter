Description:
Grady Levkov & Company is a recruiting firm that specializes in technical

focus on engineering and quantiative roles in finance.

A very successful financial software company is looking for exceptional
unix developers with significant experience with Perl. The ideal person
will 
likely come from an OO-Perl development background and have a very strong
knowledge of unix and C.  Experience developing SCM  (CVS, Subversion etc)
and build systems is also a major plus. Only those with strong people
skills should apply. Extensive opensource experience is desirable.  This is
a full-time role.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Required skills:
Strong OO-Perl skills.	Good knowledge of Unix and C.

Desired skills:
An ideal candidate will likely	have a strong knowledge of opensource
technologies.	It would be helpful to have experience creating build and
release systems and some knowledge of Subversion or Make.  However, this is
not a requirement like the  strong perl skills.
