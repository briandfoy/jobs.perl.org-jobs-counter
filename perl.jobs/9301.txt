Job title:
Modern perl engineer (and minister to the corrupted), for a Los Angeles
based venture backed startup. (Melrose & LaBrea)

Company name: ModernFeed

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Pay rate:
Competitive depending upon experience (80k-140k++ USD).  The right talent
is worth the cash. (+ equity)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Modernfeed.com is a Los Angeles based start-up with a mission to be the
definitive guide to finding video on the web. Available media covers the
spectrum from broadcast and cable TV shows, to web original comedy, and
high quality educational programming. Working at Modern Feed will offer the
opportunity to explore and structure the ground floor of a world-class
website and service.

We're in the process of a cultural awakening.  Initially a Java house for
the first proof of concept, we're broadening our horizons and could really
use modern perl developers who grok data.  Must be prepared to work solo,
evangelize when appropriate, educate as applicable, and recruit towards a
mighty Perl empire as necessary.

Depending upon experience, passion, and ideas, we could be talking about
you building specific core systems, performing data-driven research, or
architecting the next serving platform and approach.	This *is* a
startup, so it means many hats, and a fair amount of responsibility
(venture backed, so with competitive compensation.)


Required skills:
* you have production experience with modern Perl development.	Be ready to
talk   MooseX::Declare, Modern::Perl, Catalyst, Perl on the cloud, and
other stuff that would astound, amaze, and delight your 2002-styling elder
siblings.  

* you work with *nix (Darwin OK!)
   Make sure you feel comfortable in a *nix environment, and are willing to
learn more about the operations side of life.  Any admin/networking
experience definitely a plus.  We get our hands dirty here!

* you love the idea of playing with large datasets.
   We're building complex systems with fascinating data, and doing a lot
with it.

* you have communication skills on par with your rugged techismo.
   We're a team: ideas, feedback, and communication are almost as critical
as raw problem-solving ability.

* you're in Los Angeles.
   That's where we are. We're not hiring remote workers. We're looking
forward to some intense and fast paced face-to-face brainstorming sessions.

Desired skills:
* In addtion to Perl, we'd like production experience with Linux, Lisp,
Haskel, Java, JavaScript, XML, Erlang, Python, EC2, Mathematica, Ruby,
Apache, or MySQL. (note the lack of an XOR, but please feel free to guess
which we think are more interesting).
   We don't expect you to have been doing production web-service code since
you were four, while optimizing your own compilers, and managing your own
cloud-site, but you should be curious, quick, passionate, and a hard
worker.  We do expect strong analytical skills, and some real experience
working in a production environment (we also have internship positions for
those new to the workforce).  Surprise us with what you've explored in the
past.
