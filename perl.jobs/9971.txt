Pay rate: 80-90K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Perl Developers Needed!!

Dynamic company in South Florida is seeking programmers who understand that
Perl is a very serious, high-level programming language used in large,
complex, high-performance applications, and not just a "scripting
tool.&#8203;"  Experience with Windows will not be held against you, but
development is performed exclusively in Linux.&#8203; You should be at home
on Linux, BSD, or Unix variants.

Required skills:
    * 3+&#8203; years experience programming in Perl in a Linux environment

    *SQL experience (we use MySQL)
    *HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, CGI and web development experience
    *Full project life cycle experience
    *Strong written and verbal communication skills
    *Ability to work in a team and solo
    *Strong attention to detail


Desired skills:
Local candidates preferred, however, will consider someone out of the area
if they have the desire to move to sunny South Florida and be a part of a
great team of developers!!
