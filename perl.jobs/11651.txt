Job title: Kick Ass Perl (Moose) Developer Needed

Company name: Bweeb.com

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are 100% remotely based as a company so this a work from home position.

Broad Job Description

We are looking for a kick ass developer to take over an existing code base
that is about 12 months old. Everything is based on Perl (Moose) and you
need to be familiar with it. The system installs scripts like WordPress and
Magento over FTP along with interactions with APIs, MySQL, and more. In
addition it automatically upgrades those scripts when updates come out and
allows for robust file management to install addons for those scripts. This
all sits under an XML-API that our frontend systems use to allow end-users
to install scripts easily plus a lot more.

You can see the beta of the frontend at WebPub.com and get a better idea of
what we are building too, contact me for more details,
Thanks, Ben

PS. This is a 4 person company, you will be fully in charge of the backend.
2 of us work on the frontend, and another on operations/marketing. We also
own a few large hosting companies with 68+ remote employees so this isn't
our first rodeo.

You will have documentation, training and support by the original developer
in taking over the code base.  To apply , please submit your resume and
code samples, preferably using some of the required technologies.
