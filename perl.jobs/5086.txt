Description:
How often does an opportunity come along to build a product that will end
up in the hands of millions of customers and shape the future of the mobile
entertainment industry? 

At AirG we’re developing mobile communities and wireless social networking
products that resonate with the hip and trend defining 16 – 30 demographic.
We’re working with industry leaders such as TELUS, Verizon and Sprint
Nextel to define an entirely new way of interacting with your mobile phone.
In our ideally situated office on fashionable Robson Street in Vancouver,
we’re creating products that enable millions of customers to get connected.
Wirelessly.

AirG’s mobile community has more than seven million registered users
worldwide and is available on more than 85 mobile operators in 33
countries, and growing! To further accelerate this rapid growth, we are in
search of talented Software Developers to join our Integration team.

A solution-oriented and pragmatic developer, you learned the tricks of your
trade in a software development environment that employed standardized
methodologies and software languages such as C++.  More recently, you have
developed a broader skill set including LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
PERL/PHP), JavaScript, xHTML, CSS, Unix Shell, REGEX, DB Design, XML, RPC
and CVS.

We work in a carrier grade, high uptime, secure and optimized web
environment that will enable you to use all of your skills to develop
application servers and dynamic interfaces, design databases and manage
schema/data.

You have at least 3 years’ experience in developing and integrating
software (preferably for a wireless solutions developer) and a
post-secondary education in computing science or engineering, or an
equivalent combination of experience and education.

In addition to having a flexible and relaxed work environment, we believe
that our culture and values set us apart. The values that we all share and
look for in those we work with include being entrepreneurial, passionate,
creative and fun. AirG offers an attractive and competitive compensation
package, a comprehensive benefits plan including a flexible wellness
program and staff purchase plan for mobile devices.
