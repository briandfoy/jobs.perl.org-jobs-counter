Job title: Linux Systems Perl/DBI Programmer

Company name: Essenz Consulting

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Pay rate: Negotiable (USD)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
My client, a regional telecommunications company, is looking to hire a
fulltime systems programming. The majority of the work will focus on Perl
for web application development. The apps are all database related so
familiarity with DBI is important, especially for MySql - though there is
some Oracle. One of the first projects the candidate will head up is the
creation of an asset tracking system. Other existing projects include the
continuing development of a traffic reporting and graphing application that
utilizes MRTG. The candidate will be hired as a programmer, but will work
in the SysAdm team. You will be encourage to grow your knowledge of systems
and network administration as you may become a backup resource to the
SysAdm group if that is something you are interested in. When submitting
resume/cover letter please indicate your desired salary. Company will pay
competitively based on experience level. All experience levels are
encouraged, however, we are ideally looking for someone with 3-5 years of
experience.

Required skills:
Perl development with a focus on web-based applications. Exposure to DBI
and MySql database is a must. You also need a good understanding of HTML,
though, you dont have to be an expert since we have people that can do some
of the more heavy HTML portions.

Desired skills:
HTML and PHP experience is a plus for some of the front-end work. Also,
some of our Perl applications interface with MRTG, Nagios, and other type
of monitoring systems, so exposure to these tools is a plus. We would also
like an individual with good exposure to linux and open source technologies
in general. Java exposure is not a requirement, but we do have some old
applications that were written in Java and may need to be ported to Perl,
so experience there is also a plus.
