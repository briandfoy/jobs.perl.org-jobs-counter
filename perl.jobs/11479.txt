Description:
Slando are looking for Senior Perl developers to join our technology team.
Slando is a small close knit company which embraces Agile development
ethos, and brings together people from diverse backgrounds and cultures
which compliment Slando’s multinational website. As a member of the
technology team you will be expected to learn from, share your knowledge
with and write code with your peers. We do not expect you to be a git guru
or a debutante DBA, nor do we expect you to be an expert in Map Reduce and
No SQL architectures, neither do we require you to understand the full
implications of running Lucene with over 15 Million documents in the cloud.
However, we do expect you to be passionate about writing good OO Perl,
preferably using Moose & Plack, in an MVC style with a keen interest in
being part of a team which is implementing all of the above technologies
and more.

As a small team our development environment embraces quality. We utilise 2
week iteration cycles, with release candidate testing, which allows for
hotfixes. We’re working towards nightly builds and fully automated unit and
selenium testing.

Slando itself is a large Classifieds website, covering 10 countries in 8
different languages, attracting over 100 million page views a month and
growing.. The role itself is based entirely in our central London office,
working hours are 8am to 4:30pm (with some flexibility).

Our Interview process involves an in house written perl test and some
homework, to give you an opportunity to shine and all of us the chance to
find out how well we can work together. We will consider a broad range of
experience levels for the role, if you can prove your skills in our test.
