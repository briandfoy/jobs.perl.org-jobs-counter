Job title: Senior Perl Engineer

Company name: Rent.com

Internal ID: PE-CON

Location: Los Angeles, CA, United States

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Rent.com is the leading online apartment rental listing service nationwide.
 We are headquartered in a beautiful Santa Monica class A office complex,
not far from the sunny Southern California beaches.  We have over 300 days
of sunshine within a region that encompasses ocean beaches, deserts and
mountains.  With just over 100 employees we are light on bureaucracy and
operate nimbly.

As a senior software engineer at Rent.com, you will write server-side code
for web-based applications.  We are looking for well-rounded engineers to
create robust high-volume production applications.  You should also have a
strong understanding of, and practical experience developing, web apps in
Perl.  We are looking for someone who is interested in making a big impact
as part of a small, dynamic team and is looking to have broad
responsibilities.

Rent.com engineers relish the freedom to create the next generation of our
offerings, in an environment designed to foster collaboration, creativity,
health, and happiness.	We are an agile shop utilizing scrum, story points,
and encouraging (but not dictating) TDD.

We currently have several open contracting positions, and one open FTE
position.  The full-time position is on-site only; we will consider
full-time telecommuting contractors, but the bar is correspondingly higher.
 We can only consider US residents at this time.

Required skills:
Advanced Perl, reasonable SQL, general hard core software development, and
decent Linux system administration.  You should have experience with
version control (we use Git) and be able to work effectively alone and as
part of a team.

Desired skills:
Moose, Catalyst, Template Toolkit, OOP.  Javascript a bonus.
