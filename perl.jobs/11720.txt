Job title: Perl developer for varied projects

Company name: Hutchinson Software Pty Ltd

Location: Armidale, NSW, Australia

Pay rate: AUD$60k-$70k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We have a position available for a full- or part-time (3+ full days)
software developer to join our small team (there's currently two of us)
working on projects in-house and for clients. We're looking for someone
with at least two years commercial software development experience, or very
compelling arguments if they lack experience.

You need to be someone who wants to solve problems without too much
guidance - ready to dive in and get up to speed across a range of
technologies and projects.

The role will involve projects using Perl and PHP. Expertise in Windows
Forms/C# will also be a plus. Our newer web projects use Perl/Catalyst, but
we continue to support and develop a large system in HTML::Mason.

We are continuing to develop and extend a suite of mobile apps on Android,
iOS, and Symbian (soon to be Windows Mobile).

We use JIRA/Greenhopper for project management, with primarily a
Linux-based development environment for web apps and VS2010 for Windows. We
use subversion with Hudson CI to support our agile and test-based
development processes.

If you worked for us, recently you might have worked on gardenate.com
(Catalyst/DBIx::Class/MySQL), nowfleet.com.au
(Catalyst/Ext.JS/DBIx::Class/Postgresql), and a number of other projects.
You might have:

* Designed and implemented dynamic PHP forms for a large web app. This
included wireframe design (on paper or html), modifying CSS, implementing
the form generation and form handler/validation code, and writing Selenium
tests for the forms.
* Converted a Catalyst web app to use a Shipwright-based installer instead
of a custom script.
* Fixed bugs in the REST code of a Catalyst web app and wrote
WWW::Mechanise-based test code to verify the fix.
* Wrote a suite of Perl scripts to run on Windows and import CSV files into
Access via DBI and post-processed the data to assign time-sequence
information.
* Modified PHP code generating Excel XLSX files to include a date in the
header cell, and change the code importing the files to read the header and
adjust the expected columns according to the year. Wrote tests to verify
XLSX file generation and import processes.

We're family-friendly with flexible working hours by arrangement and
telecommuting is expected.

We prefer applicants from AU/NZ as you must be able to work core hours in
GMT+10 timezone (Australia Eastern Standard Time) as we are regularly
interacting and discussing tasks during the work day.

If this sounds interesting, and you have relevant experience, please get in
touch.

Required skills:
Perl web development (Catalyst, HTML::Mason)
Class::DBI and/or DBIx::Class with MySQL/Postgresql
Experience with subversion version control

Desired skills:
GUI Development with Javascript - particularly Ext.JS
PHP experience
C# experience
Selenium-based web testing
