IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys for a variety of

through phone and email, and writing custom Perl code for client projects.


Required skills:
Object-oriented Perl, mod_perl, DBI and PostgreSQL are the primary skills

good personal skills and a professional manner with clients is essential.
The ability to work independently is also a must.

Desired skills:
Because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked to wear
different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to help the
company grow and prosper.
