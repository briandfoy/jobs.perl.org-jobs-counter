Job title:
Web developer for small consulting company

Company name: Develooper LLC

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6+ months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a developer or two to work on upcoming and ongoing
(mostly) web projects.	You will need to be available immediately at least
~15-25 hours a week.

I can't tell much about the projects, but they are fun and "cutting edge".

It's an advantage if you are in the Los Angeles, CA area, but you don't
have to be.  You do have to be available via Jabber at least during some of
the day (US pacific time).  :-)

Required skills:
* Must be highly organized, self-starter
* Excellent written and spoken communication

* Please be particularly proficient with:
* Perl OO programming
* SQL, MySQL, Class::DBI, Rose::DB::Object
* mod_perl
* General web development

Some of our projects have large complex Javascript components as well, so
proficiency in Javascript is an advantage.

Desired skills:
* Subversion or CVS
* MVC systems
* Experience with large systems
* AJAX
* CPAN or generally Open Source authors are especially encouraged to get in
touch
