Job title: Southern Records

Location: United Kingdom, London (Wood Green)

Pay rate: exploitative

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 6 months

Hours: Part time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Southern Records is looking for a part-time SQL/Perl/Linux type who’d like
to spend a few afternoons (15 hours) a week giving us a hand with the
development of a music database and some related technologies. This is tied
to a project for an initial six months, but the project and the position
may be extended after review.
 
This position would be ideal for a student looking to gain some experience.
You will need some experience with SQL and Perl--our staff can probably
teach you the rest. You’ll be working at a small office for a venerable
independent record group with a studio, a label, and a distribution company
in our Wood Green office in North London.
 
Those sensitive to incredibly loud rock music need not apply.

The application deadline is Monday, 30 January.

Required skills: SQL,Perl,Linux 

Desired skills: XML, other standard technologies
