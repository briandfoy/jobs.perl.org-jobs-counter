Job title:
Catalyst Developer for promotional download application

Company name: Southern Records

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate:
To be decided once we've discussed the spec

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We're looking for someone to help us develop a standalone Catalyst
application that will allow us to share digital promotional releases with
our customers and the press. The application should have the following
features, unless you'd like to take a stab at convincing me that any of
them are stupid:

Core features:

- Download code-based. The release is distributed by the user entering a
code into a form.

- Secure. We have a working prototype using standard Apache authentication
modules.

- CMS integration via REST

- File uploader. We need to upload the promos.

- Code generator. We need to generate/export codes for the promos.

There are a number of other features I'd like to discuss with the
developer. I've also got a functional specification I can show you, if
you're interested.

I'd like this to be done in modern Perl with full documentation so I can
maintain it and add to it in future.

Ideally, I would also like to meet with you, so this gives UK developers an
advantage.

Required skills:
Perl
Catalyst
Moose
DBIC
Apache
MySQL
RESTful services

Desired skills: Drupal "Services" module
