Job title: LAMP Database Developer and programmer

Company name: DHS-Club, Inc.

Location: United States, Florida, Englewood

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Unlimited longevity important

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
The organization has been in business for over 10 years, is a privately
owned organization, and is growing by factors of three. We are an
international discount shopping club that is both online and offline. We
have many projects in development but all are supported by a solid
financial structure and organization. With the longevity of the
organization came both upturns and downturns, but the vision of the owner,
Dick Burke, has fostered an environment where employees are empowered and
encouraged to expand their horizons and materially contribute in an
efficient and effective manner. I have just joined the organization a month
ago and at every turn, find the growth implications staggering and
inspiring. I encourage you to look at our website www.dhs-club.com to gain
a better perspective of the organization.
  The position requires the experience and expertise of Linux, Apache, SQL
(MySQL), and Pearl. The position would expand on our database and expedite
particular upgrade requests and the system continues to evolve using
particular scripting languages of the XML family, RSS and DSS, and other
tools. 
  Additionally, the position works with two other IT positions to foster an
unique team approach to aid in the many plans of the organization and to
add interesting and exciting enhancements. Aid in web development is also a
possibility and as you will note, the position does require many different
hats.
  The long-term perspective of the position could also lead into a
leadership and management role if the applicant is interested. In addition,
because we are approximately 80% international, our focus is to migrate to
a full global organization throughout the world. 
  If any of this sounds of interest, I would appreciate several minutes of
your time to further discuss the requirements. I can be reached at the
number below at anytime. I will be filling the position shortly and want to
expedite the process within the week. Also, I have attached the official
position Request. I look forward to hearing from you.


Required skills:
The position will be responsible for the organizations database structure
and queries. Particular note is the importance of LAMP application
interfaces to the database. There will be additional requirements to fill
in particular programming and scripting needs. In addition, the position
will be a three person team to function equally within the IT department.
Future consideration will be given to possible management.
