Job title:
Internet Applications Architect for Startup Firm

Location: Canada, Toronto

Pay rate: $4-6k CDN/month

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for a few great software engineers with substantial
experience building and launching consumer web applications.

What is critical is that you can document current/recent work that required
extensive use of Linux, Apache, Perl, PHP, PostgreSQL / MySQL, Javascript,
XHTML, XML, RSS, and Atom. (Since we're not developing in Windows, or .NET,
any such experience would not be as useful to our work.)

We're looking for candidates with these qualifications:

    * Lots of relevant experience

    * Fast learner, self-starter

    * Dependable, reliable, someone who can be counted on 

    * Excellent written and oral communications skills

    * Solid computer science understanding, with B.S. or higher 

    * Mobile programming experience: Not required but an asset for future
development ventures

    * An interest in server security, fraud analytics/detection, high
traffic load balancing/utilization and overall network management skills
are also desired.

In short, we're looking for smart people who can get things done.

Have you also contributed to open-source apps? Please let us know about it!
If you have a blog or homepage, send us the URL.

Be sure to provide examples of relevant apps/sites you've built, and a
cover letter explaining why we should hire you.
