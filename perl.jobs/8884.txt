Job title:
Perl Developers (All levels of experience) - Perl, PostgreSQL, Linux, C/C++

Company name: Candle Australia

Internal ID: PW14931

Location: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane

Pay rate: Up to $65K + super

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent, ongoing

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Are you sick of working for an average company?  Just because the economy
has taken a turn for the worst, doesn't mean your career should! 
 
Multiple permanent opportunities exist for Perl Developers to join a
leading ASX-listed software development and distribution house who can
confidently claim to be an employer of choice - something their competitors
can only dream about. 
 
Of course you are expected to produce brilliant work but you won't be
chained to your desk, expected to work ridiculous hours and sacrifice your
work life balance.  Instead your lunch-hour will be spent enjoying the
Plasma TV and Nintendo Wii in the lunchroom with your colleagues! You don't
have to wear a stuffy suit and you can wake up in the morning actually
wanting to get out of bed.   
 
Sound refreshing? 
 
My client boasts exciting project work, record profits, low staff turnover,
flexibility for staff and a desire to see you succeed. 
 
What do you need to secure this opportunity of a lifetime? 
 


Required skills:
You must have previous experience in Perl development, commercial
experience with SQL (my client uses PostgreSQL).  You will also have
ideally worked in a Unix (Linux) environment with some experience with C
and C++.  You must have strong communication skills with the ability to
work in a team environment and the drive to over-achieve. 


Desired skills: C/C++.
