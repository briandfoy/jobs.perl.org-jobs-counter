Job title: Perl Support Developer

Company name: Traveltek Ltd.

Internal ID: SDEV2

Location: United Kingdom, Glasgow, East Kilbride

Pay rate: Dependant on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Traveltek is the UK leader in online travel solutions, from consumer facing
websites to  call center applications. We have customers big and small,
from single high street agencies to the largest travel companies in the
world. We handle millions of page views per month, deal with databases that
process tens of millions of rows per hour, and offer a great environment
for the technically inclined to challenge their abilities.

We are currently seeking an individual to join our support team, assisting
our operations and development departments to deal with customer support
requests and configuration problems arising out of our array of web based
travel products.

The ideal candidate should have experience with Perl or PHP, or a similar
programming language with the capacity to learn Perl. While this isn't
really a programming job, you will be required to troubleshoot right down
to application code level. You should also have good overall computer
skills, as you will be dealing with a lot of internal systems,
troubleshooting failed travel bookings, following XML trails, configuring
our online products and testing systems. This however, is not a hardware
related position.

Some knowledge of Linux or other flavour of UNIX would be a plus, as this
is what our whole platform runs on. Some database experience is definitely
a must, MySQL especially. And as you will dealing with customers and we
pride ourselves on good service, good communication skills are key.
Finally, you'll need a willingness to learn. Almost everything we do is
likely to be new to you, and you should be ready for a challenge.

This position is based in our Head Office in East Kilbride and the
successful candidate will benefit from a competitively based salary.

Required skills:
Perl
MySQL

Desired skills:
Apache
Linux
mod_perl
