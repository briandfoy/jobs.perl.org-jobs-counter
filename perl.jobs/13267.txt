Job title: Senior Developer

Company name: Photobox Limited

Location: Paddington, London

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Senior developers are primarily responsible for writing quality code for
the web to meet the business needs.  They have a critical eye for good
markup and client-side code and an eye for building interfaces that work as
closely as possible across different browsers and device restrictions. In
so doing, they may work in a peer programming fashion with other developers
or testers or work more independently. Either way they are creating code
that meets the team’s mission.

We are in the process of building a new web platform (Linux, Apache, PHP
Symfony framework, Node.js, mongoDB)  to support Photobox’s ambitious plans
for growth over the next few years. Our existing web platform (Linux,
Apache, perl) remains central to our core business, and code is being
migrated to a SOA stack and appropriate API layers over this: we need a
strong team of developers who can maintain and extend functionality in line
with business needs, whilst carrying out this migration. This senior role
will form part of our Core platform team and over time the team will
transition to and take ownership of the new web platform.

Required skills:
* Linux – knowledge of Linux systems down to kernel level.
* Perl – at least 5 years experience of OO Perl, with application in web
development
* Database design and administration – particularly with MySQL
* Scalability through the use of Caching e.g. CDNs memcached, site/db
optimization techniques
* Domain knowledge: Perl, CPAN, SQL, XML, Linux
SVN, GIT, CI (Hudson / Jenkins), bash
* Agile Development

Desired skills:
* Mason – or working knowledge of some other web framework e.g, Dancer
php (Symfony, Zend)
* Integration with third-party APIs
* Exposure to NoSQL e.g. MongoDB, to Node.js, Ruby helpful
eCommerce – payments, security, high volume transactions and public facing
websites
