Job title: King of PostgreSQL

Company name: BackCountry.com

Location: United States, UT, Park City

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Backcountry.com is still growing at a rate somewhere between 'strong' and
'wacko'. As such, our PostgreSQL Db needs are becoming more and more
complex, and we need a DBA who knows PostgreSQL like the back of his/her
hand.

Our environment is pretty straightforward: webservers talk to an order
conglomerator, which talk to the back-end, which then shoves things out to
the warehouse for shipping. Okay-- it's more complex than that, but I am
trying to describe a straight-up ecommerce site with a ton of traffic.


Desired skills:
Do you have the chops?
- Can you tell me about how you would sync across multiple environments?
- How about triggers?
- What is the most complex PostgreSQL deployment that you've done?
- What was the coolest PostGreSQL deployment you've done?
- What ecommerce have you done?
- How have you dealt with Perl environments connecting to a db before?
