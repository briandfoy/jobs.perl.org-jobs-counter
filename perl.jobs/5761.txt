Job title:
Perl/Java/C++/Swing Developer for Bank Client

Company name: Stamford Consultants

Internal ID: JJ864JH

Location: Switzerland, Zurich, Zurich

Pay rate: +/- CHF90.00 per hour

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6-12 Months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking to build up a team of people to automate our build, test,
release, configure and rollback processes for our in-house developed
software. Currently, the entire end-to-end chain is manual work. 

This project will provide significant cost savings by eliminating the time
required for the entire process and reducing the incidence of manual errors
though automating the routine work. Because of the complex nature of the
current setup and the large number of applications to be
migrated, we estimate this project lasting at least a year. 

This is a contract position working in a large banking environment.

Finding a way to work within the set of rules and regulations which make up
a large investment bank while still delivering the desired result is a key
part of the job. We're looking for people who deliver solutions.

The ideal candidate should have a good understanding of wrapping C++
classes using Swig and generating Perl interfaces to those classes. He or
she should also have a good understanding of the software development
process at a high-level and familiarity with common Unix development
tools (eg: make, SunWorkshop, GNU g++, Purify, ClearCase, Subversion). 

Knowledge of C#, Java, Ant, Apache, Tomcat, Oracle, MSSQL and Sybase are
all helpful, as are any other relevant development skills which can be
brought to bear on this problem.

We have three openings at the moment: one Senior and two Junior. If you
don't see yourself as a perfect match to this but believe that you still
have the drive to contribute, let us know. We're not going to go down a
checklist only accepting the perfect fit. Finding someone with the right
drive and attitude counts at least as strongly as the right list of skills.

Required skills:
Make, SunWorkshop, GNU g++, Purify, ClearCase, Subversion

Desired skills:
C#, Java, Ant, Apache, Tomcat, Oracle, MSSQL and Sybase
