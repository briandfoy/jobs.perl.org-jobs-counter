Description:
Grand Virtual is seeking an experienced Perl developer.  We use mod_perl,

do business all over the world.  If you have multilingual development or
international e-commerce skills - or you want to acquire some - GV may be
the place for you.

Note: Sorry recruiters and agencies, but we'll only accept resumes directly
from candidates.

Location:
You'll need to be within commute distance to Cambridge, MA.  For this role,
we're looking for local talent.

- OOP
- strong SQL
- Apache, including prior mod_perl experience

technologies, but have the required skills above, please get in touch.
