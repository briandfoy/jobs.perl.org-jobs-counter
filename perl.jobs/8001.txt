Raybec Communications is looking to add a Perl Application Developer to

    * take pride in everything you do
    * handle multiple projects at one time
    * are comfortable asking the questions you need to ask in order to get
the job done right
    * have proven experience working in a fast-paced environment
    * are comfortable working both in a team and self-managed environment 


Required skills:
    * Unix/Linux "power user" or sysadmin skills
    * Object Oriented Perl 5 (able to create new modules and classes from
scratch)
    * CGI::Application, HTML::Template
    * Perl DBI
    * MySQL database use and administration
    * Strong familiarity and capability with HTML, JavaScript and CSS
