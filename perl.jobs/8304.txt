Job title:
Perl Developer for leading provider of database automation solutions 

Location: United States, New York , New York 

Pay rate: $115,000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
My client is the leading developer of database management automation
software. The server side of Clarity is heavy on object-oriented Perl;
5.8.7 is supported (although we might migrate to 5.10 on all supported
platforms once it is burned in).

As Open Source fans, we’ve utilized many CPAN modules:

Module-Build-0.2806	XML-Xerces-2.7.0-0
 
As far as coding conventions, we use PBP and peer review (use strict; and
use warnings; are mandatory). Warnings are fatal (causing a die to occur).
All code must compile on all supported platforms prior to commit (Linux,
Solaris, Win32, HP-UX, etc.).
 
The work environment –
 
Located in the Flatiron District of New York, easily accessible from many
directions, our mission is to transform the way organizations manage their
database infrastructure through the use of automation. Development and QA
are sacred at my client and occupy a very special location – our
headquarters’ Penthouse suite. You’ll be with others who love what they do.
In a nutshell, the culture is inquisitive, collaborative, and
highly-energized. And the environment is programmer casual too.

You will be well paid, will receive benefits and stock options, and unlike
quite a few companies these days, we also provide relocation money for
stellar candidates as well as sponsorships and transfer visas as needed.

Even if you’re content where you are, and email us (no need to send your
resume), letting us know that you're happy – but give us a chance to
explain how our software developer opportunities may be superior to your
present situations.

But if you’re looking for a new place where you can expand your use of OOP
– C++ and Perl – surrounded by recognized experts. 


Required skills:
Requirements – Obviously you have an unbridled love of Perl. Additionally,
you’ll offer:
 
•	Significantly skilled with Perl (C++, PHP receive bonus points) 
•	Solid experience in TCP/IP network and/or distributed systems
programming 
•	Working with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL 
•	Fluency in Linux and/or flavors of UNIX 
•	Team lead experience would be very nice to have
