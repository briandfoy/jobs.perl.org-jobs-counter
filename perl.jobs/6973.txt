Job title: Decipher Web Developer

Company name: Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute

Internal ID: Ref PERL1401

Location: United Kingdom, Hinxton; Cambridge

Pay rate: £26,650 - £35,875

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute uses large-scale sequencing,
informatics and analysis of genetic variation to understand gene function
in health and disease and to generate resources of lasting value.
The DECIPHER project - Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in
Humans using Ensembl Resources is an international collaboration between
Clinical and Medical Genetics laboratories worldwide. Its aims are to
collect and correlate pathogenic submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances;
namely chromosomal microdeletions/duplications/insertions, translocations
and inversions and display this information on the human genome map with
the aims of:
• Increasing medical and scientific knowledge about chromosomal
microdeletions/duplications.
• Improving medical care and genetic advice for individuals/families with
submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance.
• Facilitating research into the study of genes which affect human
development and health.
The project is entering an exciting expansion phase and to help accommodate
this we need to extend the website and its database presence accordingly.
The project website (http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/) which is hosted by the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is written in a combination of
HTML/CSS/Javascript and PERL served over SSL with a MySQL database hosting
the data.


Required skills:
To facilitate this expansion we are seeking to employ a Senior Web
Developer. The successful candidate will work as part of the Sanger web
team. Applicants will be expected to have a Computer Science/Bioinformatics
degree or extensive relevant experience. 

Desired skills:
Experience of working with PERL programming language in a Unix environment,
MySQL, Apache Webserver software, web configuration and troubleshooting,
HTML/CSS/Javascript is essential. Experience of working with Object
oriented software design, SSL, a good understanding of web security, web
systems administration and web architecture design is desirable.
