Description:

site of it's kind in the world. (really)

    http://mvhub.com

"Best" is a relative term, for comparison see:

    http://www.bostonresourcenet.org/new.cfm

We're looking for somebody to make improvements using Perl and SQL.

Knowing Perl now is not a firm requirement, but it sure would be nice.
We're willing to teach the right person.

    HTML::Template
    Test::More

DISCLAIMERS

US Citizenship or a green card are required.

This is an Americorps/VISTA position. The 
goal is to eliminate poverty. An important 
method is sacrifice.

Other people in the program work at homeless 
shelters or teach literacy.

We write software.

You get paid $10,000 per year with basic 
health coverage for full time work.

Our goal is to make this a permanent position 
at close to market rate. We've had this goal 
for several years. This year we've gotten closer
than before, but this is still a goal not a promise.

Required skills: Basic Software development

Desired skills:
Perl

    HTML::Template
    Test::More
