Job title: Web Developer for Healthcare ASP

Company name: Medikin Incorporated

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: $20

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: long term

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
If you are looking for a long-term position which gives you the flexibility
to work from your current location, this could be a good opportunity for
you.

Medikin Incorporated is a Healthcare IT company based in New York City.
More specifically we are a TASP or Transcription ASP. Our software
automates the daily workflow for more than 100 medical transcription
companies. We've been in business since 2002. 

We have a number of projects which we would like to implement in the near
future, so we are looking for a few eager developers to become an integral
part of our development team. The technical requirements for the positions
are as follows:


Required skills:

   1. PERL / CGI - the more experience the better since the application is
written almost entirely in PERL.
   2. Familiarity with best practices in application development,
documentation, etc.
   3. Ability to understand and unwind spaghetti code. See number 2 above.
We are working towards that.

Desired skills:
A. Project management in software development. We are looking for a team
leader who has demonstrated skills in this area.
B. Familiarity with PHP and Javascript is useful.
C. A bigger plus would be familiarity with Windows interfacing technologies
and programming including ASP.NET and Java as we have some component
development projects which would require those skills
D. Familiarity with PostgreSQL is a plus. Advanced DBA skills would be
great so that we can optimize queries and keep the database well tuned.
E. Sysadmin skills with the LAMP stack. See number 1 and item C above –
replace mySQL and PHP with PostgreSQL and PERL. If you don't know it all
but have admin'd linux boxes in production environments you get the idea.
We have a full-time sysadmin so we're not expecting the candidate to stray
too much from development work. This is more for backup and occasional
loadbalancing of our sysadmin.
F. Speaking of backup and loadbalancing, we're aiming to build our app into
a bulletproof ASP, so we're investigating various high availability and
scalability solutions such as replication and clustering. If you have
familiarity with these tools and could help us devise and build the
solution that would be a major plus.
