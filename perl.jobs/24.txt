Subject: Correction to Previous post - Looking for Perl Projects
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: slloyd@inshift.com ("Steven Lloyd")

NOTE: Correction to previous job post.  I typed my resume URL incorrectly.
(.com instead of .org).  Thanks.

I am currently looking for perl projects to work on.
I have a considerable amount of experience with MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL,
MS-Access, and other databases.
I am comfortable developing on both Unix and Win32 platforms.

I am willing to work hourly  or bid on contracts.

If you need collaborative web-based applications built, intranets,
extranets, or would just like your website to be dynamic, I can help.

My resume can be found at http://www.wordperfect.org/slloyd/
