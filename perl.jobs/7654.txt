Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
ok( $you->enjoy_problem_solving() );
ok( $you->strive_for_simplicity() );
ok( $you->write_tests_first() );
ok( $you->want_to_enjoy_your_job() );

Do you pass these tests? If so, you should be writing software at Airwave
Wireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of
our time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback
loops speak louder than excessive documentation and month-long design
meetings. We practice test-driven development and have a comprehensive
suite of tests... over 31,000 at last count. We pair program, so you'll
learn the system quickly and have a great time doing it. We have short
release cycles, which means your talents
won't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of day.
Software you write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a
couple of weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP
project in the
industry (six years and counting), so we have gotten quite good at
embracing XP's advantages while avoiding its pitfalls.

Personally, I enjoy working at Airwave more than any job I've ever had.  I
am excited to come into work every day, I work hard for eight hours solving
challenging problems, and then go home to lead a well balanced life outside

of work.  When I'm at work I get to interact closely with a group that is
brilliant, funny, motivated, and inspiring.  I spend most of the day
smiling, laughing, and learning.  The team we've built is truly a special
group, and I'm proud and honored to be a part of it.

Excited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. Airwave developers write software
in several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux
systems. We
use Apache mod_perl2 for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for our back-end
persistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge of network
protocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP.

Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task, but our products help to
ease that burden. We build network management software that is used by many
of the
leading IT organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major universities,
hospitals, and other prominent institutions. Our industry-leading software
helps plan, configure, manage, and monitor some of the largest wireless
networks on the planet.

Required skills:
 * Perl
 * Object-oriented programming
 * Strong refactoring and design ability

Desired skills:
 * Experience developing automated tests
 * Apache mod_perl
 * Basic SQL (PostgreSQL experience a plus)
 * Experience with agile software development
 * Function or logical programming expeience
 * Linux application development
 * Knowledge of TCP/IP and 802.11 wireless networking
