Description:
We are looking for 3 highly experienced senior Perl developers to join an
existing team of 14. Within an agile project management framework (Kanban)
you will be part of a team whose job it is to understand user requirements,
design solutions, and develop and test multi-tier implementations to
address the requirements. The work is an interesting mixture of enhancing a
mature, existing codebase along with new projects using webservices, AJAX
and system integration. 

The job will be based in the beautiful county of Cornwall (surf, sea, fresh
air). Our preference is to employ the successful candidate as a permanent
employee (although contract employment can also be offered).

Required skills:
Perl
SQL (any flavour)
Team Worker
Passionate about good software
Professional
Architectural experience

The candidate will have extensive commercial Perl software development
experience including database development (PostgreSQL, MySQL or other SQL).
However, C/C++ Programmers can also apply although these are Perl Developer
positions. Ideally the candidate will have worked in a team. It is expected
that the candidate will have, at least, an understanding of Agile as a
philosophy, Agile frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, XP) and as a practice (e.g.
TDD, CI etc.). Agile team experience would be a significant benefit but not
essential. The candidates should also have commercial experience of source
control systems and concepts.PERL (CPAN, OO Perl)

Desired skills:
OO Perl
Javascript (JQuery, JSON, AJAX)
Catalyst or other MVC framework
CPAN User/Contributor
PostgreSQL
GIT
