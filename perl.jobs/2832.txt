Description:
** NO AGENCIES PLEASE **

You'd be part of a team of around 3 technical staff, looking after a set of
around 5 existing projects including BBC Search, CMS systems and Postcode
based apps.  Flexibility is key, as there are a number of code bases with
varying degrees of integration.  It's mostly supporting existing code and
minor extensions rather than green field development.

We're based at the BBC campus at White City.  Work is on site - no remote
working.

Legal stuff:

- we can't sponser visas, so you need to be legal to work in the uk already

- you'll need to invoice us through a limited company, which you'll need to
sort out.
- you'll have to accept the standard bbc terms and conditions
- 37 hours per week

Required skills:
- solid perl, dbi essential, as is knowing your way around cpan, cvs & unix
shell
- some decent experience developing against Apache, RDBMS (one or more of
Oracle/Postgres/MySql) and supporting existing code.
- good interpersonal skills & some experience with technical design
