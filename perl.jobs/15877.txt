Job title:
The only (UK) Perl job with a swimming pool -- Financial Services

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: Depending on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The best thing – in my opinion, anyway – about working for a development
team led by an active member of the London Perl community, is that you know
management love Perl, support using the best available Perl tooling, and
will create a technical environment where Perl developers will be happy.
You will be happy here!

Client is a financial services company based in
the City of London, and is the only Perl employer in the world (apart from
Evozon) to have a swimming pool onsite. Notably friendly and welcoming
environment, with modern codebase.

Desired skills:
- Have Modern Perl experience;
- An existing right to work in the UK;
-
Want to work with a group of friendly, nice people;
- Think going for a
swim after a hard day of Perl hacking sounds ideal (optional)
