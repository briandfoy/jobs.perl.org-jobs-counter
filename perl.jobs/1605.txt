Job title: Perl Book Technical Reviewer

Pay rate: ~ $800

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 month

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Telecompute project. Short deadline. Seeking experienced
Perl programmer to proof read draft book text for
style and technical accuracy. (This is standard practise
for new technical books - see the "Acknowledgements"
section of any Perl text).

Required skills:
Perl 5 fluency. Must have read the Apocalypses -
and understood a lot of it, too. (Yeah, that's almost
more absurd of a requirement than "20 years Java
experience").

Desired skills:
Involvement in Perl 6 discussions on the
perl6-language list or Perl Monks highly desireable.
Should have a strong sense of what the Perl communities
good style (and bad style). Should have read numerous
Perl books and have well developed opinions of which
are good and which are bad. Understanding of PONIE,
Parrot helpful. Open source involvement, such as
authoring CPAN modules, helpful. Experience with
writing or technical writing also helpful. But these
are all desirements ;)

Contact information:
scott@slowass.net - no attachments, please!
This will be closed within two weeks - probably one week -
due to time constraints on my part. Please send me a 
atleast a single paragraph listing which of these
requirements and desirements you can claim and anything
else you want to tell me that I'm likely to want to know.
If I'm not likely to recognize your name please include
a link to a resume (do not attach, but you may paste in
ASCII if you like). I access mutt via ssh so binary
attachments are time consuming ;) If I don't likely know
who you are, a link to code you've written would be
helpful, too.
Thank you! Best wishes!
