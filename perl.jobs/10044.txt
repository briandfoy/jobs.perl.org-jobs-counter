Job title:
Engineering Manager for local/remote team

Company name: Lokku Ltd.

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: Above market

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Lokku is the company that makes the Nestoria property search engine.

  http://www.lokku.com/
  http://www.nestoria.com/

Our team has grown from 4 to 11 over the last few years and is about to
grow some more.  We are looking to immediately hire a senior software
engineer with management experience.

Some highlights:

* This job will involve managing people, but we are not looking for someone
that has given up on coding.  This role >will< be committing to the source
repository.

* We love Perl, but we are willing to bring someone in that has not yet
learned to love Perl quite as much as us.  Please distribute this
announcement to anyone that you think is a first rate engineering manager
no matter what their language or editor preference.

* Lokku is willing to pay a higher-than-average salary for a
better-than-average person.  We also offer ownership in the company through
a share option scheme that is tax efficient.

* We are not truly a start-up anymore, but we will never be a "big"
company.  Lokku needs someone that can wear a lot of hats and thrive
without structure.

Required skills:
perl
apache
mysql
UNIX
man-management

Desired skills:
jquery
automated testing
scalable architectures
high-volume data processing
building fast
