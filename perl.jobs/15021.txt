Job title: Seeking Full Stack Developer Relations Liaison

Company name: Speakeasy Strategies

Location: SF or Anywhere

Pay rate: Full market rate

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: Contract / Ongoing

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We’re seeking a developer with a minimum of 3-5 years of diverse
professional experience to work with some of the top companies in tech and
open source. Our company, Speakeasy Strategies, is a SF-based global
communications agency that is putting together a developer relations
program. The goal is to enable companies to keep track of community based
conversions and developers who are highly engaged in their category of
interest for the purposes of identifying opportunities and connecting with
the best minds in their field.

The perfect candidate would have at least intermediate knowledge of several
different kinds of programming languages and server technologies. You
should have an intimate understanding of community sites ranging from Stack
Overflow to Reddit and Quora. While you don’t need to be an expert in all
subject matter, you would need to know enough to be able to identify the
top contributors in those communities and be able to distill the most
meaningful conversations to help inform our clients of the overall pulse of
the content.

The position would be primarily research to begin with, in order to help us
solidify the overall methodology, but will soon grow to include regular
deliverables for clients. We estimate that it will take 20 hours/month to
start and then 20-30 hours/month once we start servicing clients. The
compensation is full market rate for your time and we're flexible on when
and where you work.

Required skills: Full stack dev (including perl) and server tech
