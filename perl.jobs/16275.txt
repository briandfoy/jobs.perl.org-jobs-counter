still be able to live where you want? If so, Grant Street Group is the
right place for you!

We are a growth-oriented privately held software
development company that supports a variety of clients in specialized
financial transactions. Our hosted Software as a Service (SaaS)
applications support tax collection, electronic payments, bond auctions and
more. We are always looking for talented Perl developers who want to learn
the business needs of our clients, make a difference in the automation of
business processes, and love writing great code.  We expect to hire more
developers later this year, so although we don't have an immediate opening,

to explain how they have used Perl in their careers. The capability to be a
positive collaborator and contributor to a team based success model is
essential.

We are based in Pittsburgh and have clients throughout the
country, including a significant presence in Florida and on both coasts.
Our professionals live throughout the United States so there is no need to
relocate. More than 80% of our developers telecommute so an understanding
of how to engage others using supportive technologies and either experience
with or willingness to learn how to be a remote contributor is required.
(You can live anywhere in the United States!)

Our extraordinary company
culture is the foundation of our unmatched customer service =E2=80=94 just =
