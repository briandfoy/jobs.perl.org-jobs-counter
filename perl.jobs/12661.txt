Job title: Perl Development Manager

Company name: Eligo Recruitment

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: £70000 to £90000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Perm

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
My client is UK & European leading advocate of Open Source, they a rapidly
expanding software company who have seen unprecedented organic growth over
the last couple of years. They sit in a very competitive environment, but
are widely regarded as the bench mark business in their sector, with that
in mind they are about to release a new software product which will blow
the competition away and revolutionise their industry.

They have a team of 30+ talented, eager and innovative Perl developers, who
work solely in an agile environment, and are looking for someone to take
the reigns and lead the team.

You will need a passion for building great products 
Proven track record for leading Development teams (ideally Perl) 
Have managed a team in an agile environment 
Advocate continuous integration 

The most important characteristic is the ability to lead and inspire a
development team, which will include mentoring young developers to help
them achieve their full potential.

It’s a new role and the CTO has stated the successful applicant will help
to define their own role and develop it further, the CTO himself will be
your direct line manager, you will also have a dotted line into the IT
director in the States. 
This isn’t a hands on Perl coding role however you will need to come from a
development background as your main responsibility is to energise and
inspire the future Perl developers, helping their personal development.  As
manager you will be the main point of call for the development team.

This type of opportunity doesn’t come along very often, trying to be
topical whilst blatantly stealing a line from London 2012, if you feel you
can “Inspire a generation” then this is the role for you.
