Job title: Bioinformatician

Company name: Imperial College London

Internal ID: NS 2011 235 DPN

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: 27-39kGBP/yr

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: to August 2014

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Please note that officially the job offer is only 9 months subject to
annual funding renewal.  However, barring any major disasters the project
is funded until 2014.

Applications are invited for a skilled and motivated Bioinformatician to
join an international team working on a highly visible web resource,
VectorBase (http://www.vectorbase.org), serving genomic and functional
genomic data for arthropod vectors of human pathogens.	VectorBase is
currently responsible for five fully annotated genomes (three mosquitoes,
tick and body louse), providing genome search and browse capability, as
well as comparative genomics, genomic variations and gene expression data. 
Annotations for two further species are at the community consultation
stage, and many more vector species and strains are in the pipeline (e.g.
fifteen Anopheles genomes
http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/anopheles).
 
The successful candidate is expected to work closely with vector biologists
at Imperial College and with our collaborators around the world to maintain
and extend the functional genomics and population biology aspects of
VectorBase including the databases, data processing pipelines and web
applications. Experience with biological databases and web development is
essential, and familiarity with vector biology and functional or population
genomics would be highly advantageous.
 
The project operates in a Linux environment and uses primarily open-source
software and bioinformatics databases (e.g. Ensembl, BioMart, BASE and GMOD
Chado). We would expect the successful candidate to both acquire and
contribute to these collaborative efforts; prior experience in one of these
projects would be highly advantageous.

Required skills:
Programming:

SQL (MySQL/Postgres)
Perl
Javascript

Experience:

genomic, bioinformatic or related database and web development

Desired skills:
DBIx + web framework experience (ideally we'd like to port a Ruby web
service to one based on Bio::Chado::Schema, however early attempts were 2x
slower)

Java

API/ORM development

EnsEMBL and/or BioMart

population genetics / genomic variation

next gen sequencing / high throughput genotyping

R

Ruby

high-performance/cluster computing

software development as part of a collaborative project

ontologies and/or semantic web technologies
