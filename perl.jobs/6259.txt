Job title: Perl Programmer

Location: United States, TX, Austin

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I'm looking for someone with a pretty solid understanding of perl and
regular expressions, as well as a basic knowledge of HTML.  This job
involves scraping 4 text fields off a site using regular expressions and
populating a hash table.  This will be repeated across dozens and dozens of
sites (right now I have a queue of something like 80+ sites to scrape). 
For an expert, a typical website scrape implementation should take about 5
mins.

I will provide a perl package for every site you need to scrape, minus the
regular expressions (which is what you'll need to add).  I will also
provide an environment through which you can test your expressions.  All I
need is for you to fill in the contents of the regexps for each site.

In terms of pay, I would like to pay on a per-site basis via some means
like paypal if possible, and the rate is negotiable.  The best thing for us
to do is discuss the situation and, if you're interested, go through a
trial run where I provide the perl code to you and you can scope out the
amount of work.  Afterwards, if all goes well, we can discuss a rate on a
per-site basis.

Also, you will be responsible for your own work environment, as I'm looking
for someone who can work remotely and/or from home.  Since I'm using the
WWW:Mechanize perl package from cpan, so you'll need to have this installed
to perform the work (not included with a standard perl installation to my
knowledge).

FYI, in terms of the future, if all goes well, there is definitely the
potential for more work based on your experience.  Since this is my own
business and my own site, I'm hoping to offload some of my tasks to another
capable, competent perl programmer in a contract role.

Please email me if you're interested with contact information (phone #,
email address, or AIM/ICQ/Gmail/YIM id).

Thanks!
-Dustin
