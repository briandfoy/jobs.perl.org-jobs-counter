Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: All Around The World

Location: Hanover, Germany

Pay rate: competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This is Ovid and I'm looking for two strong Perl developers for a company
in Hanover, Germany. Work permit or Blue Card assistance is provided, along
with a relocation package.
 
The company is a large, stable, profitable business and they've been around
for over a decade. They want strong Perl devs to help them refactor a
legacy system into a modern one. Instead of open plan, the company has two
to three developers per office. Hours are flexible and you'll get sent to
conferences if you want. You'll get the best hardware to hack on and when
you're enjoying Hanover's low cost of living, you'll also get 30 days of
vacation to enjoy the rest of Europe.

Hanover is a beautiful, bike-friendly, mid-sized town in the north of
Germany. The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high. It's a
green-friendly town and hosts one of the largest Oktoberfests in the world.
While we're listing "desired" skills, keep in mind that the company is
happy to be flexible on most of this so long as you can convince them that
you can help improve their systems.

Required skills:
- You speak Perl fluently
- Testing is second nature to you.
- You think 'refactoring' isn't a dirty word.
- You have experience with AJAX, SOAP, REST and other Web technologies.
- You have good relational database experience, preferably MySQL (what a
surprise!)
- You understand that Object Oriented code is more than just using Moose or
blessing a reference.
- Familiarity with Linux
- You speak English.
- You don't drool on your t-shirt.

Desired skills:
- Experience working with large, legacy code bases.
- Speaking German is nice, but not required (the company will help you with
German lessons).
- Appreciating great German beer is nice.
- Familiarity with agile development.
