Job title: Perl Web Site Developer

Company name: CATME Project

Location: United States

Pay rate: based on experience

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
[Note, we can only use US developers for this project. If you are located
outside of the US, we cannot consider you for this position. Principals
only please-- no recruiting firms, outsourcers, etc.]

The CATME Project
(catme.org) is a free educational resource that is loved by users at
hundreds of universities world-wide. We are well-funded via the NSF and
have won multiple awards, including the Premier Award for Excellence in
Educational Software.

We are looking for a developer to continue to add
functionality to the web site to support the project's research goals, as
well as maintain the existing code base and expand and improve the
project's automated testing framework. The position also includes
management and upgrades of the dedicated servers where the project is
housed, as well as acting as "third tier" troubleshooting support when user
issues crop up. The project is developed primarily in mod_perl running in
Apache on a Linux platform. The back-end database is Postgres.

Our
database contains student and faculty data for hundreds of educational
institutions world-wide. The security and privacy of our users is
paramount. Be prepared to discuss your experience with secure coding and
best practices for web application security.

This is a telecommute
position with flexible hours, but we are looking for a "full-time"
developer in terms of commitment level. You would work as a sub-contractor
under the current grant funding, with the expectation that you would take
over as primary contractor on future grant proposals.

Desired skills:
mod_perl
CSS
jQuery
Postgres
Apache
Linux
git
Selenium
