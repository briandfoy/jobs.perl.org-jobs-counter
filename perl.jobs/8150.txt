Job title: freelance mod_perl/DBI programmer

Company name: Barkani

Internal ID: N/A

Location: United States, New Jersey

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: Ongoing

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Looking for a freelancer to do site development and ongoing site and server
maintenance.

We're developing sites using mod_perl, masonry, ajax, postgres, and apache,
on a debian server.

I need someone who can build a server and develop the sites from scratch
using the above technologies. (Oracle and MySQL would be nice as well). 

The more hours you can give me, the better. I have a backlog of projects I
need to work through.

Required skills:
Mod_perl, PostgreSQL, Apache, Debian, HTML, AJAX, CGI, etc.

This is not an intro position. You'll be expected to hit the floor running
from day one. There will be limited support from other team members but
mostly to point you in the right direction.

Desired skills:
Oracle and MySQL would be nice. Some basic Photoshop and Flash would help
but not necessary.

I also have an immediate need to install ftp with pgp encryption.
