Job title:
Mid-Level and Senior Perl Developers needed

Company name: Quality Humans, Inc. (for Amazon)

Location: United States, WA, Seattle

Pay rate: USD $60-75/hr or $90-110K/yr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 2-3 months, some perm

Hours: Full time

Description:
We met with a really nice Amazon employee, named Paul, on March 21. He
needs 2 reasonably good OO Perl contractors as soon as possible. He also
has long-term needs for solid OO Perl employees.

The contractor positions are estimated to last 2-3 months. Actual length
may vary with work load and other personnel considerations (these positions
may be replaced by, or become, or work side-by-side with full-time
positions that we're also looking for).

For the contractor positions, it would be best if you live in (or move to)
Seattle. However, for the right people, we may be able to pay for your
travel home often, so you could work in Seattle and live elsewhere.

Required skills:
For contract positions: At least 2 years OO Perl, 4 years LAMP
technologies.
For perm positions: At least 4 years OO Perl, 6 years LAMP technologies,
and formal CS education.
