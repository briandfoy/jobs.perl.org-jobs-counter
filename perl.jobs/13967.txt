currently seeking highly qualified and motivated Senior Operations

staff distributed around the globe. We’re interested in the best

	* Real-time data replication and High Availability
    - Experience processing XML and JSON documents
    - Template Toolkit and HTML::Template is desired
    - Experience with User Interface design, particularly focused on
technical users
    - Strong focus on Development Testing at all levels
    - Knowledge of the Domain Name System (DNS) and BIND configuration.
    - FreeBSD and Linux experience
    - Strong written and oral communications skills
    - The ability to collaborate with diverse and distributed teams

Desired skills:
- Unix system administration skills, especially FreeBSD and Linux
    - Cisco IOS System Maintenance (install/troubleshooting/upgrade)
    - Familiarity with firewalls and common security best practices
    - Familiarity with virtualization, VMWare a plus

    - In-depth knowledge of DNS and DHCP
    - Experience with DNSSEC
    - C, C++, or Python Programming Experience
    - Strong Network Management background

This position requires open-minded, motivated, hands-on individuals who
thrive in an environment comprised of strong engineering and
multidisciplinary teams having both software development and systems
administration backgrounds. Candidates must possess a desire to pioneer
solutions and automation over existing and new services that empower the
core of the Internet.
