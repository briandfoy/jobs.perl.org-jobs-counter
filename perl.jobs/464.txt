Dear Sir/Ma'am,
This is with reference to your requirement for Bioinformatics 
Programmer in Perl. I am currently looking for a suitable opening 
in bioinformatics. I describe myself as the jack of all trades and 
the master of some good ones.


I have solid working experience in Unix, C, C++, VB, Java, Oracle, 
SQL Server. All my projects have been executed following the 
procedures of SDLC. Besides, most of the projects have been 
documented by me right upto user manual. Part of my job involved 
system administration and DBA. I have good working knowledge of 
Biostatistics, BioXML, BioPerl, BioJava and Genetic algorithms.


I am currently concentrating on datawarehousing, datamining and 
Bioinformatics.


Having handled software projects in various capacities and at 
different locations with diverse teams. I feel I can take this 
reponsibility of working on bioinformatics projects.


I am enclosing my resume for your kind persual. Looking forward to 
an early response.


Thanking you,
