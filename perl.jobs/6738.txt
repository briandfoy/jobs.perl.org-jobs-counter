Job title: ETL Software Engineer

Company name: Ask.com (IAC Search and Media)

Internal ID: *3DF1E279E25A35D7

Location: United States, CA, Oakland

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Every now and then, you get the itch to grab a few terabytes of data and
run it through a wood chipper, apply a few regular expressions, and find
frequent patterns the mess that remains. 

You download CPAN modules just to see how that guy did it. 

You think that reading a book on multi-dimensional search tree sounds like
a nice way to spend an evening. 

You would never, ever, change a hash while inside a while each loop, except
that one time when it was funny. 

You are not afraid of databases. Really, really big databases. The kinds
that make Oracle throw up its hands and go home.  Matter of fact, you might
just go ahead and write a better database. Over the weekend. 

You think a fire hose of clickstream data is sexy, and playing with a
real-time traffic multicast of a top-tier search engine is something you’d
like to get paid for. 

Ask.com is looking for an experienced Software Engineer to join a team
responsible for business critical data capturing and reporting. We develop
tools that make sense of a never-ending stream of data, slice, dice, and
summarize it all. We write in C and very tight Perl, and SQL is our puppy.
Bits of Java and Ruby lying around, too, if you want to play with those.

Responsibilities

    * Design and build software that implements click stream tracking for a
collection of web sites accessed by 10’s of millions of people.
    * Build, and maintain an ETL system used for reporting on business
critical site metrics.
    * Develop and maintain internal tools designed to aid productivity.
    * Handle production issues on a system that stretches across the globe.

    * Maintain/Expand existing reporting systems and analysis tools.
    * Work on ad-hoc information requests from groups world-wide.
    * Participate in third-party software evaluation.
    * Serve as a resource for development on other team projects and
products as needed. 

Required skills:
Perl expertise, specifically in relation to: regular expressions,
intercommunications with databases (Oracle) using DBI, XML, and module
development.

Experience using C

Desired skills:
UNIX shell scripting (bash).
UNIX administration skills a plus.
Java/C++ programming a plus.
