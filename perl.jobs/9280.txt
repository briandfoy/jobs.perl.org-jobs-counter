Job title: Agile perl developer

Company name: AirWave

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
ok( $you->enjoy_problem_solving() ); 
ok( $you->strive_for_simplicity() ); 
ok( $you->write_tests_first() ); 
ok( $you->want_to_enjoy_your_job() ); 

Do you pass these tests? If so, you should be writing software at Airwave 
Wireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of
our 
time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback loops
speak 
louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings. We
practice 
test-driven development and have a comprehensive suite of tests... over
31,000 
at last count. We pair program, so you'll learn the system quickly and have
a 
great time doing it. We have short release cycles, which means your talents

won't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of day.
Software you 
write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a couple of 
weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP project in the

industry (six years and counting), so we have gotten quite good at
embracing 
XP's advantages while avoiding its pitfalls. 

Personally, I enjoy working at Airwave more than any job I've ever had. I
am 
excited to come into work every day, I work hard for eight hours solving 
challenging problems, and then go home to lead a well balanced life outside

of work. When I'm at work I get to interact closely with a group that is 
brilliant, funny, motivated, and inspiring. I spend most of the day
smiling, 
laughing, and learning. The team we've built is truly a special group, and
I'm 
proud and honored to be a part of it. 

Excited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. Airwave developers write software
in 
several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux
systems. We 
use Apache mod_perl2 for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for our back-end 
persistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge of network 
protocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP. 

Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task, but our products help to
ease 
that burden. We build network management software that is used by many of
the 
leading IT organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major universities, 
hospitals, and other prominent institutions. Our industry-leading software
helps 
plan, configure, manage, and monitor some of the largest wireless networks
on 
the planet.
