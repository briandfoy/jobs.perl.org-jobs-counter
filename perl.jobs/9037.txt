Job title:
Software Developer - High Throughput Gene Targeting

Company name: Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute

Internal ID: 80297

Location:
United Kingdom, Cambridgeshire, Cambridge

Pay rate: £27,316 to £37,690 per annum

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 2.5 years

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Scientific programming / bioinformatics: developing / extending the
software supporting a molecular biology lab, running two large-scale
international projects (EUCOMM - www.eucomm.org and KOMP -
www.knockoutmouse.org). Between them, these programs aim to create a
library of ES cells knockouts for over half the mouse genome. We make
pragmatic technology choices, and we work closely with our lab’s molecular
biologists to make our software effective. Our software ranges from
plate-tracking to sequence analysis to data marts, often with Ajax-driven
web front ends. An example of some of our software can be found here:
www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt.

Required skills:
Object-oriented Perl programming over relational databases.
Good working knowledge of SQL.
We use Catalyst and Template Toolkit and Prototype/Jquery to get our jobs
done, but lots of experience of these is not critical.

Desired skills:
A working knowledge of other OO languages and frameworks used in
server-side development (e.g. Java, Spring) would be welcome. If you have
experience with server-side frameworks (such as Catalyst and Template
Toolkit), and / or Javascript toolkits (such as Prototype or JQuery), this
would be an advantage. A qualification in Biological computing is not
essential but an interest in the science and willingness to learn fast is
key. The campus runs frequent courses to allow staff to augment their
technical skills.
