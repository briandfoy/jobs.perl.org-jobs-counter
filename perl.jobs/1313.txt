Job title: RT Hacker

Company name: Best Practical Solutions, LLC

Internal ID: perl.org-1

Location: United States, MA, Somerville

Pay rate: DOE (Please send requirements)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Best Practical Solutions is the maker of "RT", an enterprise-grade issue
tracking solution.  We're a growing, entirely bootstrap-funded,  opensource
company.  We're looking for skilled contractors to work on a number of
current and upcoming projects, both internal and for our customers.

Required skills:
RT is over 100,000 lines of object oriented perl and HTML::Mason templates.
We need folks who can dive right into our code and build new functionality
to spec with minimal handholding.  If you've not worked with large,
existing codebases, html templating systems and SQL databases, this might
not be the right job for you.

Desired skills:
Ideally, we're looking for folks who have worked with RT in the past, but
if your experience with large perl projects doesn't include RT, that's not
a showstopper. Tell us about what you _have_ done and what you're most
proud of. 

URL for more information: http://bestpractical.com/

Contact information:
Please send a cover letter, resume, salary requirements, pointers to sample
code (if it's on CPAN, just tell us your CPAN author id) and all the rest
of the usual claptrap to:

   resumes (at) bestpractical.com

We'd strongly prefer that your resume be in ascii text, but if all you've
got is html, pdf or MS Word, send it along.
