Job title: Senior Perl Developers

Company name: Pictage.com

Location: United States, CA, Torrance

Pay rate: Market competitive + equity

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: At-will

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Professional photographers shoot the pictures and Pictage does the rest.
From the online shopping cart to the actual production and fulfillment of
photo products - Pictage is a one stop shop for professsional
photographers.

With a directory of thousands of professional photographers (the majority
of whom are wedding photographers) uploading tens of thousands of events
per year, Pictage now boasts big company revenue, but still  maintains a
start-up atmosphere. 

We plan to completely redesign/rearchitect the current website (for reasons
that are obvious to anyone that visits) and are building a senior team to
execute that vision. The specs are being written - now we need some
engineers.

We're looking for senior perl developers with prior experience building
high volume, transactional websites. If you don't have prior .com
experience this probably isn't the right job for you.

Compensation will include market competitive salaries + equity. We are
focused on providing an enjoyable, professional, low drama work
environment, and a healthy work/life balance.


Required skills:
* Exceptional communication skills 
* 4+ years Perl/mod_perl experience
* 3+ years Linux experience
* 2+ years in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Ajax etc. 
* Skilled in developing dynamic, object oriented, web applications 
* Apache, UNIX/Linux, Mason, Postgres DB

Desired skills:
* Famiarity with Java
* Familiarity with Agile development concepts
* Understanding of statistics (we are a quantitative decision making
organization which will do a lot of A/B and multi-variant testing)
