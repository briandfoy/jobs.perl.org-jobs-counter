mySQL database development experience in a LAMP environment. The developer
needs to be comfortable working in a fast-moving environment as well as
working on a variety of assignments and technologies. People who are used

well.

• Designing and developing new site features and enhancements to the
existing system
• Helping to refine and extend the site’s technical architecture
• Refining business requirements for new site features
• Integrating new features with the existing site
• Providing support for developed applications 

This is a hands-on development position requiring the following:

• Top-notch Perl development skills (esp. object-oriented Perl) and some
experience with PHP. Please do not apply if you do not meet this
requirement.
• At least three years experience in software development (with at least
two years in web application development), with exposure to the full
development lifecycle required
• Solid understanding of Apache operations and integration.
• Understanding of developing with the mySQL platform
• Solid understanding of Linux (Red Hat Enterprise or 2.6 kernel
preferred).
• Experience working with open-source tools and applications
• Experience in one or more of the following technologies: content
management; search engines; on-line registration systems; and content
personalization
• Experience with Autonomy search technologies a plus
• Working knowledge of XML, CSS, and DHTML
• Strong organizational, problem-solving and communications skills (must be
able to do basic technical writing)
• Experience in on-line media operations or advertising highly desirable
• Ability to work in a rapidly changing environment and exhibit grace under
pressure
