Job title:
web/database programmer for biological system

Company name: Cold Spring Harbor Lab

Internal ID: 00002

Location: United States, NY, Cold Spring Harbor

Pay rate: $60,000-$80,000US

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Tired of writing yet another accounting/business system?  Tired of having
the marketing department write your "specs"?  Tired of pointy-haired bosses
and Dilbert-like work environments with little challenge or meaningful
work?

How about a job writing Perl for plant biologists?  How about working other
Perl nuts on completely open-source projects?  Then you should apply for a
job with Gramene, a federally funded database that integrates and presents
genomic data for researchers studying crop grasses (e.g., rice, wheat,
maize, barley -- you know, grains you eat).

Hacking rice desn't sound exciting?  Well, consider this:  Rice is possibly
the oldest domesticated grain (~10,000 years) and is the staple food for
2.5 billion people.  Cultivation of rice is the largest single use of land
for producing food, covering 9% of the earth's arable land.  Rice provides
21% of global human per capita energy and 15% of per capital protein.
[http://www.gramene.org/oryza/rice_intro.html]

This is no maintenance programming position.  Our small team of developers
writes lots of new programs for everything from web-accessible databases to
custom programs that analyze complex data for biologists.  We write just
about everything in Perl and release just about everything under GPL.

We'd like to find people who love Perl, MySQL and other open-source
software.  It would be great if you knew some biology (you need to at least
*like* it), but our preference is someone with good systems skills like
tuning and maintaining MySQL, managing Linux systems, etc. 

Responsibilities

You will work within our group of developers and data curators to determine
features needed to be implemented in database and software under
development, providing feedback on feasibility, scope of work and time
requirements, write specifications, and determine implementation timelines.


Almost every application we write uses a database of some sort, so you will
need to be versed in designing and working with databases and their APIs.

You will develop web applications for users to access the data in
databases.  Some of our applications present data visually, such as our
comparative map viewer (http://www.gramene.org/cmap/) or our genome browser
(http://www.gramene.org/Oryza_sativa/), but most are search interfaces that
present data in HTML/XML/tab formats. 

Please submit your resume and a representative code sample for
consideration. 

Required skills:
Perl, SQL, Unix/Linux

Master's degree in Computer Science, or related field plus a minimum of 4
years experience, or Bachelor's degree plus a minimum of 5 years experience
as a software engineer performing duties similar to those above.

Database experience includes database design, development, and/or
object-relational modeling, database adminstration.

Web programming experience includes writing static and dynamic web pages,
templates,


Desired skills:
CVS, Apache, Javascript, XML, CGI, web/database programming,
familiarity with basic concepts of molecular biology and
bioinformatics.
