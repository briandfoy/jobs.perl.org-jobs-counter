compliance with all applicable state and federal laws prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of race, color, age, sex, religion, national
origin, disability, veteran's status, or any other class protected by

Required skills:
* 5+ years professional programming experience with Perl 5; Experience with
Perl Best Practices and PerlCritic; Experience or familiarity with the
following modules: Try::Tiny, Class::Load, XML::LibXML, Test::More,
Test::Exception; Experience with creating unit tests.
* 4+ years professional experience working with relational databases (SQL),
MySQL a plus in a highly transactional environment.
* General experience with MVC patterns, ORMs, Web Services
(client/servers).
* HTML and CSS skills to create templates for web.
* Experience with (and troubleshooting) Javascript (jQuery specifically)
for DOM manipulation and AJAX interactions.
* Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in an
exacting manner.
* Effectively able to handle multiple priorities and manage time
efficiently to deliver projects of varying size.
* Must have excellent communication skills both written and oral.

Desired skills:
* Test Driven Development (TDD). Experience developing automated functional
and performance testing suites.
* Experience with Agile software development practices (e.g. Scrum,
Lean/Kanban).
* Experience with Perl Template Toolkit.
* Ability and willingness to train/mentor junior developers.
* Linux knowledge. Comfortable in a command line environment.
* E-commerce experience.
* Published CPAN modules.
* Experience with a common Perl web framework, such as Catalyst, Dancer, or
