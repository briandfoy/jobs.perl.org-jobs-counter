Subject: Looking for contract/perm in Florida or elsewhere
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: chip@chipcastle.com (Chip Castle)

Looking for contract or permanent work close to
Destin, Florida, which is located between Pensacola and
Panama City Beach, but can telecommute anywhere and will
travel for the right contract opportunity.

Advanced Perl programmer experienced with a wide variety of
modules, including but not limited to DBI, CGI, LWP, GD, Mail,
Text, File, Tie, Date, HTTP, HTML and a few of my own custom
modules.

Relational database experience includes MySQL and Postgres SQL.

In addition to Perl, my skills include PHP, Apache, mod_perl
(beginner), Linux systems administration, SQL Windows (4GL),
Unix shell (bash, tcsh) and C.

Of course, I am willing to learn anything. :)

Resume available at http://www.chipcastle.com/resume.html

Thanks!
