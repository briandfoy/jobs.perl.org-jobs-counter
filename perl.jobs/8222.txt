Job title:
Telecommute Position For Healthcare ASP in New York

Company name: Medikin Incorporated

Location: United States, New York, New York

Pay rate: $20/hr

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: long term

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
If you are looking for a long-term position which gives you the flexibility
to work from your current location, and if you choose to respond
_PLEASE_ANSWER_ALL_ of the questions posed at the end of the desired skills
section of this post.

Medikin Incorporated is a Healthcare IT company based in New York City.
More specifically we are a TASP or Transcription ASP. Our software
automates the daily workflow for more than 100 medical transcription
companies. We've been in business since 2002.

We have a number of projects which we would like to implement in the near
future, so we are looking for approximately two eager developers to become
an integral part of our development team. The technical requirements for
the positions are as follows:


Required skills:
   1. PERL / CGI - the more experience the better since the application is
written almost entirely in PERL.
   2. Familiarity with cross platform development for Windows, Mac and
Linux
   3. Familiarity with best practices in application development,
documentation, etc.
   4. Ability to understand and unwind spaghetti code. See number 2 above.
We are working towards that.
   5. Not an absolute requirement but a very strong plus - Familiarity with
Windows interfacing technologies such as either ASP.NET, Java or C#
   5. Not an absolute requirement but a strong plus - Familiarity with AJAX

Desired skills:
A. Project management in software development. We are looking for a team
leader who has demonstrated skills in this area.
B. Familiarity with PostgreSQL is a plus. Advanced DBA skills would be
great so that we can optimize queries and keep the database well tuned.
C. Sysadmin skills with the LAMP stack. We have a full-time sysadmin so
we're not expecting the candidate to stray too much from development work.
This is more for backup and occasional loadbalancing of our sysadmin.
D. Speaking of backup and loadbalancing, we're aiming to build our app into
a bulletproof ASP, so we're investigating various high availability and
scalability solutions such as replication and clustering. If you have
familiarity with clustering, load-balancing, replication or
point-in-time-recovery solutions that will be a major plus.

The work also involves second-level support, which means you would be
responsible for fixing bugs and communicating with our support staff.
Therefore clear written and spoken English skills and a customer-care
approach are valued as well.

Being available around the clock is a plus. We rarely have major incidents
and don't expect everyone to be on call 24/7. However, our application,
although it is utilized mostly during business hours, has to be online and
working 24/7; so our staff must understand and be OK with the duties that
come with being a critical part of our team.

If this seems like an interesting opportunity to you, let me know why you
believe you are a good candidate, and specifically let me know:

   1. your availability – when you can start and if there are any
impediments to your working full-time or on a long-term basis
   2. your desired work status – are you looking for project work or a
long-term affiliation, full-time or part-time work, remote teleworking or
work in our office
   3. if you may work remotely - where you will work from (home, cybercafe,
an office?) and whether you have reliable Internet access and a
sufficiently disturbance-free (office quality) atmosphere in that location.

   4. your compensation requirements.

We are interested in developers whose telecommuting arrangement enables
them to be well satisfied at a rate far lower than the going rates for
experienced developers in New York City. We're interested in meeting local
folks as well, but cost is always a concern and is the primary reason we
are willing to consider remote workers.

When formulating your reply please be sure to respond to each of the points
above, and please attach your resume as well. Although I have seen it
already I'm emailing several individuals and I would like to have your
resume in-line with your response.
