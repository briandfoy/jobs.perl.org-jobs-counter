Subject: Seeking Telecommuting Perl Job
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: adbrownlee@hotmail.com ("Amy Brownlee")

My name is Amy Brownlee and I am seeking work as a Web Developer utilizing 
Perl, MySQL, and HTML.  I live in Graham, North Carolina and I want to 
telecommute 100%.  I have written a Perl script, login.pl, which take user 
ID, pin and password info, from a HTML form and then validates that they are 
in a MYSQL table.  Valid members will be sent to register.html to complete 
the registration process. Members that are not in the table are taken to a 
sorry.html page. Register.pl is another Perl script that I have written.  It 
takes registration info from an HTML form, creates a record in a MySQL 
table, and sends an email to an administrator.  Ordertrack.pl is another 
Perl script that I have written that retrieves a customer's order shipping 
info when they enter their order number into the tracking number field on an 
HTML page.  It then searches a MYSQL table and generates an HTML page 
display their shipping info with a link to the UPS website. If the order 
number is not in the table then an invalid order number HTML page is 
generated.

My salary is negotiable. I can be reached by email at 
amybrownlee@triad.rr.com or after 6pm at 336-570-0242.

My resume is available here:
http://home.triad.rr.com/amyresume/resume.html

Thank you,

Amy Brownlee
