Job title: Student Intern $5,000 12 weeks 

Company name: Community Software Lab

Location: United States, MA, Lowell 

Pay rate: $5,000 / 12 weeks 

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 12 weeks

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
MVHub is a web based database for social services. Contacts for agencies
and programs can maintain their own records and are encouraged to do so
with periodic email reminders. Searchers can use natural language search
terms like "food" or "shelter". Two sites are running MVHub software,
MVHub.com and NorthShorePort.org

We seek a summer intern to do web development in Perl , SQL , HTML and (a
tiny bit) of Javascript to improve the MVHub software.

To be eligible for this internship, you must:
a. Have been a student on April 25th
b. Be willing to be paid for accomplishing specific results instead of by
the hour.

Given the vagaries of software project estimating and the relatively low
wage (b) is problematic for many people. Your judgment may be influenced by
knowing that this internship exists in large part to provide a paid
learning opportunity.

Full details at:

http://wiki.thecsl.org/mediawiki/index.php/Pseudo_GSOC

Please don't blindly send a resume, that is not how we want you to apply.


Required skills:
We work mostly in Perl. You can probably get by with some small training or
experience in one of the other scripting languages. (Python, PHP, LISP,
Ruby, TCL, etc)

Our software is web based. Ideally you will have experience in web
development with Perl. At a minimum, you need to read the HTML reference
and understand the difference between an <hr> tag and a <ul> tag.

If you don't have or can't get enough knowledge of Launchpad.net to submit
a merge request adding yourself to the appropriate place in the
CONTRIBUTORS file, you will not be able to get up to speed quickly enough
to be productive with this summer and we will (reluctantly) reject your
application. 

Desired skills:
CGI::Application 
HTML::Template
