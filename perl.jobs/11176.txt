Job title: Perl programmers wanted - Full Time Telecommute

Company name: Ionzero 

Internal ID: CatalystPerl

Location: United States, CO, Fort Collins

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months to perm

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We're growing again!  Ionzero is looking for more good Perl developers.  

Ionzero is a software development consultancy company. We have customers
around the US and around the world. Our job is to figure out how our
customers' software can be better, and then make it so.  We set out to
create
the kind of company we always wanted to work for where there were good
people,
interesting projects, solid software and flexible (and reasonable) hours.
We've accomplished that for the last 6 years and now our business is
expanding
faster than ever before.

We work in many languages (Perl, PHP, Java, whatever our customers need)
but
right now we are looking for programmers with Perl experience.	If you know

modern tools such as Moose, Catalyst and DBIx::Class, great.  If not, learn
with us!
Familiarity with CPAN is a must. 

Our clients are all over the place, so you need to be able to work well via

email and our project management system.  Since it's a telecommute 
position, you must be self motivated and we expect that if you say you 
will do something, you will. If you can do that and write good solid code, 

we want to talk to you. 

This is a contract-to-perm telecommute position. We have staff all over
the world. If you're nearby, all the better. The position is contract to
start, with the possibility go permanent.

If this all sounds good to you, send a resume along with sample code and
your salary requirements.

Required skills:
* Perl software for web applications

* SQL databases (particularly MySQL and Postgresql)

* Familiarity with CPAN

* Web technologies such as HTML / CSS / Javascript

* Version control (SVN / Git / etc.)


Desired skills:
* Modern Perl (and Object Oriented tools like Moose)

* Catalyst web framework

* DBIx::Class. 

* Familiarity with other languages such as php, javascript, etc. are all
beneficial

* Spanish language skills a plus
