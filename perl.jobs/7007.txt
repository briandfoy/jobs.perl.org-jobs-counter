Description:
AlertSite is currently seeking a Software Developer with at least 3 years

against you, but development is performed exclusively on Linux.  You should
be at home on Linux, BSD, or Unix variants.  

Required skills:
Requirements: 
3+ years programming in Perl in a Linux environment 
SQL experience (we use MySQL) 
HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, CGI and web development experience 
Full project life cycle experience

Strong attention to detail
