Job title: Perl Website Developer

Company name: www.skoosh.com

Location: United Kingdom, East Sussex, Brighton

Pay rate: £30k - £45k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Based in central Brighton, but very much with an international focus,
Skoosh is an ambitious and dynamic online travel agency specialising in
hotels. Despite our relatively small size we compete directly with the
largest travel companies in the world with an innovative range of
technology and marketing skills. Our ambition is to set ourselves apart
from the rest by doing 'everything better'. Indeed, in everything we do, we
aim to improve on what's already out there.

Job Description:
Integrating our in-house booking engine with third party suppliers is core
to our business. Doing it well has always given us a competitive advantage
and enabled us to compete head-to-head with the largest travel companies in
the world. 

Previously a role we’ve managed offshore we now want to bring it in-house
so that the developer can communicate directly with suppliers and
understand and contribute better to the business potential.

As well as being a talented programmer you will also have an interest in
business generally, and ecommerce specifically, as you will be working
directly with our suppliers to improve sales.

In your covering letter please include:
- Details of elegant solutions you've found for tricky issues.
- An explanation of your interest in business.

Required skills:
We code in Perl, so we're looking for at least 3 years experience
developing in Perl or similar language and object-orientated programming.
Experience of MySQL and database design principles.

Desired skills:
We use: apache2, mod_perl2, nginx, RHEL5, bash, svn, perl5, AnyEvent, Coro,
XHTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, MySQL, Redis/Memcached, Sphinx search engine.

Hotel or travel industry knowledge useful but not essential.
