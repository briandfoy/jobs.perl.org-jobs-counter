Description:

What do you do when data sources are larger than you've ever seen, less
structured than you thought possible, and arrive without documentation? We
write elegant, transportable code that scales. We leverage clusters, SANs
and other high-end hardware configurations, but to maximize the speed and
performance of our applications we optimize and fine tune complex scripts
on UNIX and Linux systems. We are often called upon to reformat and
separate data for a variety of uses, and expect flexibility and creativity
to accommodate evolving requirements. How you can help:


Required skills:
How you can help:
*	Develop custom scripts (Perl, Awk, Bash, shell, Python, etc.) to
cleanse, transform and normalize very large, often unstructured
multi-format data sets. 
*	Analyze the data once it is inside a database or custom file
solution to perform pattern analysis. 
*	Explore new ways to manipulate and parse a variety of formats.
*	Use text parsing languages and transformations, complex data
structures and statistical analysis to guide, develop and support follow-on
processes.
*	Scale, scale, scale!


Desired skills:
Qualifications:

*	Experience with scripting in Linux/Unix environments (CLI).
*	Ability to munge data, analyze it within and outside of databases,
and extract salient features.
*	Demonstrated experience on very large data sets, preferably from
many sources.
*	Expertise distributing jobs across clusters and demonstrated
aptitude for compiling results. NFS!
*	Applicants must be U.S. citizens and selected applicants will be
subject to a government security investigation and must meet eligibility
requirements for access to classified information. Current Top Secret
clearance strongly preferred.
*	BS in CS preferred.
