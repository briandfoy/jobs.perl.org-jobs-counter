Job title: Portal job

Company name: Aaronsen Group, Ltd.

Internal ID: EC4

Location: United States, PA, Pittsburgh

Pay rate: $50/hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I need three highly skilled developers to crank out a My Yahoo! clone for
use as a corporate portal.

You'll be slaving for 2 months to put together existing pieces of software
as well as to create new software.  If you're not in Pittsburgh, I'll fly
you here and put you up.  I'll provide you with working space and machines,
and every comfort necessary to focus your brain solely on the project.	The
caffeine will flow heavily.

You'll be working under mod_perl with DBI, LDAP, probably template toolkit,
FreeBSD, lots of modules, and other things as necessary.

Note that the requirement is for skilled *developers*, not just straight
coders/hackers.  This means you have to be able to deal with other
developers, which are human.  You must also be able to work within a
project framework, handle interfaces, and deal with code documentation. 
And most importantly, you must understand that the job is not to code a
righteous hack, but to satisfy a client.


Required skills:
Perl coding
DBI (for MySQL or Postgres)
LDAP
LWP
FreeBSD
Installation and use of random modules
You must allow nothing to get in your way.


Desired skills:

Email info@aaronsen.com with your pleading and your resume.  I expect to
see direct experience with Perl and Unix.
