Job title:
Experienced Perl Developer sought by successful and established internet
start-up

Company name: Lokku

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: c. £45,000

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Lokku is seeking an experienced, talented and forward-thinking Perl
professional to add seniority and expertise to their thriving and ambitious
team.  If you'd like a key role in an exciting and evolving internet
company, and have enthusiasm and dedication in abundance, then please keep
reading.

	  
The Role:
 
We have a closely-knit engineering team that builds and maintains the
software that runs our primary brand, Nestoria, and drives our product
evolution forwards.  Never a company to sit back and enjoy the status quo,
we have an abundance of exciting projects and product developments sitting
in our pipeline crying out to be brought into fruition.  By adding another
experienced Perl Developer to the team, we will be increasing our capacity
to drive forward with our ambitious development roadmap.

Your role will not be restricted to any one part of the code base; you will
work on projects which range from backend processing and internal tools to
the interactive website and its heavily customised search-time code. 
Additionally you will be encouraged to work closely with the more junior
members of the team and to share your knowledge and experience with them.


About Lokku:

Lokku is a small web company based in Clerkenwell, central London.  Our
primary brand Nestoria is a vertical search engine in the real estate
market.  We work to deliver a great user experience to house hunters in
eight countries and in six languages.  

We like to give something back to the technology communities we're involved
in, and are especially keen on contributing to the Perl (CPAN) and
Geo-spatial open source development communities. We make our API available
to developers, are frequent sponsors of relevant events and operate Geomob
London, a quarterly meetup for geo and mobile enthusiasts.

Required skills:
Maybe you are looking to make the move to a tech team which embraces the
principles of clean code, best practice development methodologies, and
user-centred product planning.	Perhaps you crave a senior role in a
smaller, tightly-knit team which affords you a higher degree of
responsibility and a more diverse range of juicy projects to work on.  Or
maybe you’re a start-up junkie, or have always wondered what life would be
like in a thriving tech start-up.  

We are relaxed about your personal motivations, as long as you have the
following:
      
•	2+ years’ experience as a professional Perl programmer
•	Strong knowledge of Perl best practices and modern Perl development
practices
•	Experience with SQL databases and accessing them in Perl (we use
MySQL and DBI)
•	Knowledge of Apache, mod_perl, and web frameworks (we use
HTML::Mason)
•	Experience developing on and for Linux platforms (we use Debian
Linux)
•	Good understanding of test-driven development and the Perl Test::
module namespace
•	Experience using  version control systems in a team environment (we
use Subversion)
•	Excellent technical communication skills and a desire to coach,
mentor and share your experience with junior team members

Desired skills:
It is also desirable but not essential that you have the following:

•	Knowledge of modern client-side web technologies (JavaScript,
jQuery, AJAX, CSS)
•	Ability to write and maintain C code (parts of our search system
are written in C)
•	Experience with writing systems which have to scale to large
numbers of users, database rows, etc.
•	Experience with internationalization and character encoding in Perl
and MySQL
•	Knowledge of Moose, Devel::NYTProf, CHI
