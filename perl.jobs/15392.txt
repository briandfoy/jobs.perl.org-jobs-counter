Job title: Perl/CGI Web Developer Contract

Company name: WebScheduler LLC

Location: Lafayette, CA, United States

Pay rate: competitive

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
WebScheduler LLC / SurgiScheduler Description:

webscheduler is looking for
an experienced perl developer to inherit the code base of webscheduler.net,
a 20 year old profitable business to business subscription-based web
application.

You will be paid for the opportunity to get familiar with the
code base. We're looking to establish a long-term relationship that
requires occasional part-time development work.
Understanding the existing
code is more important than the impulse/ability to rewrite it.
Months may
pass between assignments.

The existing app has a solid structure. You will
be modifying the existing app, not rewriting it wholesale (until it makes
business sense to do so).
To date we have not outgrown the original design.

New customers can be added and configured without developer involvement.
If a new customer requests (and is willing to pay for the mods) features
not present in the app, you would be called on to estimate the extent of
the modification before performing them.

The application runs on a single
FreeBSD 7.2 server in a managed hosting account

There are 4 mysql
databases with a total 400MB of data in the databases. The largest db has
200 MB of data and the largest table has 400k rows with most tables under
10k rows. There are 20 database tables per customer.

You will work with an
experienced sysadmin.

You will be expected to setup a local dev site for
your personal development and testing. Choice of source control and
development tools are left to you. We use git for producing daily diffs of
what changed in the customer database tables.

Webscheduler is a virtual
company with the principals located in the SF bay area (East Bay) and you
will be required to travel for an initial meeting with the Managing
Partner. After that initial meeting, telecommuting is OK and the norm.

Desired skills:
Specific required and/or desired skills:
PERL CGI - 
DBI::MySQL - 
Knowledge of anonymous hashes and dereferencing them -
