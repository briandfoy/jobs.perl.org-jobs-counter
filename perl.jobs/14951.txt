Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Booking.com

Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Booking.com BV (the company behind Booking.com™, the market leading online
hotel reservation service in the world) is looking for Perl Developer who
is passionate about their craft, who thrives on challenge and who believes
in success through collaboration. Whether it is hardening Perl's hash
function or developing efficient serialization libraries, we solve serious
problems using Perl.

We offer an international, result-driven, fun, and dynamic environment. If
scale and complexity excite you, Booking is the place to B!

B.responsible

Our technical culture derives strongly from our strong ties to the Perl
community. We appreciate what open source means both for our business and
also for internal projects. Some of our most useful hacks inside the
company have come from someone scratching the proverbial itch. We are
actively engaged and enjoy the benefits our culture produces such as
increased communication between each other and also to our business
counterparts.

As a Software Developer, you are responsible for the development,
performance, and scaling of our public website as well as internal systems,
which includes using: Perl (5.14), DBI, Mason, Moose, Sereal, Plack, nginx,
Javascript, MySQL, Memcached, Redis, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, git, and CentOS
Linux. You will work independently and will also be responsible for making
technical decisions within a team. Our development strategy is agile and we
work in small Scrum teams of 5-7. We do several rollouts every day. We are
data-driven and do extensive A/B testing.

Even without Perl experience, your colleagues will help you get up to speed
in order to be able to start solving real problems from day one.

Important aspects of the job include:

Rapidly develop next-generation scalable, flexible, and high-performance
systems.
Solve issues with the site and internal systems, prioritizing based on
customer impact
Act as an intermediary for problems, with both technical and non-technical
audiences
Collaborate with the team, Team Leaders and Product Owners to prioritize
projects

Required skills:
B.skilled

Sometimes, solving our toughest problems had little to do with the software
we had written, and more to do with the complex interaction of multiple
systems. Understanding the full stack, from bits going across the wire to
the various protocols that define communication all the way up to the
application layer is vitally important. Most of us know multiple languages
and have worked on multiple platforms. We need self-starters who are great
at solving problems, who initiate solutions and discussions and who believe
that any challenge can be scaled with the right mindset and tools.

We have found that people who match the following requirements are the ones
who fit us best:

- 4 years of hardcore development experience with Perl and other
programming language
- Experience of developing in and contributing to open source
- Ability to work independently in small teams
- Experience with HTTP and server-side technologies (web servers, database
servers)
- Preferably university degree in Mathematics or Software Engineering

B.offered

We are a performance-based company that offers career advancement and
lucrative compensation, including bonuses and stock potential.	We also
offer what we call the “Booking Deal” with other competitive perks and
benefits.  IT also has monthly hackathons, training and attends/speaks at
global conferences.

This position is open to worldwide candidates and in the case of
relocation, we will assist you with a generous relocation package, ensuring
a smooth transition to working and living in Amsterdam.  We have
successfully relocated 200+ IT professionals to Amsterdam in the last year!
