Location:
United States, CA, Downtown SFO -By the BART

Pay rate: open -110K+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
Want to work with a small team of highly-motivated Perl hackers?

Want the benefits of a large company without giving up that can-do

startup spirit?

Want to write code that makes the world better while also kicking the

competition's butt?

This may be a job for you.

We are part of a market-leading business unit of a Fortune 1000 software
company

with operations in 40 countries. We work on a mission-critical system

that quietly and effectively feeds oxygen to the rocket ship of our product


line.

We're smart and flexible and we get things done.

We fight Spam.
You are a rock-star hacker with a passion for great code and the track

record to prove it.

You love Perl but not to the exclusion of other things.

You also love being on a winning team.

You're serious but not boring, smart but not pretentions,

funny but not rude. You have a life.

You can write the C<Guru> module in your sleep, and when you wake up you

can't help telling us (politely, of course) what's wrong with this

revision of the C<Work> module.

And having read this far, you're already thinking about what C<perform>

should do.


Required skills:
Perl expertise.

OOPerl, C (class) Apache, C ,(complex, voodoo)

Testing experience in C

Solid database knowledge.

C,DBI and a strong understanding of relational

database concepts and their application in the real world.

Senior/Lead engineering experience.

Something on the order of 10 years experience, all of it interesting.

Web application development experience.

Model-View-Controller frameworks, data providers, load balancing, etc.

System programming experience.

This position will involve Heavy Lifting on the server.

Candidates must be fully able to geek out on difficult, esoteric

system-level weirdness in Perl and outside it.
