Job Description

iDirect, a subsidiary of VT Systems, is transforming the way the world gets
and stays connected. The company’s satellite-based IP communications
technology enables constant connectivity for voice, video and data
applications in diverse and challenging environments. The iDirect
Intelligent Platform integrates advanced technology into iDirect’s
portfolio of hubs, routers and network management software to address the
growing complexity of deploying and managing global IP networks. With more
than 15 years of global satellite communications experience, iDirect serves
customers in over 50 countries through a diverse network of service
provider partners, including seven of the World Teleport Associations
Global Top Ten operators. Headquartered in Virginia USA, iDirect has
offices in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.

Our UK Web Development Centre of Excellence is recruiting for a Senior Web
Software Engineer to lead a team who are building our latest, industry
pioneering, Network Management System. Satellite networks are complicated
things; configuration, maintenance, monitoring and reporting is made a lot
easier with our innovative web based NMS.

You’ll work on the full stack from the Linux OS, through scalable & fault
tolerant web services (including websockets) in to an MVC framework and up
to cutting edge web UI toolkits and lovingly crafted JavaScript, HTML5 and
CSS. Working alongside our UX and Design team we build the tools for other
frontend engineering teams to use. We also architect the high availability
load-balanced web servers and associated technologies. Our typical
customers are large telcos and service providers with exacting requirements
and high expectations, and so we always work to the highest standards.


The Senior developer will own the delivery of core frameworks and tools in
Perl and JavaScript and advise on best practice, new techniques, software
quality and process improvement.  The Senior developer will also lead a
team of developers and enable task breakdown, handle task assignment and
prioritisation, ensure work is progressing to the required schedule, help
the team overcome technical blockers by working with other engineering
teams to provide timely resolution to problems and report to management on
the progress of the project.

The Senior Developer will need to be technically astute and have experience
in the delivery of large web-centric projects. The other members of the
team will look to the Senior developer to provide direction, advice and
technical help.


We offer an excellent package which includes:

•	Competitive salary
•	Pension scheme
•	Generous bonus scheme
•	Private health care & dental care (also extendable to your family)
•	Company provided life assurance
•	Company provided income protection scheme.
