Job title: Perl/Java Developer

Company name: T-Mobile

Location: Bellevue, WA

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Engineer/Sr. Engineer, System Design & Strategy

Job Description Summary
Develop automated solutions that provision E911, Alerting, LBS and Small
Cell systems. Develop tools to help support and operations groups do their
jobs more efficiently. Along with developing software, work with various
other groups to increase data reliability and integrity and to help
implement our software solutions.

Position Duties and Responsibilities: 
Design, develop, implement, and document software solutions to
automatically provision Emergency (E911 and WEA), Location Services (LBS)
and Small Cell (Femto) systems.  Design, develop, implement, and document
tools to help Engineers and Tier2 troubleshoot E911 and location failures.
Develop/maintain software that provisions E911/LBS data (such as Cell data)
to multiple systems within and external to Systems Engineering and
Strategy.  Provide troubleshooting support to various Tier2, E911 group,
and regional operation groups.	Communicate with vendors and various groups
within the company the needs of the E911/LBS Infrastructure group.

We are
a close-knit, established team of developers providing tools and
applications to internal customers for data analysis and network element
provisioning.  Seeking a self-motivated person who can take initiative and
learn quickly, operating in a dynamic environment with a considerable
degree of autonomy.  We would consider someone recently out of college or
grad school if they could demonstrate aptitude and a willingness to work
hard and be teachable.

This position offers a little more than average in
terms of job-satisfaction and purpose, since our work directly impacts the
reliability and effectiveness of mobile 911 calls and Wireless Emergency
Alerts on a major wireless carrier.  

T-Mobile is unusually generous with
vacation time, offering 19 days (almost 4 weeks) personal time off, accrual
starting immediately, and up to 29 days (almost 6 weeks) vacation if you
stay long enough.  This on top of 8 paid holidays each year.  The
environment is very family-friendly – telecommunications people tend to be
passionate while at work, but greatly value their work-life balance.

Desired skills:
Functional and Technical Skills:
	Experience with one or more of
Perl, Java, Oracle SQL, XML, SOAP, CSS
	Software development with
HTML
	Experience with Geospatial software, applications and/or
application development is a big plus
	UNIX/LINUX basic
administration/operational knowledge a plus
	General understanding
of Wireless Telecommunication Architectures a plus
	Use of Software

	Experience with DHTML technologies
(JavaScript, CSS and/or HTML 5) a big plus

 Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related discipline.
