Job title:
Perl/Unix Software Developer for Web Hosting and Software company

Company name: TAG Online Inc.

Location: United States, NJ, Upper Montclair

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Mid/senior-level technical professional in a rapidly expanding Internet
business. 

Required skills:
    * Minimum of 4 years of schooling in a computer-related field, or the
professional equivalent
    * Solid knowledge of the Internet and the World Wide Web
    * Strong background in UNIX
    * Some comfort level in Microsoft environments
    * Experience working as a part of a development team
    * Experience trouble-shooting
    * Familiarity with:
	    - Apache (mod_perl would be very helpful)
	    - OO Methods
	    - Some subset of Java, Javascript, C++, C
    * Ability to program in:
	    - HTML
	    - Perl
	    - SQL
    * Ability to operate as both a self-starter and team player
    * Good people and communication skills
    * Eagerness to learn 


As a small company, members of our staff all wear multiple hats. Of key
import is the ability to communicate well, both with clients and coworkers.


Clients occasionally need help with potentially obscure problems that their
local ISPs can not or will not handle. This can involve some in-depth
digging through log files as a part of the process, and the ability to
solve these puzzles is important to the job.

If you have a passion for detailed, quality work that is an expression of
yourself, then TAG Online is the place for you. It is a great company and
we are looking for someone to become part of our team.
