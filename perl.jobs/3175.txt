Description:
We are looking for an experienced software engineer with working
knowledge of Linux, Apache, mod_perl and MySQL to help continue the
development of our core products.  You should know your way around these
technologies in their raw form - not through some overly protective,
graphical, "don't worry, I'll handle the details" IDE, GUI or other
tool.  We work with the real thing here.  As part of the development
team, you will design, develop, debug and test code for both new and
existing systems.  You will be given a great deal of freedom to exercise
your knowledge and experience.	In return, we will expect high quality,
timely, elegant, well engineered solutions that meet the needs of our
internal and external customers.


Required skills:
    - Advanced knowledge of Perl with emphasis on OOP, mod_perl, and
      MySQL integration
    - Fundamental knowledge of web application architecture, database
      design (MySQL), web servers (Apache), JavaScript, HTML
    - Experience with XML, DOMs, Schemas, and parsers
    - Experience building web user interfaces for technical
      tools/workflows
    - Working knowledge of Linux
    - BS and/or 4-8 years of experience in software engineering
    - Sense of humor


Desired skills:
    - Experience with high availability server systems using load
      balancing, caching and optimization techniques in a multi-tiered
      environment
    - Knowledge/experience in Java, C, VBScript, DHTML, CSS
    - Working knowledge of web application authentication and security
      methods
