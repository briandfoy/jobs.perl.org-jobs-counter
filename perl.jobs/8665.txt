There aren’t many jobs where two million people every month will benefit
from what you do. Our mobile internet services provide informative and
entertaining content to such vast numbers of visitors, and you’ll provide
the software engineering expertise to allow them to do this. 

In this dynamic and ever-changing environment you’ll help develop and
maintain core applications and services. And you’ll certainly be kept on
your toes, working on emerging platforms such as messaging, video services
and location-aware applications. You’ll face a variety of technical
challenges and be expected to push the boundaries of what we do. Not only
that, within your multi-disciplined team, you’ll often be called upon to
share your expertise with client side developers, producers and project
managers to ensure everyone is up to speed.


Required skills:
With significant web development experience, you’ll have comprehensive
knowledge of the software development lifecycle and processes. Confident
using Perl, Java, Apache modules, XML, SQL databases and Unix, you’ll
continue to stay abreast of the latest developments in software engineering
and have an active interest in internet/mobile technologies.
