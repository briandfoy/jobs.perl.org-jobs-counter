Job title:
Credit card transaction (and user system) setup needed for HTML::Mason site

Company name: The DogEars Network, LLC

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: per project ($2,000 budget)

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1-2 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I'm a newbie that needs quick help in integrating secure credit card
transactions into an existing HTML::Mason/MySQL website -- www.dogears.net.
 Various other projects are also available, among them: upgrading to a more
coder-and-maintenance-friendly user system and infrastructure, mod_perl and
apache tuning, in short many intermediate/advanced tasks that take a
newbie's very concerted 2 year long effort to the next level.  Time is of
the essence however, release date of next version of site is scheduled a
little over a month from now, strict deadline.	So the credit card
transactions are a priority, the rest is negotiable depending on how
involved you want to get.  This is a quick project that can turn into a
longer-term opportunity.

Required skills:
Expert knowledge of Perl and good understanding of Linux system
administration.  Experience with online credit card transaction
technologies and e-commerce development is a must.  Experience with DBI and
MySQL.	Working familiarity with HTML::Mason highly desirable.

Desired skills:
Understanding and experience with the HTML::Mason API.	Experience with DBI
and MySQL.

Please email tony@dogears.net or call (212)531-4250.  Telephone preferred.
