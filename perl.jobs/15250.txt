Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: All Around The World

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Want a remote Perl job working for a great company with colleagues from all
around the world? We're considering both permanent and contract positions
for a variety of Perl roles. Front-end skills are always welcome and
experience with parallel programming comes in handy more than you would
think.

We do set a high bar on who we employ, so if joining a bunch of
Perl hackers who love the language sounds like fun, send us your CV and
we'll send you our programming test. In return, because we value your time,
Ovid will be evaluating the test and will send you feedback on how you did
and areas for improvement, if any.

Desired skills:
Perl. Strong Perl. You love the language. This is the only solid
requirement.

Front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JS, not design) are often very
useful.

Expertise with parallel processing, including event-driven
programming, is needed.

Good communication skills.

Understanding
databases is important.
