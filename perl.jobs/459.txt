Hi,

If you are interested, please contact Greg Christopher at 
gchristo@adobe.com. If you have sent resume to Greg previously and you are 
out of town and are willing to work in San Jose, California, please send it 
again to him (not me, please).

Here is the job info (updated):

Expert in designing and working in large perl systems, either web based or 
other.
The person should have a minimum of 2 years experience programming in perl, 
and be
able to "execute" in a production atmosphere. Windows system experience
is a requirement (especially driving windows applications from perl), and 
Unix experience
is a very strongly desired qualification. Mac system experience is
a huge plus as well, as the scripts need to execute on Mac OS 10.
Desired (not required):
-Acrobat
-perforce
-OLE
-AppleScript
-shell scripting (tcsh, csh, DOS)
-SOAP (esp. Soap-lite)
-Unix system administration

(NEW INFO)

- Contract is initially set up for a full 6 months, and  it's not 
necessarily "long term".
- Need to work in San Jose.
- The job does involve HTML creation and some CGI work, but the main thrust 
of the
   work is driving the execution of our Acrobat desktop products through 
perl and IAC
   to achieve automated testing results. The person should have familiarity 
with object perl,
   and should be fluent in Unix and familiar with the Mac OSX platform.

Shelley
