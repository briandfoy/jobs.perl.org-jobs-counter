Job title:
Bring more Modern Perl to a properly agile team in Manchester (and learn
NodeJS)

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: Macclesfield, near Manchester, UK

Pay rate: Commensurate with experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Successful and established team about to undergo an large expansion looking
for Perl developers at every level of experience, from school leaver to
Larry Wall.

As part of their expansion, and having mastered continuous
delivery and Scrum in a way that works primarily for rather than against
developers, the team is looking for Perl developers to support a move
towards a more API-centric approach. The team=E2=80=99s upcoming focus on b=
ringing
their product to international markets will need to be supported by
developers who want to grow along with the company =E2=80=93 both technical=
ly and
managerially =E2=80=93 and who have an interest in getting stuck into diffi=
cult
problems like internationalisation.

The team loves Perl, and has a real
depth of Perl talent, but know that some services benefit from other stacks
=E2=80=93 most recently they=E2=80=99ve been experimenting with NodeJS, so =
either
experience or an interest in learning would be beneficial. As you=E2=80=99d=
 expect
from a long-established business who are still improving their product
daily, the codebase itself is a mixture of older and newer code, but with
technical management who are very keen to embrace Modern Perl.

Fundamentally the team values people who are looking to make a difference,
and who want to push small changes that improve their customers=E2=80=99
experience, day after day.

The team works flexible hours, and while some
onsite in Manchester is expected, for the right candidate this needn=E2=80=
=99t be
an entirely onsite role.

Desired skills: Perl
