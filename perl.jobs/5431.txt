Position Summary

Are you one of those people who are constantly thinking of new ways to make
Web technology work better? Do you consider yourself a closet marketing
guru?  Do you have the technical and creative skills to put your ideas into
action?  If so, we have the job for you.  We’re looking for a “mad
technical genius” type of person who can come in here and turn our Web
marketing machine into something special.  We want good ideas, but we also
need someone who can sit down make those ideas actually work. This goes
beyond Web page design and coding and gets into behind-the-scenes
infrastructure and tools that can help us automate and measure prospect
interactions with GT Nexus.  We have many capabilities built already, so
we’re not starting from scratch but the right person can really make a
difference here and have a lot of fun doing it. Many internal departments
depend on our Web resources, so the growth potential is very high. 

Responsibilities 
- Maintain and optimize the corporate website
- Design and deploy new capabilities to website
- Maintain corporate intranet (internal) site
- Develop new tools/applications to support marketing automation needs
- Support corporate initiatives where e-marketing is required
- Support marketing design needs -- these might extend beyond the Web, DOE

Company Overview 
GT Nexus is a profitable, privately held company that is positioned to take
advantage of two major global business trends – globalization and on-demand
technology.  As companies move manufacturing to overseas markets, they are
struggling to get those goods back to where they are needed. This $1.3
trillion market is rapidly adopting the kind of technology that GT Nexus
offers. GT Nexus operates an industry-backed portal, where companies use
the Web to manage global trade. Customers like The Home Depot, Dupont,
Kmart, Hewlett Packard and Xerox use our portal over the Web, on-demand at
a fraction of the cost and none of the risk associated with big traditional
enterprise software. For more information, visit our Website at
www.gtnexus.com.
