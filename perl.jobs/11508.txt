Description:
We are looking to form a second scrum team of Perl developers for an
existing telecoms & managed services client. We are looking to fill a

little, some or lots of Perl development experience we'd love to hear from

develop and test multi-tier implementations to address the requirements.

The job will be based in the beautiful county of Cornwall (surf, sea, fresh
air). Our preference is to employ the successful candidate as a permanent
employee (although contract employment can also be offered).

Please only apply if you are eligible to live and work in the UK.

Required skills:
Perl

NB If you are expecting an upper-end salary range then many of the desired
skills (below) would also be expected.

Desired skills:
OO Perl
CPAN
SQL (any flavours)
Web front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery)
Web protocols e.g. HTTP
PostgreSQL
Source/Version Control systems and practices (preferably Git)
Experience of Scrum / Agile
Python
