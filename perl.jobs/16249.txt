Job title: System Administrator

Company name: Adjust GmbH

Location: Berlin, Germany

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a top-notch systems administrator to help us maintain
and expand our infrastructure.	Most automation is done with Perl and (R)ex
(or actually our fork of that).  We have an international team and conduct
our business internally in English. What follows is our standard
description of this position:

Have you always wanted to be the solid
foundation upon which all others can rest? We may have the role for you!

We are looking to complement our server administration team to keep our
top-notch mean machines humming and crunching all night long. Our system is
built upon bare metal machines running on Gentoo Linux to satisfy our needs
for a highly customized and specialized environment. We process around 10
petabytes of data monthly, which is distributed over 450+ servers globally
with up to 1.5 TB of RAM, dozens of discs and several high end Intel CPUs

You will help us wrap up the decentralization of our infrastructure over
various locations and continuously scale it, making sure that our servers
run smoothly and at their highest efficiency. You will be proactively
looking for improvements, offering your help, taking over shifts for on
call duties and executing solutions following your automation drive.

As a
System Administrator, you will not only create architecture but also
provide infrastructure for developers using Redis, Aerospike and
PostgreSQL, working closely together with our development and marketing
teams to address their needs.

If you also enjoy predictable infrastructure
that is based on proven and reliable technologies, we should have a chat!

Desired skills:
Perl
C
Systems Administration
Aerospike
PostgreSQL
Redis
Systems
Engineering
