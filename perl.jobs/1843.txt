Job title: Perl/Windows Programmer

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Pay rate: Open

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Philadelphia office of an internationally recognized law firm is
seeking a contract Perl programmer (on MS platform).  We are in the process
of redesigning a sizeable application and I would like someone who has the
skills to assist with these tasks: 

Database – DBI/SQL/RDBMS skills are a must.  We are using SQL Server. 
Experience with financial data is a big plus.

Web site modifications – Make changes to dynamic, DB-driven site.  Some
DHTML would be helpful.  

Windows GUI development – I have been using Win32::GUI but am looking into
wx because it seems to be better for encapsulating GUI elements. 
Windows/Perl application design skills are a big plus.

LWP-ish work – We need to automate acquisition of data from various web
sites.	Most of these programs run as scheduled jobs.  I would like to
create some sort of dispatcher to log/manage these processes.

Other necessary skills include: good communication, clean coding, code
documentation, CVS and the ability to do some basic math and accounting.

If you think you are a good match for this position, please send resume,
availability and rate.
