Job title: Find & Replace Perl Script

Company name: Praetoria Development, Inc.

Location: United States, FL, Miami

Pay rate: $20 US Dollars

Travel: 0%

Length of employment: 10-15 minutes

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I need a very simple perl script written which does a find/replace for
*.html documents in a directory.

All the HTML files have basically the same template.

1) I want to replace <body> with <body><adsense code><table><tr><td>.  Some
of the html documents have differing <body> tags, so you need to match
<body ...*>

2) I want to delete several <Meta..> tags.

3) I need to close the table that I opened in #1, so replace </table> with
</td></tr></table>

Thats it!
