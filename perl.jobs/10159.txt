Job title: Hands-on Engineering Manager

Company name: Lokku Ltd.

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: Above market

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This position was previously posted in May 2010.  We have spoken too some
great canidates, but the role remains unfilled.

----

Lokku is the company that makes the Nestoria property search engine.

  http://www.lokku.com/
  http://www.nestoria.com/

Our team is growing.  We are looking to immediately hire a senior software
engineer with management experience to help us adapt and evolve.

Some highlights:

* This job will involve managing people, but we are not looking for someone
that has given up on coding.  This role >will< be committing to the source
repository.

* We love Perl, but we are willing to bring someone in that has not yet
learned to love Perl quite as much as us.  Please distribute this
announcement to anyone that you think is a first rate engineering manager
no matter what their language or editor preference.

* Lokku is willing to pay a higher-than-average salary for a
better-than-average person.  We also offer ownership in the company through
a share option scheme that is tax efficient.

* We are not truly a start-up anymore, but we will never be a "big"
company.  Lokku needs someone that can wear a lot of hats and thrive
without structure.

Required skills:
perl
apache
mysql
UNIX
man-management

Desired skills:
automated testing
high-volume data processing
scalable architectures
jquery
