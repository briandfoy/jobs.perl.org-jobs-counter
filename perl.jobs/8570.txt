Job title: Perl Programmer

Company name: Disys

Internal ID: 2222

Location: TX, Irving

Pay rate: $40 to $50 an hour

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 12 month contract to hire

Hours: Full time

Description:
My client is looking for 3 mid-to-senior level PERL/LAMP developers;
ideally all three consultants will have solid all-around Perl, Javascript,
SQL, and Linux skills and have Linux systems level development or
administration skills. If the thought of working for an industry leader in
a high visibility role interests you please do not hesitate to contact me! 


To learn more about this exciting opportunity please read below. For more
information please contact me at

or call

(214) 329-0125 

First, about the positions:

• If you know Perl, Javascript, SQL, and Linux in about that order, they’re
looking for you, this position is for mid-to-senior level developers
comfortable with writing both web (70%) and non-web (30%) applications in
Perl on Linux.
• If the idea of coding this week and trying to figure out the best way to
get the database to failover to a redundant server next week appeals to
you, you're probably a great candidate for my client.
• Experience with Oracle, PostgreSQL, AJAX and other Web 2.0 techniques,
bash scripting and UNIX/Linux administration aren't required, but will move
you to the front of the list.

Second, about my client:

• My client has been around since 1923. They are one of just a handful of
companies in the US that make and sell first-responder radio systems (known
as "land mobile radio" in the business). If you've seen firemen, police
officers, emergency crews, and others carrying around a radio the size of a
small brick, it might have been one of theirs or Motorola.
• BusinessWeek previously ranked them as one of the fastest growing public
companies in America , but are still a good size. There is a lot of room
for individuals to make big contributions and at the same time, they’re an
established company with a full benefit plan.
• My client is located in Las Colinas at 114 and 161 so they’re pretty
convenient from both the Dallas and Fort Worth side of the world.

Third, about the group:

Our group builds two kinds of software:

1) The software that allocates bandwidth and connects the radios to each
other (mostly C++ on an embedded platform).
2) The software that configures, monitors, and reports against the embedded
platform (a collection of web applications written mostly with Perl,
Oracle, and JavaScript on Linux/Apache).

As described above, my client is looking for help with the 2nd kind
