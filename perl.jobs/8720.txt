Based in London’s Docklands area we are the leading organisation in our

They have recently attained a top 30 spot in the Deloitte fast 50 awards
making them one of the fastest growing high technology company in the
country. 

Their product base is unique and groundbreaking in almost every aspect and

Their products are presented via the web and we operate exclusively off a
Linux/Apache/MySQL cluster. They are looking for an experienced, competent
and diligent perl developer to join their core technical development team.
The candidate’s contribution to their current and future products will be
fundamental to the perception and growth of the company in the future;

As a developer the candidate will be required to: 

* Develop a good understanding of the business requirements. 
* Produce a technical specification and design, describing in detail how
the requirements will be achieved. 
* Develop, test and deliver high quality backend PERL applications to
provide exactly what was requested. 
* Work closely with the business to finish the projects on time, follow
strict quality checking procedures to deliver a high quality product and
achieve sign-off from all interested parties. 
* Assist with the release of the work into the production environment and
take responsibility to ensure the change is successful. 

The successful candidate should be able to demonstrate the following
skills: 

* Obviously a good understanding of PERL code and conventions on a Linux
platform. 
* Performance and load testing of mission critical high availability
enterprise applications. 
* Be able to adequately communicate with non technical staff and clients to
correctly interpret requirements. 
* MySQL, AJAX, DBI

We use many open source libraries and modules including AJAX libs
(prototype, moo fx, Jquery) plus a host of CPAN modules.
