Job title: Perl Developer needed in Singapore

Company name: CoreBPM Pte Ltd

Location: Singapore

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a Perl developer to work for us here in Singapore.

About us: We are a small company doing specialized work. In simple terms we
provide a system that exposes user-friendly interfaces to control networked
electronic devices using Perl. 

We need a developer capable of working independently and building
products/solutions from scratch. Essentially we need a responsible and
efficient person.

About Singapore: Singapore is a small island-nation south of malaysia
characterised by low taxes, a cool skyline, modern infrastructure,
cleanliness, lots of pretty little islands in the neighbourhood and direct
air connectivity to most of the important places in the world.

Required skills:
Required skills are actually quite simple but also very specific and
mandatory:

* Familiarity with USB, parallel/serial port and network based device
control(FTDI, SNMP, etc.) using Perl.
* Some XS knowledge
* Higher-Order Perl. Modern Perl. We use functional programming techniques
in many places.
* Familiarity with event-driven programming. Experience with POE, AnyEvent
or any similar event driven multi-tasking framework.
* Moose.

Edit: Please note that we have been been getting a lot of applications from
candidates with only web development experience. This does not match the
type of skills we are looking for. 
If you have only used Perl for web development throughout your career, your
skills while usable in other listings are not suited to this position.
Please re-assess the required skill sets listed above before applying. 
thanks

Desired skills:
* DBIx::Class
* Corosync / Pacemaker
* Test driven development
