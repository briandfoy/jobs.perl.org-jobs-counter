Job title:
Agile Perl Developer for Enterprise Network Management Software

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Pay rate: 80-90K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hi there.  I'm Blake Mills, the DevTeam lead at AirWave Wireless.  We're
expanding our development team, and you might be just the one we're looking
for.  Three years ago, I was looking for a company that was small enough
that I could make an impact, yet had the stability of a larger
organization.  I found it here at AirWave.  We have an enthusiastic group
of developers and a great working environment.	Just watch out though, you
might find your keyboard encased in Jello like I did last April Fools day.

Ok, so I've got your attention.  You're starting to think that this might
be the job for you.  Aside from office pranks, what is it that we do at
AirWave?  Glad you asked.  We develop network management software that is
used by many of the leading IT organizations at Fortune 500 companies,
major universities, hospitals, and other prominent institutions.  Rolling
out a wireless network is a daunting task, and we provide tools to ease
that burden.  Our industry leading software helps plan, configure, manage,
and monitor some of the largest wireless networks on the planet.

Our team practices extreme programming (XP), which means we spend most of
our time writing code.	We believe that running code and short feedback
loops speak louder than excessive documentation and month long design
meetings.  We practice test-driven development and have a fairly
comprehensive suite of tests... over 23,000 at last count. We pair program,
which means you'll learn the system quickly and have a great time doing it.
We have short release cycles so your talents won't sit idle working on
projects that never see the light of day. Software you write today will be
managing enterprise networks in a couple weeks.  We've been cited as the
longest running continuous XP project in the industry (five years and
counting) so we have gotten quite good at embracing its advantages while
avoiding the pitfalls.

Excited?  Good. Now to the nuts and bolts.  AirWave develops software in
several different languages and the current position will be working on
Linux writing object-oriented Perl.  We use Apache mod_perl as our front
end UI and Postgres as our backend persistence layer.
 
Responsibilities - The software engineer's responsibilities include
designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code that is part of a
shipping enterprise network management and monitoring software package.
