Description:
A talented Perl programmer is needed for an ongoing project to improve and
add new functionality to our primary backend system - a provisioning and

modern Perl, Dancer, Moose, DBIx::Class, robust Test::Class::Moose-powered

We strive towards code reuse and sane coding
standards, with peer code reviews and discussion encouraged. There is a
dedicated QA team and separated dev, QA, and production environments. We
collaborate over IRC, use GitHub for version control, and Redmine for
project management in an agile environment.

In return we offer excellent
remuneration, flexible working, the chance to hang out in yet another Perl
IRC channel, no admin work whatsoever and the opportunity to make a real
difference.

About us:
UK2 Group is a large multinational web hosting
company, offering a wide range of solutions across multiple brands.  We
were recently acquired by THG - The Hut Group, a fast-growing retail
company with a wide range of brands, so this is an excellent time of growth
for us.

Desired skills:
Required skills:
* Strong Perl programming experience (including OO,
debugging, test-driven development, use of the CPAN etc) in a commercial
environment
* Experience with Moose and DBIx::Class
* 2-3 yrs experience
working on Unix-based systems (systems administration or Perl development).

registration / web hosting market=20=20
