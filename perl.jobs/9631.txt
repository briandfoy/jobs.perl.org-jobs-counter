Job title: Perl & JavaScript Developer

Company name: AdCopy

Internal ID: VIP

Location: United States, PA, Philadelphia

Pay rate: Salary

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
A Center City based Internet technology startup is looking for a few
amazing, aggressive developers to help us with our product launch. 

Prepare to be thrown to the sharks and help a real company expand from the
ground up. You will join a team of well-connected, experienced executives
and entrepreneurs in a super fast-paced environment. Prepare for more
responsibility than anyone else would dare give you. 

Pre-requisites: Super hard-working, fun to be around, allergic to BS and a
figurative pair of brass balls. You'll also need to be proficient with the
tools of the trade: JavaScript, Perl, Postgres or other SQL based
databases. A handle on C/C++ is a bonus! The ability to work independently
is critical; we won't hire a baby sitter to care for you. 

Location: Center City Philadelphia 

Hours, compensation: As many as you can give us, variable based upon
performance & experience. 

Send customary bribes, martial arts demo video (youtube okay), and
resume/CV to the craigslist email address.
