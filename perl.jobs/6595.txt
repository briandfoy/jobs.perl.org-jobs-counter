hinkGeek is looking for an experienced software developer, strong in Perl,

assisting with internal documentation maintenance.

Internets. As part of SourceForge, Inc, a publicly held company, ThinkGeek
employees receive an excellent benefits package while enjoying the benefits
of working in an exciting start-up environment in our Fairfax, Virginia
office. This posting is for a permanent, full time position in our Fairfax,
Virginia office. Only local applicants or those willing to relocate at
their own expense will be considered.

    * 5+ years professional programming experience with Perl 5
    * 4+ years professional experience working with databases (SQL)
    * Extensive knowledge of Apache and familiarity with Apache module

    * Ability to comprehend and implement complex business requirements in
an exacting manner
    * Team oriented personality
