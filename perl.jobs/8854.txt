Job title: email batching 

Company name: Clackmas Paper

Location: United States, OR, Clackmas

Pay rate: Bid

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We need to have a perl script built for us that will batch our emails in
clumps of 400 and send them out for us. 

The problem we are dealing with is that our hosting company only allows us
to send 400 emails an hour. Sometimes we have more then 400 emails that
need to be sent out. My thoughts for the script is for it to run on our
server so that any files that are in the directory called outgoing_emails
are sent out run every hour. An example of the outgoing email file is in
the format($from_email,$from_name,$to_email,$subject,$message)
For an example of it:
http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=f344edae266c3d36d2db6fb9a8902bda


1. check once an hour to see if there are any files in the outgoing_email
dir. 
2. read in the lines of the oldest file. If there are more then 400
lines/emails to be sent. Send out the first 400 and then sleep until the
hour changes, send out the next 400, ect
3. once a file of emails has been sent it will be moved to a new directory
called emails_sent.


Please ask questions if you have them. I look forward to your bid. Thank
you for your time.
