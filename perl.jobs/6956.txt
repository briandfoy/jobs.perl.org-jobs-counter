Job title:
Senior Software Engineer - Application Development - Relocation

Company name: GridApp Systems, Inc.

Internal ID: Perl.org GA 709

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: Very competitive salary

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
"What is the sound of Perl? Is it not the sound of a wall that people have
stopped banging their heads against?"  ~Larry Wall

Are you a Swiss Army Knife type of Perl Software Engineer, someone who
offers the creativity, intuitiveness and skills of a MacGyver? GridApp
Systems is looking for an equally creative, intuitive, and technically
skilled person to be part of an incredibly smart and dynamic team of
full-life cycle Perl developers who are architecting, developing, and
testing our highly-acclaimed enterprise database management and automation
software suite.

If you are like us, you want your work to make an impact; you to be more
than just a small piece of tread in a monster-truck sized tire; you want to
work with smart people who appreciate teamwork, camaraderie, and red
Swingline staplers. You want your talents to help create the next
award-winning, billion dollar product.

The work environment – this is not a 24/7 position; you’re with others who
love Perl and open source. Naturally, there may be times when you have to
put in the hours but you won’t regularly be calling in for pizza delivery
at 4:00 AM. Our development team is top shelf with a myriad of personal
interests that always seem to find their way into our daily activities. In
an nutshell, it’s programmer casual with a company that was created by
developers.

And if you do work at GridApp Systems, you will be well paid, will receive
benefits and stock options, and unlike quite a few companies these days, we
also provide relocation money for stellar candidates.

Read the GridApp blog (http://blog.gridapp.com) and leaf through the great
industry, systems, development, and career resources we’re assembling for
you.

Required skills:
Mid to senior level developer with 5+ years Perl development experience,
preferably of the OO variety (Perl/PHP/C++, even better)

TCP/IP network and/or distributed systems programming helpful but not
necessary

Experience working with one or more of these databases -
Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL

Very comfortable with Linux (and ideally UNIX as well)

Desired skills:
Have viewed Office Space, This is Spinal Tap, and Napoleon Dynamite several
times
