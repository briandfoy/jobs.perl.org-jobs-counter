Job title:
OO Perl programmer to migrate to RoR at Sunnyvale, CA startup

Company name: Quality Humans, Inc.

Internal ID: Sunnyvale Perl/RoR client

Location: United States, CA, Sunnyvale

Pay rate: USD $90-110K/year

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're a development, staffing, and recruiting company with our principal
people scattered around the USA.

We started by offering Perl/Unix skills for hire in 2002. We later started
staffing and recruiting for companies that wanted those skills.

We became interested in RoR in the middle of 2005 and we now have a very
interesting client in Sunnyvale, CA, that needs several RoR full-time
employees. But they'd also like a solid OO Perl background.

What's really important is that you have a demonstrated record of enjoying
really good quality programming and development for a number of years,
preferably with a narrow focus like OO Perl, and with a focus on the
traditional Unix/Linux space.

This client is a small startup, VC-funded, working in an interesting new
space. We have met them and chatted tech for a few hours and they seem very
'real'. They are only 5 people right now, so you should be the kind of
person who will enjoy a small environment where you can really have an
impact.

The best part of this is that you get to increase your Perl/RoR skills to
an expert level (if not already) under the eye of an existing expert, and
you get to do it while building something interesting and getting paid to
do it.

These positions may start as full-time salary or full-time contract (maybe
converting to salary later).

Candidates who are in the SF Bay, LA, Portland, and Seattle are given
preference.


Required skills:
Solid OO Perl history for at least 4 years.

Solid programming and development history for at least 10 years.

Unix/Linux.

SQL.

Apache, lighttpd, etc.

Always learning and moving forward in technology and methodology.


Desired skills:
RoR experience.

High volume web sites or systems.
