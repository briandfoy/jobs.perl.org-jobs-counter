Job title: Perl/MySQL/HTML/JavaScript

Company name: FreedomVOICE Systems

Internal ID: 1234

Location: United States, CA, Encinitas

Pay rate: $45,000 USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for someone who can handle web programming consisting of
HTML, JavaScript, and Perl + MySQL.  Basic FreeBSD and Apache skills are
also desirable.  Knowledge of C++ programming is a big bonus.
 
We currently have a proprietary webserver which hosts our webpages and
secure online order forms.  We need to replace this webpage with a standard
FreeBSD/Apache setup, and replace the backend of the pages with Perl code
which stores the orders in MySQL.  This also involves customizing the HTML
for versions of the order form for different distributors.
 
We have other proprietary webservers which would eventually be moved to the
standard setup as well.  There is plenty of work to be done.  Because the
existing systems are in place and functioning (sometimes), we do not need
to port them along any sort of breakneck schedule, although the sooner the
better.
 
We need someone who is sufficently skilled and motivated to handle this
project.  This is a full time, long term position.  The rate for this
position is $45,000.  The company is an approx $4M per year
telecommunications company, highly profitable and secure.  We have a
monthly cash bonus system.

Employees are expected to be located in San Diego County.
 
Interested parties should email me privately at jeremiah@freedomvoice.com
with their resumes or a detailed description of their skills and
experience.


Required skills: Perl, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript

Desired skills: Apache, FreeBSD, C++
