Description:
Naama Networks is a early stage startup building a scalable marketplace for
online food ordering.  We're looking for developers that can rattle off
regexes, know when deciding not to use Moose isn't premature optimization
and aren't afraid to dirty their hands with some timely denormalization.We
love open source software. Any work done on CPAN modules we gladly will
contribute back. If we do something that we think will be useful to others,
we'll definitely consider pushing up to CPAN. We get so much from the
community, we would like to return what we can.If you've got proven
experience or if you don't but you've got something to prove, we want to
hear from you.

What we need:- solid understanding of perl and object oriented programming
- work with a relational database, mysql in particular
- understand working in a unix environment- a love of programming and an
affinity for creative problem solving

Any of these would be gravy:

- Moose experience
- Experience with AWS, EC2 and SQS especially
- NoSql experience, MongoDB especially
- knowledge of linux administration
- knowledge of apache and mod_perl administration
- experience with git
- experience with serialization methods like json, protocol buffers and
thrift

As young as we are we've experienced surprising enthusiasm for our product
on both sides of the market and we're charging ahead. We need your help. If
you live and breath Perl and Linux, get in touch with us.

Please email your resume to us, the subject should say [perl developer].
