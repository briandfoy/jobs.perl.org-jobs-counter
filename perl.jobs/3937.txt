IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys for a variety of
clients in the market research industry. We offer both software licensing

Responsibilities:

1) Improve our core software by developing feature additions and bug fixes.

3) Provide technical support to clients by responding to support requests
through phone and email, and writing custom Perl code for client projects.


Required skills:
Object-oriented Perl, mod_perl, DBI and PostgreSQL are the primary skills

good personal skills and a professional manner with clients is essential.
The ability to work independently is also a must.

Desired skills:
Because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked to wear
different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to help the
company grow and prosper.
