Job title:
Simple Solutions to Big Problems - Perl Developers across the experience
range

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: London

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Me, I get excited by shiny things. I played with Maypole before Catalyst or
Mojolicious was a thing, and I wrote some mean Class::DBI code before
DBIx::Class took over the Perl ORM business.

But it=E2=80=99s possible to build
clean, fast, simple, elegant and reliable Perl the old way. You can write
effective tests without needing to invent a test-specific DSL, you can
write web-services without using the trendiest new web-framework, and you
can lovingly hand-craft performant and understandable SQL.

What=E2=80=99s more,
you can do this while running one of the UK=E2=80=99s largest, most success=
ful, and
most profitable web properties. You can do this at scale, and fall back on
the simplicity of your system when debugging rather than needing to
hand-pick through multi-page stack traces generated by some tooling.

And
you can do all of this while providing a work environment that=E2=80=99s fr=
iendly,
forward-looking, and full of free food.

They=E2=80=99re heavily invested in the
wider London Perl community, I=E2=80=99m always bumping into their people a=
t Perl
conferences, and I have many former colleagues and current friends enjoying
their time there.

With excellent benefits, an excellent salary package,
and an engineering culture that focuses on excellence, simply delivered,
isn=E2=80=99t it time for a simple life?

Desired skills:
Our client uses the classic LAMP stack of Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl. To
hit their scaling needs, they make heavy use of AWS, queueing and
job-management systems like Gearman, and Memcached for making sure data is
quickly available when needed. Experience with these would be an advantage,
but it's not essential to know all of them.
