Job title: Developer - Music and Metadata

Company name: state51

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
state51 makes software to manage music and metadata. Working with
successful indie labels and distributors this software has delivered
millions of tracks to hundreds of music services around the world.

We are based in east London, and part of a group of companies all working
with music. We now have a vacancy for one exceptional developer to take
this and other music projects forward.

Required skills:
The current code is a large set of persistent objects developed in Perl, so
there will be a lot of that, but experience as a professional OO developer
will be valued over any particular language as we look for any good way to
achieve results.  The programming team is small and in control of its own
tools (svn, trac) and environment.

Desired skills:
An interest in music and metadata is highly desirable.
