Job title:
We need just one more person to complete our talented development team

Company name: Ionzero

Internal ID: iz3612

Location: Telecommute

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a decent software developer with some experience with
Perl as used to build web applications.  You'll need to know the standard
tools - Perl, HTML and database tools such as DBI / etc.  Experience with
more modern tools such as Catalyst, Moose, DBIx::Class is a bonus but is
not required.  We use these tools somewhere in our organization every day
and if you have them, you will put them to use.  If not, that's ok, this is
a good place to start getting familiar, because there's plenty to do
without being a pro at them.  Some experience with object oriented
programming is necessary, and at least a basic understanding of MVC is a
good thing.  


You will need to be self-motivated.  That's not double-speak. We won't
leave you without instruction, but once you have it we expect that you will
work on it until it's done or you'll shout loudly because you need help. 
We would much rather be talking with you about new problems and interesting
technologies than asking you how it's coming… again. ;-) 


Our clients and staff are all over the world.  We use all the tools
available to us to communicate and coordinate effectively.  You will need
to be involved with us on a daily basis via these tools… In other words,
good communication skills (initiating conversations as well as contributing
to the team) are a must.  


If all of this sounds like you, please send as much of the following as you
can stand:  Resume / Salary needs / Sample code.  The more information you
send us the higher the chances that you will get on our short list.  


Ionzero is a low key meritocracy built on respect.  You have many
opportunities to demonstrate your skills, as well as to learn new ones. We
have many great and talented people (and so far, no jerks!) as well as
complex and interesting problems to solve.  If you are a solid Perl
programmer who is looking to work with some great people and get some hands
on with modern tools and methodologies, we are interested in talking with
you.

Required skills:
* Perl
* HTML / CSS / Javascript 
* Template systems (such as Template Toolkit)
* SQL / DBI
* Object Oriented concepts, Solid understanding of MVC a plus
* Good communication skills, both verbal and written / online

Desired skills:
* Spanish
* Mobile Development (Android/iOS)
* HTML5
