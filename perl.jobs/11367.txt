Job title: Perl Module & Script Installation

Company name: Independent Developer

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: one hour or less

Onsite: no

Description:
Hello:
Im a perl novice and can write small snippets of code but not anything
complex yet.

I would like to have a small, (150 lines), email handling perl script
installed in my server, which is found for free unrestricted download at:

http://www.outshine.com/software/perl-email-filter/mailfilter_pl.txt

Clear instructions to be found at the readme file at:

http://www.outshine.com/software/perl-email-filter/mailfilter_readme.txt

Requires de Perl Module Mail::Filter which does all the heavy work.

Your job, (if you care to accept it), is to get the script working and once
it is working to have the script print to the browser the contents of the
To: From: Cc: Bcc: and Body: of the email sent to it. Thats it.. I will
continue with script development from this point on , on my own.

If you can provide an easier method for obtaining the To: From: Bcc: Cc:
and Body and print it to the browser and prefer using your method I'll be
happy to do it your way.

Hope you like your 10 minute assignment.

This job is for right now.. accept it today.. get paid today.

Best Regards
Have a great Day
