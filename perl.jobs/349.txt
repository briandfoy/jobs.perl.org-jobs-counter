Job title:
Perl Script for Clickbank Passthru of Affiliate Code to Paypal

Company name: Route 66 Cyber Cafe, Inc.

Location: United States, OK, Tulsa

Pay rate: Negotiable - bidding

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 1 day

Description:
Please send your bids for the following job:

I need a script that will pass a Clickbank affiliate ID through a Paypal
transaction and send me an email letting me know which affiliate just made
a paypal sale. 
The customer comes from another website by clicking through, then passes
the affiliate code through to a Paypal sale (if they decide to pay by
Paypal)
I am looking for someone to write this, but my company wants to own the
code exclusively in order to sell it commercially.  We'll gladly refer
other webmasters to the programmer that we choose, and we'll choose the one
who comes up with the most unique solution and who bids the lowest. The one
who comes up with the most unique and creative method, along with
documentation that an average webmaster could follow, will be the one to
win the project.
Once this project is completed, the most creative programmer will also be
hired for many other jobs.

Required skills:
Perl/CGI expertise.
Knowledge of how the Clickbank affiliate cgi passes the affiliate code.
(you can see an example by going to this page and clicking on the links
that say "Pay by secure server" at the bottom of the page here:
http://www.littlewebsitethatcould.net/default.htm
and knowledge of the Paypal transaction process (just a general idea of the
steps involved)_

Desired skills: Perl/CGI fluency.
