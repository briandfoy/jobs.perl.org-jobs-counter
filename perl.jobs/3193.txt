Job title:
Top Notch Perl Hacker Needed to Help Change Politics

Company name: We Also Walk Dogs

Location: United States, Illinois, Chicago

Pay rate: Competetive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking to hire an experienced Perl developer to help our clients,
including groups like MoveOn.org, change the face of politics.

In this position, you will work with a small team to architect, develop and
support web-based applications that will be used by millions of people.

The position is telecommute.  As a result, you must be a self-starter,
capable of taking a project from start to finish without constant direct
supervision.

The position is a full-time contract position.

Required skills:
You must have at least three years of experience developing production web
applications on a Linux/Apache/mod_perl (LAMP) platform.  Ideally, you are
well-versed in HTML::Mason or other perl-based templating systems
(Text::Template, HTML::Embperl).

You have extensive experience developing database-backed web applications. 
MySQL experience is preferred.

Since this position requires ongoing interaction with clients and other
developers, you must be able to work in a team.  You will be in email, IM
and phone contact with We Also Walk Dogs developers and clients, so a good
"user interface" is an absolute must!

Desired skills:
UNIX system administration and IP networking experience is a plus.
