Pay rate: 120K range USD to start plus benefits

Description:
COMPANY BACKGROUND
TigerLead Solutions is a privately held, owner-operated and thriving young
company in its fifth year of providing residential property search portals,
online marketing services and lead management SaaS to successful Realtors
throughout North America.  We're seeking a talented developer to assume a
senior role within our team of engineers and spearhead the creation of
tools that users will love, such as our latest offering
(http://tigerlead.com/product/new_media) showcasing an industry-first real
estate search capability entirely within the Facebook environment.  

ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY
As a Senior Developer, you will be playing a central role in the design,
development, and delivery of web applications for one of the most
heavily-trafficked network of real estate sites on the web. You will work
in a small, collaborative environment with other seasoned pros and with the
direct support of the companyâ€™s owners and CTO.  Your canvas and raw
materials include rich data sets totaling several million property listings
replenished daily by hundreds of external data feeds. This valuable data
and our powerful end-user tools to access it are deployed across several
thousand real estate search sites used by more than a million home-buyer
leads and growing by 50K+ users each month.  The 1M+ leads using our search
tools are in turn tracked and cultivated by the several thousand real
estate professionals using our management software. This is an outstanding
opportunity to see your creations immediately embraced by a large community
of users while you working within a creative and supportive environment.  

BENEFITS
We're offering a competitive starting salary with opportunity for growth,
medical benefits, paid holidays and personal days, paid monthly parking, a
casual work environment with no dress code, a well-stocked kitchen with
both healthy and not-so-healthy food and beverages, the opportunity to join
a talented and committed team of engineers as well as extremely nice folks
in all areas of the company.  Participation in the twice-daily Quake
sessions is voluntary but highly encouraged. 

Relocation assistance is negotiable if needed.

AN ENDORSEMENT: If you're a member of the Perl community, then you may be
familiar with Tim Bunce.  Tim has been part of our team for several years
and was kind enough to say "TigerLead is a lovely company to work for and
this is a great opportunity. Highly recommended."	 

Required skills:
-a *nix enthusiast with solid history of success in open source web
development
-prefer to work in all layers of the stack
-expert level experience with Perl and frameworks such as Catalyst (Python
and Ruby experience is relevant, but a Perl "true believer" would be the
best fit)
-front-end skills include the ability to hand-code HTML, JavaScript
(preferably jQuery), and CSS
-expert-level SQL skills (PostgreSQL is our preferred flavor)
-strong background in OO architecture and MVC design
-comfort with Git or Subversion
-experience with an ORM package such as DBIC, ActiveRecord, or Doctrine
-Excellent communication and collaboration skills
-Demonstrable interest in learning and adopting new tools and techniques
-enjoys an intellectually vigorous environment and contributes to that
intensity
-fun-loving, team-first attitude and a sense of humor (non-negotiable) 

Desired skills:
-BA/BS Computer Science or a technical/quantitative degree
-Unit testing experience and automated integration testing (Selenium)
experience is a plus
-mindful of common web-based attacks and how to avoid common security
pitfalls (XSS, SQL injection...)
-respect for W3C standards, e.g. you obsessively check whether your
HTML/CSS validates at validator.w3.org
