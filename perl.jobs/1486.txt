Job title: OO CGI/mod_perl developer

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: to £40k pa

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The position involves the ongoing development and maintenance of a leading
web based digital content commerce platform, providing payment and other
services to broadcasters, publishers and the music industry.  The
application is 100% perl, using mod_perl, CGI, HTML::Template, and DBI
access to a PostgreSQL database through an in-house developed object
persistence layer (yes, we probably could have used Class::DBI, but it's
too late now).

You will be be involved in design and implementation of new functionality,
bug fixing, and documentation.	There's only one other full time coder, so
it's all hands on.

Most importantly, this is a technology led organisation, where even the CEO
knows how to code a bit, and you will get to propose and implement your own
ideas.

For the right candidate there is the possibility of heading up a
development team within 6 months.  But if that's not what you want then
we're still interested!

Required skills:
Linux or other *nix understanding and experience.  Pragmatic HTML and CSS. 
Ability to use CPAN intelligently.  Proven ability to think laterally and
independently.	Practical SQL.	Previous experience of perl web application
development essential.	Object oriented perl experience absolutely
essential.

Desired skills:
If you can make great coffee under extreme circumstances then that would be
very helpful.  A proper understanding of HTTP, including caching and
proxying, would be nice.  Squid, Wackamole, Apache, HTML::Template,
JavaScript
