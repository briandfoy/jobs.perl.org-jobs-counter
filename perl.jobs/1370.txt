Job title:
e-commerce database/shopping cart project

Company name: EW, inc.

Location: United States, ny, new york

Pay rate: TBD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: project-based

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
i'm launching a small e-commerce web site and need a shopping cart solution
that will:

1) play well with my site's design
2) enable orders to be reflected in an inventory database so i can keep
track of stock.
3) enable me to also have a separate customer/order database that gets data
automatically from authorize.net

i have looked into solutions like x-cart and oscommerce but i do not want
to have to make my whole site a slave to the shopping cart. other
rinky-dink carts just don't inspire much confidence.

interest from individuals and companies welcome - please show me sample
e-commerce work if you can.

Required skills:
see above. authorize.net Perl AIM experience preferred or experience with
another internet payment gateway.
