Subject: looking to gain perl experience
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: JIM@JIMMCCOY.COM ("Jim McCoy")

I am new to Perl and looking to gain real work experience using it.
I have been programming for 12 years using Cobol on the HP-3000. I also have
ColdFusion experience.
There is still quite a bit to learn about Perl, but I would like to start
taking on some small projects.
I am in Southeast, PA with easy access to NJ, DE and Northern MD.  I will
also do telecommute work.
If there is any interest, please get back to me and I will send you a
resume.

Jim Mc Coy
