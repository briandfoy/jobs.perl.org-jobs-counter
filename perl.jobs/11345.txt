Job title: Programmer Analyst, Credit Card Processing

Company name: Caledon Card Services

Location: Canada, Ontario, Georgetown

Pay rate: Negotiable, DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Caledon Card Services is growing again, and we're looking for two brilliant
programmer analysts to work on our financial transaction processing
systems.

Caledon offers competitive remuneration, a relaxed atmosphere, and a
dedicated team of professionals and technical resources to work with.  We
are located in Georgetown, Ontario.

Caledon's computing environment runs primarily on Linux, so preference will
be given to applicants who have experience and/or enthusiasm for open
source operating systems and software.

As a member of Caledon Card Services' development group, the programmer
analysts' responsibilities will include:

Software design: 
Working with our application engineers you will assist in the technical
aspects of the design of new software systems as well as the analysis of
requirements for the maintenance and upgrades of our existing software
infrastructure.

Programming: 
We use a variety of languages and technologies at Caledon.  Proficiency in
any of these languages would be helpful, but is not a requirement: Perl,
Java, PHP, C, Python, JavaScript, SQL, shell scripting (Bash).	The ability
to produce efficient code quickly is a definite asset.	Understanding
computer system interactions and having the ability to identify bottlenecks
and other inefficiencies is important.	You will likely learn new languages
here, but Perl is our current main programming language.

QA/Testing:
Testing of code written by other programmers is also part of the job.  We
recognize that programmers can only test their code so far before it needs
to go on to someone else to work out the bugs that the original designer or
programmer might not have anticipated.	You may sometimes have to set up a
test environment to get this done, so systems administration capabilities
are very useful to have.

Code reviews:
From time to time you may be asked to look over another programmer's code. 
We do this in order to encourage improvements in algorithms, find bugs
early, and also identify and correct any security deficiencies that may
exist.	It's also a great way to learn.

Documentation:
There are several types of documentation required.  We use an internal wiki
for our developer support documentation and requirements.  In general,
programmer analysts will need to produce documentation explaining the
internals, dependencies, and deployment instructions for products they work
on.

Post-deployment support:
After products are deployed, you may be called upon to provide help to our
support staff, and occasionally you may need to talk to a customer or a
vendor in order to debug and/or resolve issues with production systems.


Required skills:
* A keen analytical mind with a desire to learn new things
* You must work well with others
* 5+ years of programming experience, with 2+ years Perl
* Excellent communications in English, including both verbal and written
* Database programming experience 
* A very good understanding of computer security

Desired skills:
* Perl, Java, PHP, JavaScript, SQL
* Database administration experience (PostgreSQL and MySQL)
* Systems administration experience on Linux or other UNIX-type system
* Networking and communications programming and troubleshooting experience
* Web development experience
* Payment processing and/or financial application development expertise
