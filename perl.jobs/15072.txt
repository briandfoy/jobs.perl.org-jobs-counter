Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: güdTECH

Location: San Diego, CA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Solving problems is the name of the game. As a small, lean-and-mean tech
team, we're responsible for making the rubber hit the road with minimum
bullshit and pointy-headed management to get in the way. From
conceptualization, to implementation, to deployment, we do things a little
differently. If you want some cushy job where you trundle along not really
doing much of consequence, then this is not the job for you; However, if
you seek a challenge, not only in terms of personal growth but also the
ability to effect change, then read on!

You Should Be:
* A Great
communicator. Through precision, eloquence, and candor, we aspire to
greatness.
* A Self starter. Taking initiative and seeing things through to
completion is kind of our thing.
* Passionate about software. We believe
that passion for a quality product is the only way to achieve positive,
sustainable outcomes with software. You should too.

We Offer:
* Great
benefits - Full Medical, Dental, Vision, Cell Phone, Home Internet, Parking
/ Public Transit Reimbursement
* Great office location in downtown San
Diego with actual offices
* Positive culture with a focus on honesty,
vulnerability, and respect
* Startup-like environment with group
activities, games, snacks

Desired skills:
Gotta Haves:
* A strong sense of humility and willingness to learn (ego is
the enemy)
* An open-mind, sufficient to depart from mainstream orthodoxies
when necessary
* A robust understanding of foundational web technologies.
*
A firm grip of Computer Science core concepts
* Experience with at least
one of: perl, node.js, rust, golang, or C#
* Competency with Mysql, or
other RDBMS (and the willingness to abandon them)
* Competency with
ElasticSearch, or other eventual consistency document data stores
* The
ability to educate yourself as needed to get the job done (reading
whitepapers, etc)

Nice-to-haves:
* Proficiency with Perl, JavaScript,
ExtJS
* Experience with RabbitMQ, or other pub/sub middleware
* Experience
with high traffic, low latency environments
* Familiarity with middle-out
compression technology
