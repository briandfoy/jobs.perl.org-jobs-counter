Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £Excellent

Description:
We are currently seeking an experienced Perl Sybase developer to join a
small, dynamic and friendly team proving production support to a group of
traders working within a world renowned City based trading house.

This is an excellent opportunity for a highly-skilled Perl developer to
gain experience of working in a high pressured, exciting front office role.


You will have a university degree, with an excellent background in Perl and
Sybase development and will possess excellent interpersonal/team playing
skills. Prior knowledge of working within a front office/trading/finance
house is preferred, however, this is fantastic opportunity for a motivated
candidate without finance experience to join this dynamic development team.
C++ development skills are also desirable but not essential.
