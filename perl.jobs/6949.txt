Job title:
MacGyver-like Systems Engineer/SysAdmin, AIX to Z/OS and more

Company name: GridApp Systems, Inc.

Internal ID: Perl.org GA 708

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
“Do not, under any circumstances, walk into your sysadmin's cubicle and
announce "I have no problem, I just wanted to tell you what a wonderful job
you're doing" unless you want your sysadmin to drop dead from shock” 
~Unknown

Are you a Swiss Army Knife type of Systems Engineer, someone who offers the
creativity, intuitiveness and skills of a MacGyver? GridApp Systems is
looking for an equally creative, intuitive, and technically skilled person
to help build an extraordinarily diverse technology infrastructure that
supports our development and testing of our highly-acclaimed enterprise
database management software suite.

If you are like us, your idea of racks and appliances has nothing to do
with the kitchen but rather the architecture, design, and growth of a
technology infrastructure that ranks with the Fortune 100’s but with a
decidedly more hassle-free culture.

You will work with version-current enterprise technologies like VMWare,
Veritas, Oracle, NetApp, iSCSI, Fibre Channel, and a Who’s Who of operating
systems from AIX to Z/OS. Most start-ups don’t have these things but since
our customers‘ databases reside on every imaginable platform, we use our
internal technology infrastructure as a giant sandbox to develop and test
our products.

Please keep in mind that "required skills" always means there's flexibility
- anyone saying otherwise is not being straight with you. It will be up to
you to:

Deploy hundreds of environments in a cost effective, flexible manner

Incorporate new operating systems and other technologies into the
environment

Manage configurations of hundreds of hosts

Minimize incidents and downtimes as a result of unplanned infrastructure
changes...

While application development – Perl first, LAMP/C++ second - continues at
breakneck speeds.

The work environment – this is not a 24/7 position; you’re here when our
developers are here. Naturally, there may be times when you have to put in
the hours but you won’t be married to a pager or calling in for pizza
delivery at 4:00 AM. The development team is top shelf with a myriad of
personal interests that always seem to find their way into our daily
activities.

And if you do work at GridApp Systems, you will be well paid, will receive
benefits and stock options, and unlike quite a few companies these days, we
also provide relocation money for stellar candidates.

Come visit our website and see for yourself how our products help companies
manage their data resources smarter. Read the GridApp blog
(http://blog.gridapp.com) and leaf through the great industry, systems,
development, and career resources we’re assembling for you.

Here’s what will happen next – after you send me your resume, you will
receive a notification of your status within 24 hours. The next step might
be a phone interview. If this goes well, it’s an in-house, hands-on session
with our technical team. If you do well here, you know what comes next.

“The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a
little way past them into the impossible.”  ~Arthur C. Clarke’s Second Law

Required skills:
What you must have:

Ability to solve problems quickly and automate systems administration
processes; experience in a production service environment

2+ years experience as a UNIX Systems Administrator 

Experience with Linux, scripting (Perl, sh), TCP/IP networks

While you may not know all of the technologies we work with, your goal will
be to figure out the best way to manage, maintain, and extend the
performance of these resources including identifying needs and purchasing
new assets. If you are interested in working with new server, storage,
network, and infrastructure technologies, learning as you go, solving
problems in real-time, and planning for the future, this is the job for
you.

Desired skills:
Plusses...Experience with storage technologies (SAN, NAS, iSCSI); network
installations; Solaris/AIX/HP-UX; Oracle/Sybase/DB2; sysadmin in a
commercial software development environment
