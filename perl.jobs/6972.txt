Pay rate: £20,500 - £26,650

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute leads the world in genomic research,
with an expanding scientific programme dedicated to understanding gene
function in health & disease.
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute therefore has played a major role in
characterising human sequence variation (The SNP Consortium, HapMap
project). We are currently involved in large-scale studies (e.g. WTCCC) in
which we scan regional and genome-wide	
marker sets for association to susceptibility genes in a range of common  
diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
cancer. 

We are seeking an experienced Computer Biologist to provide data management
 
support for the laboratory and statistical groups involved in these
projects. 
Responsibilities will include; communicating with collaborators to assist 
with experimental design and to provide results and analysis, applying
quality
control measures to maintain the accuracy of the data produced, development

and maintenance of custom tools and assisting the lab members with problems
faced 
in the day to day running of the lab.


Required skills:
The ideal candidate will have a degree in the biological sciences and MSc 
or equivalent experience in bioinformatics. Experience of writing and 
maintaining Perl code in a UNIX/LINUX environment and using RDMS is
essential.Good communication skills are also essential as the role involves

working closely with lab scientists and collaborating with internal and 
external groups.  


Desired skills:
Experience of managing large biological data sets and a familiarity with
the 
statistical tests used for quality control and association analysis would
be 
an advantage.
