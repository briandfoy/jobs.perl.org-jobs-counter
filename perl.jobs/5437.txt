Description:
I manage a Technical Publications tools team at Apple, and am  
coordinating the search for a contract position.  This position will  
help another publications team transition to using the technology  
provided by my team.  The role involves:

- Helping a team new to XML/CSS/Formatting Objects come up to speed  
on these formats; in particular, working with production people to  
help them become self-sufficient.

- Customizing a Perl-based toolchain to meet this team's needs for  
HTML, PDF, and print production.

- Helping define the future publication strategy for the team.


Required skills:
People skills are an important factor.	You should have a strong grounding
in these technologies:

- Object-oriented Perl
- XML
- HTML/CSS
- Template-driven development

Desired skills:
You will need to use these technologies, but as long as you have a proven
ability to come up to speed or familiarity with similar technologies,
previous experience with them is not a requirement:

- Twig (Perl XML library)
- Template Toolkit
- RELAX NG
- Formatting Objects
