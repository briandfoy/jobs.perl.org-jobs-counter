Job title:
London's Trendiest Office Space - Lead and Mid-Level Perl Developer roles

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Unusually Excellent

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
I love working in a vibrant, modern space. If you’re going to spend all day
at work, it might as well be somewhere you enjoy being, rather than a
cubicle farm. This client has a workspace I’m actively jealous of!

With
hacking spaces themed after treehouses, wine cellars, and libraries, an
onsite fitness facilities, and close to London’s best foodie spots, if your
hacking requires beautiful but functional surroundings, you’re in luck.

Beyond the working space, it’s a large, well-organized, and growing team
with some of the UK’s biggest Perl names as employees and alumni. Your work
will be seen by millions of people around the UK, at scale. Development
practices are modern and effective.

Finally, it’s close to a major rail
station, so it’ll be an easy commute even if you don’t fancy living in the
Big Smoke itself.
