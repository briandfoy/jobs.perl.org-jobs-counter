Job title:
Programmer for new payment service provider (non-web/CGI based)

Company name: Vidicom Ltd.

Location: United Kingdom, Derbyshire, Chesterfield

Pay rate: 30-50k GBP depending on applicant

Travel: 25-50%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Vidicom is a small technology company currently undergoing rapid expansion.

Our main product is the world leading mobile payment platform Mobillcash.

We are currently looking for multiple programmers to work on our core
billing
platform, which is implemented as a series of daemon processes written in
Perl.

A successful candidate would be a good thinker and problem solver, as we
are
looking to recruit people who can weigh in heavily on design and
architecture
decisions. There will be interesting challenges to solve, such as improving

and expanding the distributed / decentralised nature of our system.

Experience with a variety of areas, programming challenges and languages
would
be beneficial. In particular, we'd like someone who may see things from a
stricter point of view than Perl itself actually enforces at times :)

We are looking for someone with many years general programming experience,
although this by no means must be in a professional capacity.
You should have at least 1 year of Perl experience in particular.

Required skills:
 - Perl application development experience.
 - An excellent level of Linux and/or general UNIX knowledge.
 - Knowledge of SQL.


Desired skills:
Not required, but nice to have:
 - mod_perl.
 - Distributed redundant systems development experience.
 - PHP experience (our front end reporting tools use this).
 - Knowledge of SMS internals / industry.
