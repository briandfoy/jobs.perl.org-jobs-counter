Description:
Perl Software Engineer ~ Highly Adept at Capturing ContentSavvy Software
Engineers with solid Perl programming skills on both Unix/Linux and Windows
have an exceptional opportunity to broaden and deepen their skills in
processing content provider APIs and feeds in a highly visible role for
Business.com, the premier internet B2B directory and search engine, and for
DexKnows.com, the leading provider of local commercial search. Join an
elite and motivated team in our Content Technology group where your elegant
and highly efficient Perl code will allow you to contribute to the
development and management of content systems and internal tools. This is
an ideal role for the programmer who loves variety ~ content projects
change frequently and tend to require custom coding on a per-data-source
basis. You'll also be given a great measure of autonomy in terms of how you
do your coding, affording you the freedom to uncover innovative solutions
to acquire and process content. If you want an opportunity to test your
mettle and accelerate the trajectory of your software development career,
then take step one in advancing your technical capabilities to the next
level at Business.com. We offer competitive compensation, health, dental,
vision, 20 days of PTO, 401(k) + matching, educational reimbursement &
more.
Business.com, part of Dex One Interactive, has been named among the Best
Places to Work by the Los Angeles Business Journal for three years running;
2007, 2008 and 2009! Our environment fosters excellence through team work,
creativity, and integrity.  We offer competitive compensation, health,
dental, vision, 20 days of PTO, 401(k) + matching, educational
reimbursement & more!

Dex One Interactive is responsible for the development and management of
two flagship properties; www.DexKnows.com and www.Business.com.

DexKnows.com, is a cornerstone of our marketing services that help local
businesses get found and selected by active shoppers, generating high
quality, targeted, ready-to-buy leads.

Our B2B property, www.Business.com, is the leading business directory and
pay-per-click advertising network, which helps business decision-makers
quickly find whatever they need to manage and grow their businesses.  Our
Business.com search engine was named to the Inc. 500 in 2006 and to BtoB
Media Power 50 and Deloitte Technology Fast 500 in 2007.

As our Santa Monica, CA-based Perl Software Engineer, you'll hit the ground
running by writing code on one of our content enrichment projects.  Besides
a comfort with web services, your flexibility in knowing how to retrieve
and parse content from XML feeds, databases, spreadsheets or FTP sites will
be key. What distinguishes programmers in this role, and speaks to their
craft and skill, is their ingenuity in writing advanced code that may
include incorporating forked processes and third-party modules to increase
efficiency. Once you are able to retrieve the content, your job is to parse
it, extract the relevant data, insert it into an MS SQL Server or MySQL
database and make it available for access.  The sheer volume and variety of
the content we add to our public sites is immense, so finding efficiencies
in your work will be a clear marker of success. 

Additionally we may look to you to write stored procedures and triggers in
SQL or to backward-engineer or refactor existing code. As you interface
with other internal departments and stakeholders, a customer service
centric mindset and plain speaking will be essential, especially as you may
need to explain technical concepts to a non-technical audience at times. If
you're not just willing to learn, but enthusiastic about the prospects of
adding heft to your career portfolio, this is the place to be.	We're a
highly collaborative and motivated group that will recognize and reward
your ideas and insights.
