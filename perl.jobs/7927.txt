Job title: Web Application Senior Software Engineer

Company name: Pearson

Internal ID: CTG-178

Location: United States, MA, Boston

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Web Application Senior Software Engineer
Location: Boston, MA
Company: Pearson – www.pearson.com 
Products: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry, MasteringAstronomy,
MasteringBiology
	

POSITION SUMMARY:
Technology is transforming the way we educate students.  Pearson
understands this fact, and it is committed to playing a leadership role in
the transformation.  The software development group you would be joining,
referred to internally at Pearson as the “Mastering” team, is responsible
for an online homework / tutoring system for college science students.	The
specific products are called: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry,
MasteringAstronomy, and MasteringBiology.  We are extremely proud of these
products – they are based on educational research done at M.I.T. and they
have proven very effective.

The Mastering product line is built on top of standard web technology:
Perl, Flash, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, MySQL, and Apache.  It is a
high-throughput database application that services hundreds of thousands of
students.

We are currently looking for a senior web developer to help with both the
design and implementation of the our platform.	We are expecting continued
rapid growth in usage of the platform as well as continued demands for new
functionality.	To satisfy these demands we will need to continually
refactor the application as well as build entirely new subsystems.

We are most interested in raw intelligence, deep web application
experience, and a go-anywhere, do-anything attitude.  We are looking for
someone who is happiest when the entire codebase is his/her playground. 
That is, we are not looking for a specialist at this time.  This is not to
say that expertise in our toolset is not also important, but it takes a
back seat to overall web application smarts and attitude.

The office is on Arlington Street at the corner of the Boston Public
Garden.  The environment is professional, but relaxed and flexible.  The
emphasis is on getting good work done effectively rather than on adhering
to someone’s idea of perfect process.  It is a small development team.	You
can have a major impact on the team dynamics and the product’s evolution.  


If you would like to know more about our products, take a look at the
websites for each product:
•	www.masteringphysics.com	(click on the “Listen to Dr. David
Pritchard” link)
•	www.masteringchemistry.com
•	www.masteringastronomy.com,
•	www.masteringbiology.com


Required skills:
QUALIFICATIONS:
•	Web application design and implementation expertise
•	Perl (or equivalent) expertise
•	Software Engineering Background 
•	Smart, Dedicated, Team Player
•	Comfortable working on a large (but organized) software project
•	Experience with multi-tier, high-throughput web applications
•	Database programming experience, working knowledge of SQL

•	Science, Engineering, and/or Math background is a plus
•	Educational / Teaching background is a plus 
•	Experience with mod-perl is a plus
•	Experience with the general Open Source toolset is a plus
