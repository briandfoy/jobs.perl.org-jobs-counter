Hi,
	I would like to announce my availability for telecommute
development work.  I have experience with Perl, including DBI, XML
parsing, mod_perl, traditional CGI, Perl/Tk, network programming, and
threads.  I have worked on Linux/Apache/MySQL and also have experience
with PHP and Java.  For more information see my resume at:

Thanks,

dave
