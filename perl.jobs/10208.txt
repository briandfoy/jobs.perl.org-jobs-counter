Job title: Perl/CGI Web Developer Contract

Company name: Webscheduler LLC

Location: United States, CA, Oakland

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Webscheduler is looking for an *experienced* perl developer to inherit the
code base of webscheduler.net, a 12 year old profitable business to
business subscription-based web application.

You will be paid for the opportunity to get familiar with the code base.
We're looking to establish a long-term relationship that requires
occasional part-time development work.
Understanding the existing code is more important than the impulse/ability
to rewrite it.
Months may pass between assignments.

The existing app has a solid structure. You will be modifying the existing
app, not rewriting it wholesale (until it makes business sense to do so).
To date we have not outgrown the original design.

New customers can be added and configured without developer involvement.
If a new customer requests (and is willing to pay for the mods) features
not present in the app, you would be called on to estimate the extent of
the modification before performing them.

The application runs on a single FreeBSD 7.2 server in a managed hosting
account

There are 4 mysql databases with a total 400MB of data in the databases.
The largest db has 200 MB of data and the largest table has 400k rows with
most tables under 10k rows. There are 20 database tables per customer.

You will work with an experienced sysadmin.

You will be expected to setup a local dev site for your personal
development and testing.
Choice of source control and development tools are left to you.
We use git for producing daily diffs of what changed in the customer
database tables.

Webscheduler is a virtual company with the principals located in the SF bay
area (East Bay) and you will be required to travel for an initial meeting
with the Managing Partner. After that initial meeting, telecommuting is OK
and the norm.

Required skills:
perl CGI

DBI::mysql

knowledge anonymous hashes and dereferencing them

Web 1.0 application techniques

CGI::Sessions

creating custom perl modules

HTML/CSS/JS

Desired skills:
patience and good debugging skills are a plus.

jQuery - some of the user interface has been refreshed recently by using
jQuery.

knowledge of BSD is a plus (mostly awareness of the differences between
command line options of BSD utilities and GNU versions) but not a
requirement

git version control
