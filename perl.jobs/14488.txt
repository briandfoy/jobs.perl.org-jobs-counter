Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: Broadbean Technology

Location: Canary Wharf, London, UK

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We're looking for a talented Senior Developer to join our team in our
lovely Canary Wharf offices. You'll be working on a mixtures of new and
less new codebases, you'll be able to influence the technologies we use,
and will be partly responsible for the architecture of the resulting
products. 

We build a Software As A Service product for recruiters, and have 60%-70%
of the UK market depending on who you ask. We're a smallish company (90
people in the UK, 40 in California, a handful in Sydney) owned by a much
larger company. Post-probation we offer (non-contractually, to permanent
staff) flexible working and 50% telecommuting. We've got a development team
of 30 and are fully committed to Perl, clearing our technical debt, and
doing things the right way moving forward...

We have a number of members of the London Perl Mongers working with us, and
we'll hopefully be sending a fair contingent to YAPC this year, so if
you're a Perl person through and through, you'll be amongst friends.

Required skills:
You'll need to show proof of strong and "Modern" Perl - at least
familiarity with various testing modules, exposure to Moose would be
useful. You should have opinions that you can justify on the "right" level
of testing, and the pros and cons of continuous delivery. You can take a
stab at the philosophical differences between Catalyst, Dancer, and
Mojolicious.
