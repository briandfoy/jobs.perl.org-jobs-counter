Description:
Binary.com, the leading binary options website, is recruiting for
experienced Perl developers to join its onsite development team in
Cyberjaya, Malaysia.

Binary.com is a fast-growing binary options group,
founded in 1999, and employing about 60 people worldwide. The company
trades in over US$ 600 million of option transactions per annum and

Due to recent growth in the business, we

recruit from all over the world and have a very international team, and we
arrange for work permits, relocation, and visas for family members.

Our
development teams benefit from a fast-paced working culture focused on
getting things done, with a flat hierarchy, flexi-time, casual-dress, and
other liberal working policies, designed to allow developers to perform

Our office is located in

employees benefit from the advantages of living in Malaysia, such as
exciting weekend-trip destinations, a multi-cultural yet English-speaking
environment, a low cost of living, and easy access to innumerable holiday
destinations around Asia.

Desired skills:
We are seeking Perl experts and enthusiasts. We expect you to be highly
proficient with modern object-oriented Perl development, and to have good
experience with technologies such as Javascript/CSS/HTML5, Postgres, Redis,
git, Travis, and Linux in general.
