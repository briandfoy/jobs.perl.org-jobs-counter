Description:
We're looking for another person for our international team of programmers

Required skills:
- Enterprise experience with Perl / mod_perl

Contact information:
Write a convincing letter explaining why you should be chosen for the
position. Persuade us into hiring you!

E-mail it to stephan+jobs@opera.com.

Here's some hints, in case you can't come up with something yourself:
Pointers to previous work you're proud of, rants on Apache internals, great
modules, submitting structured code that actually does something useful
(even if it is fetching cartoons).

In other words, show us what you're good for. Also mention where you're
from, when you could potentially start, and a bit about who you are.
