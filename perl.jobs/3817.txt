Job title:
Perl Help Wanted for business automation scripting - In or Near Louisville,
Ky Kentucky

Company name: Intellispire

Location: United States, Kentucky, Louisville

Pay rate: Let's talk

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
I’m looking for someone to partner with, locally, as my primary systems
developer here in Louisville, Ky 

The person I'm looking for will be responsible for scripting the business
process of medium sized LAMP (Linux / Apache/ MySQL / Perl) applications,
based on the Mason framework.

Specifically, we need to create an automated subversion system that runs
regression testing via cron. We also need to automate as much of the
business aspects of the development process as possible, from checking in
code through deployment, some general systems administration, and helping
contractors with the "hard stuff".

I expect we’d meet 1-2 times per week at a local hotspot or conference room
(maybe the UofL ITEC at the Shelbyville Rd. Campus?), but other than that
work from our own space.

There are some really big, exciting projects coming down the pike, and
looking to flush out my development management team. 

Experience is mandatory: I prefer someone who has a bachelors or masters in
computer science or a related field, though having successfully completed
multi-person software projects - especially as a project lead and using a
virtual company model on the web - counts for far more.

Compensation to be discussed when we meet.


Required skills:
Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl, Mason, the UML, subversion, sysadmin, project
lead

Desired skills:
(all nice to have)
project management, testing, advanced systems administration, database
replication, clustering, failover technologies, security and hardening,
"High Availability on the Cheap"
