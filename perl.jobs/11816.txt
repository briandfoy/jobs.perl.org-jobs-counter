Job title: Android Mobile E-Wallet / Closed Loop Gift Card

Company name: 2kms

Location: El Salvador, Central America

Pay rate: open

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hello:

Seems that lately people are getting brave enough to experiment using perl
for mobile applications.

I run into some examples at:
http://szabgab.com/blog/2010/05/perl-on-android.html
http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=874223
http://code.google.com/p/perldroid
http://code.google.com/p/perl-mobile-wurfl
https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/android
http://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/~pnb/mobileagents.pdf

I have also seen how some developers are creating ways of including perl
and your scripts into a compiled exe file, which could be ported to other
OS besides Linux.

I'm really not a perl expert myself neither a java or mobile app developer,
so attempting to create a Mobile App using perl might be totally off the
wall.. but perhaps is feasible.

If you have already experimented with some kind of success.. here is your
chance to make a buck.

I'm looking to create an app that will do transactions via a cell phone
using QR barcode but it won't echange real money, instead we will exchange
loyalty points, as in a Closed Loop Gift Card Program.

Here is a quick example of a similar app:

If you are bored and you are a cell phone, tablet enthusiast, here is
essentially what is needed, which is very simple beacuse we don't have to
tye up to banks or credit cards for top-ups, withdrawals or transfers:

1) Create a database in a webserver
2) Code a "Create User Account" function in mobile app.
3) Code a "Credit Account" function in mobile app.
4) Code a "Debit Account" function in mobile app.
5) Code an "Account to Account Transfer" function in mobile app.

That's it. Send me a nice quote, this is for telecommuting, offsite,
freelance paid per project not hourly.

I'm online most days from 7:00 am Eastern Time for a Skype chat.

Lets do it..

Required skills: mobile OS knowledge

Desired skills: able to work with online emulators
