Job title: Perl developer

Company name: Intel

Location: Santa Clara, CA, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
This position is in the mask metrology group at Intel Mask Operations
(IMO), the mask factory for Intel Corporation. We need someone to help us
with maintenance and re-engineering of a legacy Perl application to
generate recipe files used by various measurement tools in our factory. 
This position is not in a software group and will require the ability to do
work independently although you will be expected to collaborate with the
automation software group at IMO. As this is a production manufacturing
environment we have relatively strict control over any changes to
automation software so some tolerance of the associated bureaucracy would
be helpful. 
The position is only available for recent college graduates
(less than 18 months out of school) with permission to work in the United
States.

Desired skills:
Perl. Experience working with large, mission critical, poorly documented
legacy applications is preferred. Some knowledge of C/C++ and CAD software
would be helpful but is not required.
