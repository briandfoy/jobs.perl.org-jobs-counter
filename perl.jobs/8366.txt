Description:
This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor with a rapidly
growing company. ftwilliam.com is looking for someone interested in
becoming an integral part of our team with great potential for growth.

Using an Application Service Provider model, we offer software that
dynamically generates documents and forms via the internet to businesses in
the employee benefits industry. The documents we create are most typically
retirement plan legal documents (401(k) plan documents, for example). In
addition, the forms we create are typically used to report tax information
to the IRS. This means that changes/updates to the website must be
thoroughly tested and working properly before being deployed.

We work on short implementation cycles and we are always looking for new
ways to improve our products and create new offerings (i.e. make our
customers' lives easier).

The candidate will work primarily as a software developer in a "LAMP"
(Linux, Apache, mySQL, Perl) environment. The position requires customer
service skills to consult with customers and to train some customers on the
advanced, technical aspects of the website.

Casual and flexible work environment. Full Time position. Excellent benefit
package. Office locations in Milwaukee or Madison (with some travel to
Milwaukee required).

Required skills:
- familiarity with LAMP (Linux, Apache, mySQL, Perl)

Bachelor's Degree or equivalent experience required.

Desired skills:
Desired extras/pluses:
