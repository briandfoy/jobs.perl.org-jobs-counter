Job title: Software Engineer for Digital Archive Service

Company name: Internet Archive

Internal ID: digarchive

Location: United States, CA, San Francisco

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Internet Archive is building a new, hosted Digital Archiving service to
be launched in 2011 that will provide storage, maintenance and access for
the digital collections of memory institutions. The Digital Archive
Engineer will be a key player on a small team of people building this
service from the ground up.

This new service will interact with several existing projects at the
Internet Archive, requiring the ability to understand and integrate
technologies written in several different programming languages. The ideal
candidate must therefore be resourceful, flexible and enjoy working on a
highly collaborative but loosely structured team.

You will help us define the parameters of the service, figure out how to
ingest media files from partner institutions and other storage systems and
build methods for patrons to access the materials. Your work will range
from back end to middleware right on up to the user interface but will
initially focus on design and development of the Digital Archive API (in
Perl or whichever language makes the most sense for the project).

This position is based in San Francisco, CA. We cannot consider
telecommuters at this time.

Applicants must be able to work in the United States. We are unable to
sponsor work visas at this time.

We are an equal opportunity employer. The Archive thanks all applicants for
their interest, but advises that only those selected for an interview will
be contacted. No phone calls please.

The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an
Internet library. Its purposes include offering permanent access for
researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities, and the
general public to historical collections that exist in digital format. Now
the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as
well as archived web pages in our collections, and provides specialized
services for adaptive reading and information access for the blind and
other persons with disabilities. Internet Archive is the home of services
such as OpenLibrary, the Wayback Machine and Archive-It along with several
other open source projects.


Required skills:

* A strong commitment to the goals and values of the Internet Archive
mission
* Several years of recent, hands-on software development experience
* Experience both designing and implementing APIs for both public and
internal use
* Must be able to communicate clearly and effectively with coworkers and
partners of all technical levels
* Knowledge of basic Linux system administration
* Fluency in at least one scripting language like shell or Perl


Desired skills:

* Strong knowledge of web development technologies including HTML, CSS,
etc.
* Ability to work in--and enjoy--a loosely structured work environment
* Experience with one or more common web development programming language
(PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.)
* A strong appreciation for and at least basic understanding of UI and UX
design
* Experience with JavaScript, including but not limited to one or more
common JavaScript frameworks such as JQuery or Sencha/extJS
* Experience building user-facing media or information portals
* Software development experience in Java (server and UI)
* Knowledge of deployment of web applications and services (hands-on
experience strongly preferred) Experience working with libraries or other
metadata-heavy institutions or processes
