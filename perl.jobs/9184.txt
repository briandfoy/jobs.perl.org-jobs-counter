Perl Software Development Engineer, Infrastructure Automation

Are you ready to create systems to power one of the largest e-commerce
companies in the world? My client has over 70 
million customers, and developers all over the world rely on their storage,
compute, and virtualized services via their Web 
Services. Their success depends on their world-class network and hardware
infrastructure; they're handling massive 
scale and rapid integration of emergent technologies. Their goal is to
become "The Infrastructure Platform" for the world. 
The Infrastructure Automation team is responsible for delivering the
software that powers their infrastructure, and 
they're're looking for Software Development Engineers to deliver the next

As a Software Development Engineer for Infrastructure Automation you'll be

My client to drive web services, operate their infrastructure, and provide
an interface for customers (both internal and 
external) to consume infrastructure directly without human intervention.
You'll drive a step-change in My client's ability to 
deploy, manage and monitor network availability, routing and flows by
creating software that automates routine decisions

huge scales, and you'll have a proven record of delivering highly operable
and maintainable software on time. You'll have 
relentlessly high standards for yourself and everyone you work with; you'll
drive engineering best practices throughout 
your team and you'll be constantly looking for ways to make the systems you
own better. You'll be intensely customer 
focused: you understand your customers' challenges and are constantly
looking for ways to solve them. You have great 
communication skills, and enjoy working in a fast-paced, collaborative team
environment. 
Your education and experience include: 

· BS degree or higher in Computer Science with 5+ years of relevant, broad
engineering experience
