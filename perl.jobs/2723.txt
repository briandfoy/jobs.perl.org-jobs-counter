Description:
We're still growing!

For those of you who know our job postings, you're used to seeing a
requirement of heavy-duty perl coding experience. While we love perl
engineers, and are not discouraging you talented camel-people from
applying, we're also eager to speak with "classic" software engineers with
C/C++ expertise.

In this role, you'll develop core back-end technologies for a leader in
open-source, high-volume, high-transaction web systems. As part of
Ticketmaster product development group, you will be responsible for
integrating new functionality into our existing code base, with an emphasis
on perl development, as well as aiding in the architecture, design, and
implementation of new core technologies. If you love perl/mod_perl, you'll
fit right in! If you're a solid engineer but would need to "bone up" on
perl, then please do contact us. We're looking for smart, capable,
engineers.

What's in it for you? We provide an excellent work environment where
talented engineers get the chance to use their skills, knowledge, and
abilities to their utmost. We staff our teams with top talent at all levels
so you'll be surrounded by interesting, smart people who enjoy each other's
company and get the job done. Our compensation is competitive and our work
location is in the heart of West Hollywood surrounded by great restaurants,
etc. Besides, I found the best pizza in LA right up the street (and I'm
from NY so I know pizza!).
