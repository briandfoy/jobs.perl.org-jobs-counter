Job title: Perl Developer/Architect/Leader Wanted

Company name: Elite Digital

Location: Los Angeles, CA

Pay rate: $100k - $125k USD + Bonus

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Elite Digital is a small company of 25 employees specializing in the sale
of media through online channels. We work behind the scenes to sell
millions of different products around the world. If you've ever bought a
rare book or cd through Amazon, you probably bought it from us.

We've been
in the industry for more than 10 years, so we are an established company
but we still have that scrappy startup spirit. We currently have a single
developer handling our entire system, which consists of 150k lines of Perl
running on 50 machines.

Your primary role will be leading strategic
development efforts and guiding the evolution of our systems. Your
secondary role will be assisting with operational support (occasionally
after-hours). You will wear many hats in this position: project manager,
system administrator, architect, devops, software developer, and more.
You'll have the opportunity to tackle some challenging analytical and
architectural problems at scale. You'll get to make big decisions and your
work will have a visible impact on the bottom line, every day.

This is a
100% telecommute position, but candidates must be located in the US,
ideally in the Los Angeles area. We especially like people who can show us
their work on GitHub, StackOverflow, or CPAN.

Desired skills:
Must Haves:

* Object-Oriented Perl (6+ years) and fluent with CPAN.

*
MySQL administration, schema design, queries, and optimization.

* Linux
System administration via command line (RHEL or equivalent).

* Navigating,
enhancing, refactoring, and testing legacy code.

* Prior success working
in a telecommute position.

* Two or more professional references.

* Play
well with others.


Nice To Have:

* Familiarity with Amazon AWS, MWS, EC2,
SQS.

* Good understanding of Unicode in relation to Perl and MySQL.

*
Experience with automating web interaction / web scraping.

* Moose, DBI,
NYTProf.
