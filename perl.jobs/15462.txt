Job description 

You will be

As an Agile coach you will be working with the team and
empowering them to iteratively improve upon their processes to increase
visibility, teamwork and cooperation, quality and throughput. You will
always be seeking to identify MVP, advocating releasing early and often,
and reducing time to market while also reducing risk through effective
testing strategies. You will work closely with the development teams
throughout in order to help them remove bottlenecks and reduce frustrations
with existing process and toolchain.

Key Responsibilities: 

●

delivery progress against estimates and product roadmaps
●      
Highlighting and communicating risk around project delays
●      
Facilitating teams in providing realistic estimates, and measuring velocity
●	Removing impediments to sprint and release goals
●	Managing
coordination with other teams and business units in order to minimise
delays and drive projects to completion
●	Track time spent by teams
on non-project tasks and ad-hoc requests. Work with development teams and
management to find ways to predict and mitigate these kinds of requests.
● 
     Agile Coach
●	Facilitating teams in identifying and resolving
process inefficiencies.
●	Helping teams be self-organising, and high
quality

Desired skills:
●	Excellent communication and ability to discuss tasks to a level of
detail appropriate to audience
●	Understanding of different software
development management processes. Should be able to describe the
differences between, for example, Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban and have stong
opinions on when each approach might be effective.
●	Experience
working with software development teams. Technically minded in order to
understand developer challenges and communicate them effectively outside of
the team.
