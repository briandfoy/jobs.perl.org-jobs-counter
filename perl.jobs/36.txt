Subject: London, UK - Perl Developers (Permanent)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: aef@chalk.oaktree.net.uk (AEF)


 Ok, this is a somewhat unofficial advert on behalf of the company I work
for. It's an Internet publishing company based a few minutes walk from
Highbury & Islington station (Victoria Line, National Rail). We[1] have
been around for a few years, have funding and are selling real services to
real clients. (I think some actual profits may be involved - but don't
quote me on that.)

 We are looking for two junior Perl coders and one more senior developer.
The current system is Linux & Solaris/Apache/Perl/MySQL. Java technologies
and a commercial DB may be used in the nearish future, and we want people
who are prepared to work with that.

 The two junior roles would suit recent graduates with some experience
with Unix/Linux, Perl, SQL (other applicable skills a plus). The more
senior role is aimed at someone with non-trivial experience of commercial
Perl development, with some skills and experience in the other
technologies mentioned above.

 If interested, please send details/questions to me, and I'll pass them on
to the appropriate person. Please don't respond to this if you are a
recruitment agency/consultancy/etc.

 Thanks,

 Tony Fisher

[1] The company, in case you missed the change in context.
