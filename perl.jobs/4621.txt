Description:
Spire Vision has an opening for a Perl developer with MySQL, Email and
Linux/Unix skills to work onsite in midtown, New York City. We're seeking a
programmer with the ability to customize and maintain large scale, open
source and home-grown applications for enterprise use. The development
process is not formalized and you will be required to wear several hats at
times, and be involved from analysis and design through testing,
implementation and support of live systems. 

We are looking for a very smart, technically adept information architect to
manage, plan, and implement the networking connections between the many
divisions, products, and clients of our email marketing agency.  We need
someone to visualize and plan how to structure the connections between
various web sites, servers, client databases, mailing lists, email
management systems, etc.


Responsibilities will include:

•	Strategy:  improving efficiency and new features for our
proprietary emailing system
•	Integrating third party systems into our proprietary emailing
system
•	Analyze e-mail distribution tracking and reporting and determine an
in-depth program on improving deliverability, open rate, and click-thru
based on both content, user's technical capabilities including email
platforms and web browser type. 
•	Oversee daily launch of emails to ensure deliverability and
identify any potential and particular problems with ISPs blocking email. 
•	Participate in technical conferences and diligently follow market
to keep up-to-speed on internal needs. 


Required skills:
• Unix/Linux/Open Source approach to systems deployment and software
development. 
• Proficient in Perl for both mod_perl application interface development
and backend data-processing. 
• Ability to maintain our servers (running Linux using the Apache
webserver) as well as provision new servers (you must have experience
administering servers, changing hosting companies, migrating from one
server to another, etc). 
• Experienced in HTML, Javascript, Perl, PHP, MySQL, DNS, Apache Servers
and Unix -- systems administration experience required. 
• Email processing and experience with qmail preferred, but not critical if
you’re willing to learn it. 


Desired skills:
• Creative approach to problem solving and can-do attitude. 
• Ability to check and troubleshoot your own work is critical. 
• Ability to interface directly with non-technical end-users. 
• Self-starter who can work independently while managing your resources to
complete tasks in a timely manner.
