Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Lumesse

Location: Luton, UK (remote working possible)

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for a full time developer to join the R&D team working on
our Recruitment Platform 'EasyCruit'. The role will encompass the full
development life cycle from design to deployment.

Our products are
developed using open source technology and based upon a LAMP stack, so you
will be expected to have at least 3 years' experience of writing web
applications using Perl and MySQL, deployed on Apache Web servers in a
Linux environment. You will have experience using Source Code management
tools and will be expected to participate in peer code reviews providing
constructive feedback, and be prepared to receive the same.

Developers
will be required to produce technical documentation and accurate estimates
so excellent levels of written and verbal English are required. The role
also includes a proportion of bug fixing, so you will need an intelligent
approach to problem solving and analysis.

Desired skills:
Essential Requirements:

    Previous use of Perl / mod_perl, Apache and
MySQL to create web based applications. You should have used Perl modules
and packages created by others and written your own.
    Experience of
producing web pages in HTML and CSS. Ultimately Easycruit renders its pages
in HTML, so being able to produce 'standards compliant' HTML is a must for
this role.
    Ability to support systems and applications in a Linux
environment.
    Previous experience deploying SaaS software in a
multi-lingual, multi-site and multi-country environment.

Desirable
attributes:

    Good understanding of data exchange using SOAP, XML and
Web Services.
    Development of web content in HTML5 and use of responsive
layouts to render data correctly on different devices.
    Experience in a
QA environment or testing of software.
    An understanding of the security
needed for web applications.
