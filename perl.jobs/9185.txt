Development driven Software Test Engineer

Location: Dublin

Software Development Engineer -- Test, Infrastructure Automation Are you
ready to create systems to power one of the 
largest e-commerce companies in the world?  My client has over 70 million
customers, and developers all over the world 
rely on their storage, compute, and virtualized services via their Web
Services.  Their success depends on our world-
class network and hardware infrastructure; they're handling massive scale
and rapid integration of emergent 
technologies. Their goal is to become "The Infrastructure Platform" for the
world.	The Infrastructure Automation team is 
responsible for delivering the software that powers their infrastructure,
and they're looking for Software Development 
Engineers to deliver the next generation of Infrastructure Automation.

As a Software Development Engineer in Test for Infrastructure Automation
you'll be building and operating systems that 
enable my client to drive their web services, operate their infrastructure,
and provide an interface for customers (both 
internal and external) to consume infrastructure directly without human
intervention.  You'll drive a step-change in my 
clients ability to deploy, manage and monitor network availability, routing
and flows by creating software that automates 
routine decisions and provides fast easy access to data to guide all other
decisions.   You'll simplify load balancing 
solutions, provide internal and external customers with great tools to
select and optimize load balancing solutions, and 
will automate management of load balancing solutions.  

The ideal candidate will be a passionate advocate for quality at all phases
of the software development process, from 
design through to launch and upgrade. You'll have a proven record of
delivering test software and test automation, 
including build verification and regression tests, design and automation of
test cases, white and black box tests, and 
creating testing tools. You'll have relentlessly high standards for
yourself and everyone you work with; you'll drive 
engineering best practices throughout your team and you'll be constantly
looking for ways to make the systems you own 
better.   You have great communication skills, and enjoy working in a
fast-paced, collaborative team environment. 

Your education and experience include:
•	BS degree or higher in Computer Science with several years of
relevant, broad engineering experience, including 
several years experience in testing
•	Significant experience programming in Perl
•	Experience with C++ or Java in a Linux environment
•	Familiarity with web services, virtual machines, SOAP, XML, MySQL,
LDAP, and object oriented methodologies

Required skills:
Perl,
test software and test automation, including build verification and
regression tests, design and automation of test cases, white and black box
tests, and creating testing tools. 

Desired skills:
Java OR C++,
Familiarity with web services, virtual machines, SOAP, XML, MySQL, LDAP,
and object oriented methodologies
