Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: P1

Location: United States, CA, Mission Viejo

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. programs and hosts online surveys for a variety of
clients in the market research industry. We offer both software licensing
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we program surveys
using our own software on a project-by-project basis for clients who would
rather outsource all survey set up.

Our core software is built using Perl, mod_perl, DBI, and Apache running on
Linux servers. We need experienced software engineers to help us expand and
improve on our core software.

Required skills:
The software engineer will learn our overall system architecture as quickly
as possible and then help us continually expand and improve our systems by
writing modular, clean code. In addition the person will be asked to assist
with client projects from time to time, particularly on more difficult
custom jobs, so excellent communication skills are also needed.

Object-oriented Perl, mod_perl, DBI and PostgreSQL are the primary skills
the employee will be using day to day. However the ability to learn quickly
and adapt is more important than any particular technical skill.

Desired skills:
- The ability to set up hardware (for example, installing all necessary
software on a new Linux server) and some level of networking expertise.
- The ability to understand our business and suggest ways to leverage our
current technology.
- The ability to work independently
