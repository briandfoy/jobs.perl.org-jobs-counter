Job title:
UNIX is my IDE. perl5 is my VM. CPAN is my language

Company name: Edument AB

Location: Malmö, Sweden

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for a developer with an eye both for detail and for the big
picture. To work on the kind of problems where Perl shines (text
processing, glue language, data conversion) in interesting domains that
matter to people.

At Edument, we have found Perl programmers to be
passionate about their craft, responsible, knowledgeable, and versatile. We
want a certain kind of free-thinking problem-solving mindset, and we've
found a good way to do that is to hire Perl programmers.

The quote above
(by Matt Trout, mst) nicely conveys the spirit we find in well-versed Perl
people: a natural reliance on CPAN, and a familiarity with the usual UNIX
toolkit. If you're a regular at Perl conferences or workshops, we count
that as a plus.

Of course, in 2016 a developer is also expected to have at
least a passing knowledge of other scripting languages, some web
development, and perhaps a mainstream static language or two. We've found
this is true of many Perl developers we interview: they're really polyglot
programmers.

Though the main occupation is developing code, in practice a
lot of the daily work involves communication: discussion, teaching,
mentoring, learning, exchanging ideas. A mastery of spoken and written
English on a C1 or C2 level is highly recommended.

Place of employment is
in Helsingborg or Malmö. We welcome people both from Sweden and abroad.
(Already our company is a fairly even mix.) Relocating to the greater
Copenhagen region is encouraged, but we have been known to make exceptions
to this rule if we find it makes sense.

Job applications are
first-come-first-serve, so send in your application as soon as you can.

When we meet for an interview, the topics will be not just your skills, but
your other interests and passions. Likely the interview will consist of one
person from the business side and one technical person. There will not be a
whiteboard or live coding, just talk to get to know you as a person.
