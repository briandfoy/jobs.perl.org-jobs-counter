Job title: Perl Software Engineer

Company name: ZipRecruiter

Location: Santa Monica, CA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
ZipRecruiter is looking to expand our engineering team.

Our goal is to create the best online services for filling and finding
jobs. We bootstrapped for the first four years, growing to 100+ employees.
Recently, we raised $63M led by Institutional Venture Partners.

We help employers and recruiters distribute their jobs online and screen
their applicants. We also provide job search engine and job alert email
services to job boards and related companies. We have a large number of
paying customers and job seekers using our services. You will have the
opportunity to lead significant projects. We pay market competitive
salaries and offer generous cash bonuses and equity. We are more laid back
than the average startup and more fun than the average BigCo - we're fans
of 37signals and we emulate a lot of what they talk about.

We're looking for strong generalist engineers who are happy to learn new
technologies, and are willing to think like product/business people who
personally implement software.

Technologies we use:

Perl, Python, MySQL, Amazon AWS, Solr

While we would prefer that you join us here in our offices in Santa Monica,
we are open to telecommuting for this position.

Required skills:
- Superb software design and development skills

- Experience with general web development and programming in a Linux
environment

- Some experience with Perl, or a similar language such that you could pick
it up quickly.

Desired skills:
- search engine or machine learning experience

- experience with EC2 and other AWS technologies

- experience with MySQL
