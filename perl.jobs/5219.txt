Location:
United States, CA, Westlake Village or Santa Barbara

Pay rate: DOE

Description:
As our Perl Developer based in either our Santa Barbara, CA or Westlake
Village, CA office you will work with some of the greatest minds in the
Perl engineering community developing and optimizing Perl / mod_perl code
to contribute significantly to our high-performance systems. If you enjoy
problem solving and learning, then our innovative and collaborative
environment will serve as a ladder for your professional development.
ValueClick recently sponsored Dr. Damian Conway at the YAPC and he also
attended our on-site Perl Monger meeting - we plan on more of these
exciting experiences for our team.

ValueClick Media's network of web sites offers online branding and
direct-response marketers the ability to reach over 70 percent of all
Internet users. The depth of this reach, combined with advanced targeting
and automated optimization capabilities, provides advertisers with a
variety of solutions to attain the highest return for their online
marketing campaigns. ValueClick Media also provides publishers with
powerful inventory management tools to maximize control and flexibility,
ensuring the maximum revenue and customer experience for their site. In
September 2005, the former Fastclick was acquired by ValueClick, Inc.
(Nasdaq:VCLK). ValueClick, Inc. is the single-source provider of media,
technology and related services that enable advertisers, agencies and web
site owners to reach consumers in all major online marketing channels.
ValueClick was just named one of the top ten fastest growing technology
companies by Business 2.0 and we debuted at 55 out of the top 100 for the
Hot Growth Companies recognized by BusinessWeek!

Required skills:
As our Perl Developer your mission will be to manage the full lifecycle
development of projects, including developing software functional
specifications based on product requirements, writing code to accomplish
specific goals and assisting in preparing and implementing test plans with
our QA staff. You will manage multiple responsibilities which include
responding to operational requests from customers to modify or enhance
existing web-based applications, performing on-call duties for after hours
emergencies regarding operational systems and processes, modifying or
enhancing existing web-based perl applications in accordance with provided
feature specifications, and performing preventative maintenance on existing
applications and services. Your outgoing personality and proven Perl acumen
will elevate your candidacy for a much sought after spot on our close-knit
and -entrepreneurial team. This role is ideal for the Perl engineer who
loves working on a variety of projects rather than focusing on a single
project for months at a time. If you desire a challenge and appreciate
being recognized for your efforts, and enjoy being part of a winning team,
you owe it to yourself to explore this opportunity with a recognized leader
in the online marketing space.
