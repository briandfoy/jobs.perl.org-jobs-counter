Job title: The Future is Now! Perl Role in Malaysia

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: cyberjaya, Malaysia

Pay rate: Depending on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
When Hollywood imagines the cities of the future they=E2=80=99re either ste=
rile
places filled with hover cars and ivory spires or squalid stacks of
concrete, neon, and metal. If only they knew that the city of the future
exists now, in beautiful, action-packed Malaysia, they might see that the
city of the future is full of greenery, chic apartments, and mouth-watering
restaurants.

With a great location that is only a short drive from Kuala
Lumpur, Cyberjaya is the Silicon Valley of Asia. Developed as a science
park with a focus on technology, it=E2=80=99s no wonder that a pile of
international corporations have chosen Cyberjaya as their headquarters.
Amenities abound, including The Cyberjaya Lake Gardens, which is a nature
park that spans a whopping 400 acres. Who needs a hover car when you can go
for a wander in the trees? Other notable stops are the basketball and
tennis courts, swimming pool, driving range to practice your swing, and a
go-kart circuit when the need for speed strikes. Add in an incredible
variety of international and fusion restaurants and you=E2=80=99ll be livin=
g the
future now.

If you=E2=80=99re a Perl programmer with a passion for finance, this
role may be the one for you. Our client is a financial company whose
stunning growth over the last twenty years shows that they belong in the
city of the future. They=E2=80=99ve built a company with an international p=
resence
on that idea, and business is booming.

Living in the city of the future
provides all kinds of fun and excitement but sometimes, you may find
yourself wanting to get away. Exploring the rest of Asia from Cyberjaya
couldn=E2=80=99t be easier. You=E2=80=99re only a short drive from Air Asia=
=E2=80=99s home airport,
meaning that you=E2=80=99re connected to the rest of Asia for weekends away
whenever wanderlust sets in.

For those ready to trade their present-day
role for an exciting new opportunity in the city of the future, get on your
comms device (read: computer) and let us know that you=E2=80=99re ready for=
 what
comes next. Apply now!

Desired skills:
Looking for Perl developers with a strong background in Modern Perl =E2=80=
=93 you
should be comfortable with Moose and PSGI/Plack, and a solid grounding in
using Perl=E2=80=99s testing tools.
