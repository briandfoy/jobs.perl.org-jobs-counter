Job title:

Company name: iGuard / Quintiles

Location: United States, NJ, Princeton

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Description:
iGuard is a well funded startup currently in beta testing - with a wishlist
of function refinements and codebase tightening planned for the next 12
months.

We're looking for an expert Perl developer with proven skills in code
optimization, system tightening (for security and speed) and migrating
'single box' systems into a more distributed setup as load increases... And
ideally someone interested in being part of a small but dynamic team. 

We're in a highly iterative stage of development and need people who can
keep our systems honest, stable, maintainable and scalable - but at the
same time recognize a need to keep up with innovation... If you're up for
the challenge, we need you!


Required skills:
Guru Perl/Linux Code Administration
Expert level security (let's keep vulnerabilities closed)
Expert level experience with load balanced systems
Expert Perl/DBI, Mysql
Strong CVS, software design skills


Desired skills: Excellent communication skills
