Job title: HP017 Software Engineer

Company name: ADNET

Location: Greenbelt, MD, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
Programmer for the Solar Data Analysis Center at NASA"s Goddard Space
Flight Center.

The primary task is the Virtual Solar Observatory, a search
engine for solar physics data.	The VSO is primarily in Perl, with a lot of
SQL and a few bash scripts.  There are also some things that we interact in
Java & C, and clients in IDL, python & java.

Work would be on-site
initially for knowledge transfer, but as the other three programmers aren't
local, we do most of our communication through instant messaging, so if you
can show reliability, then teleworking can be arranged (assuming no changes
in NASA policies).

Desired skills:
*Must* be a US Citizen or permanent resident.  (and submit to a US
government background check)
Must have 3+ years of Perl experience
(preferably OO and not just 'I did some perl4 a decade ago')
Must have SQL
experience (preferably mysql and/or postgres)
Must have POSIX experience
(preferably MacOS X or Linux)
Should have a BS in Computer Science (but
years of experience may be better for this)

Desired Experience:

Perl
modules DBI, CGI and SOAP::Lite
programming languages plpgsql, IDL, python,
bash, javascript, java, C
knowledge of scientific data (especially the FITS
file format).

And it helps if you're interested in science.
