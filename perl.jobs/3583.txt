Job title:
Perl Developer for Financial company in Santa Monica, CA

Company name: TEKsystems

Location: United States, CA, Santa Monica

Pay rate: competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
TEKsystems' client, a fast-paced financial-industry company, is developing
a web-based reporting tool for their customers, and looking for a strong
PERL developer to join their team in Santa Monica. This company has a
worldwide presence, and applies academic research to the practical world of
investing.

Their clients currently have the ability to set up preferences on the web
so their monthly report is tailored to their individual needs. The
framework for these reports is already in place, so on a day to day basis
you would be developing the Object-Oriented Perl program that accesses the
MySQL database, pulling the information into an XML file. You will work
closely with the sales/marketing department who will define report
requirements and with a designer who will do the physical layout of the
report.

As the perfect candidate, you must have at least 3 years of strong
experience in Object-Oriented Perl, XSL, and MySQL. Also necessary is a
strong knowledge of Object Oriented PHP. Any experience with XSL-FO is a
definite plus.

This is a 3-month project for contractors on a W-2 basis, with a strong
possibility of extension.

Required skills:
Perl (procedural or object oriented), XSL, PHP, MySQL

Desired skills: XSL-FO
