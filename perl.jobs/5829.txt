Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C25

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
IntelliSurvey is the online market research technology leader. We are a
privately held company based in Southern California. We also have an office
in Lexington, KY, and remote staff in various other locations around the
country. The company is financially stable and profitable.

Our leading edge software includes tools for creating and managing complex
online surveys, real-time reports, and terabyte-scale data management. We
have a team of people that use our software internally in order to create
advanced web-based surveys, and we also license our product to select
clients via an ASP model. We seek to hire an outstanding Web Application
Developer to support our development efforts.

We are currently adding major new features to our software to allow us to
stay ahead of the competition. Our new hire(s) will have the opportunity to
play a significant role in the design and development of these new
features. The programming will be done using database-backed and
object-oriented Perl on the server, and using JavaScript and Ajax for the
front-end.

Depending on your background and experience, you may also be responsible
for helping to monitor and manage our servers, and for occasionally
providing technical support to our clients.


Required skills:
We'd prefer to hire someone with plenty of advanced Perl and JavaScript
experience. However, if you can write excellent* code in any language then
we'd like to hear from you. You will be expected to work independently,
show initiative, and have a professional manner with clients.

*excellent -- of highest quality; plus: easy to read and explain; easy to
extend; possible to debug; and timely.
