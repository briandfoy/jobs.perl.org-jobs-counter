Description:
MaxMind (www.maxmind.com) is looking for a talented and world-class System

transactions each year, and we provide IP intelligence data to thousands
more. This work requires us to tackle formidable challenges and we want you

of complex features, and to the success of MaxMind software products?

As a

Our System Administration Practices
Our
System Administrators are members of our Engineering team, working together
to deliver to our customers=E2=80=99 success. At MaxMind, we are committed =
to
security and the contributions of our System Administrators are integral to
our work. To learn more about our commitment to security, visit
https://www.maxmind.com/en/company/commitment-to-security. We have built a
culture of peers, with highly developed practices and processes to work
together remotely. To learn more about working at MaxMind, visit
https://www.maxmind.com/en/company/working-at-maxmind.=09

We use Linux,
PostgreSQL, and Ansible to deliver our solution.  We use a wide variety of
tools to manage and monitor our systems, including Nagios, Sensu, Grafana,
and the Elastic/ELK stack. All work goes through internal code review on
GitHub Enterprise.


Our goal is to automate as much as possible. Our tools
are written in Perl and Go. We also want to improve our coding practices
for the sysadmin code we write, writing libraries and tests wherever
possible instead of one-off scripts.



Working at MaxMind
MaxMind is a
casual, friendly, results-focused company of 40+ employees.  We are
passionate about global health and development, as MaxMind and its founder
gladly donate over 60% of corporate profits to charities
(https://www.maxmind.com/en/corporate-giving).	We maintain a set of core,
overlapping hours, but are flexible with specific start and end times and
are understanding about appointments and life events. Our software team is
largely comprised of telecommuters, so communication centers around video
calls, group chat, and agile planning tools.


Our salary range begins at
$100,000 for Engineering hires and is negotiable depending on experience.
Everyone participates in a company performance-based bonus plan. MaxMind
offers a $2,000 professional development budget and five days for
professional development annually.
In addition to medical, dental, and
vision coverage, we offer several other benefits in the US, including a
401k with employer contribution, Health Savings Account, Limited Purpose
Flexible Spending Account, paid parental leave, and a public transit
reimbursement. Please inquire about benefits in Canada.


Diversity and
Inclusion
We're committed to diversity and inclusion and are mindful of
incorporating them into all aspects of our company. New ideas and
perspectives come from diverse ways of seeing and thinking. MaxMind is
sensitive to all individuals and viewpoints and believes everyone=E2=80=99s
contributions and opinions are valuable assets to our team.

We hold
regular diversity and inclusion meetings and conduct informative sessions
on improving collaboration and communication. We value bringing individuals
and different perspectives together within and across every department.

We
encourage and sincerely welcome applications from candidates of color,
women, queer candidates, candidates with family caregiving
responsibilities, transgender candidates, and from other communities not
well represented in the tech world.

If you have suggestions on how we may
better promote or express our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we
would love to hear from you. Please send your suggestions to
hr@maxmind.com.
