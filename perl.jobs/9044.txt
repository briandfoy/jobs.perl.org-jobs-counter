Web Application Senior Software Engineer 
Location: Boston, MA 
Company: Pearson ' www.pearson.com 
Products: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry, MasteringAstronomy,
MasteringBiology 


POSITION SUMMARY: 
Technology is transforming the way we educate students. Pearson understands
this fact, and it is committed to playing a leadership role in the
transformation. The software development group you would be joining,
referred to internally at Pearson as the 'Mastering' team, is responsible
for an online homework / tutoring system for college science students. The
specific products are called: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry,
MasteringAstronomy, and MasteringBiology. We are extremely proud of these
products ' they are based on educational research done at M.I.T. and they
have proven very effective. 

The Mastering product line is currently built on top of standard web
technology: Perl, Flash, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, MySQL, and Apache. It is a
high-throughput database application that services hundreds of thousands of
students. 

We are looking for a senior web developer to help with both design and
implementation. We are expecting continued rapid growth in usage of the
platform as well as continued demands for new functionality. To satisfy
these demands we will need to continually refactor the application as well
as build entirely new subsystems. 

We are most interested in raw intelligence, deep web application
experience, and a go-anywhere, do-anything attitude. We are looking for
someone who is happiest when the entire codebase is his/her playground.
That said, right now we are particularly interested in candidates with
expertise in User Interaction / User Experience technology. We are just
starting to plan out significant UI/UX changes, and we need someone with
experience in web UI/UX technologies to interact with out our existing
UI/UX product management and design folks. 

The office is on Arlington Street at the corner of the Boston Public
Garden. The environment is professional, but relaxed and flexible. The
emphasis is on getting good work done effectively rather than on adhering
to someone's idea of perfect process. It is a small development team. You
can have a major impact on the team dynamics and the product's evolution.

websites for each product:

' Good communication skills ' ability to work effectively with product
management and UI/UX designers 
' Perl (or equivalent) expertise 
' Software Engineering Background 
' Smart, Dedicated, Team Player 
' Comfortable working on a large (but organized) software project 
' Experience with multi-tier, high-throughput web applications 
' Database programming experience, working knowledge of SQL 

' Science, Engineering, and/or Math background is a plus 
' Educational / Teaching background is a plus
