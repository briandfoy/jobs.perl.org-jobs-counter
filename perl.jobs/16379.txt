Job title: Experienced Perl Web Developer - Fully Remote

Company name: RealtyNinja

Location: Vancouver, Canada

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
RealtyNinja is a SaaS system that provides awesome websites for busy
Canadian real estate agents. We are amongst the top such providers in the
country and our focus is to provide realtors with everything they need to
create beautiful, lead-generating sites that are easy to use and require
very little technical knowledge on their part.

We are a 100% remote team
of ninjas spread out across the globe. We use a mix of Basecamp, Slack,
Zoom and Helpscout to communicate and work hard so that we can focus on
living life to the fullest.

*  We're looking to fill a full-time remote
Perl developer position .
*  You must have years of experience as a modern
Perl web developer and be familiar with Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Moose and
other such modern Perl technologies.
*  We also have a lot of Javascript in
our app, so it's important to have experience with vanilla JS as well as
jQuery and other such related technologies.
*  Because we build websites,
in-depth knowledge of CSS and HTML is required.
*  Because we are a 100%
remote team, you need to be self-driven and able to work on your own, as
well as in a team.
*  You don't have to be a native English speaker but you
must be comfortable communicating daily with the team in both spoken and
written english, as this is the language we run our business in.
*  A paid
coding test project will be required to ensure you have the skills
necessary for us to hire you full time.

You=E2=80=99ll be a critical member of a
small engineering team working on every aspect of our application, from our
backend listing systems, to our front-end editor based CMS and various
internal tools, to keep our business running smoothly. This isn=E2=80=99t an
average position where you might be restricted to one small piece of the
company=E2=80=99s technology, but one where you=E2=80=99ll have influence o=
ver our entire
stack.

The position involves the following responsibilities:

*=20
Contribute to our front and backend systems built with Perl (Catalyst Web
Framework), Javascript (jQuery) and MySQL.
*  Help improve code quality
through writing unit tests, automation, bug fixing and performing code
reviews.
*  Participate in brainstorming sessions and have the chance to
contribute innovative and original ideas to our technology and product as a
whole.
*  Work with the product and design team to understand end-user
requirements and use cases, then translate that into pragmatic and
effective technical solutions.
*  Dive into difficult problems and
successfully deliver results.

On top of solid Perl, Javascript and Web
experience, the following points would be a bonus for us:

*  Vagrant
experience.
*  SysAdmin experience with Linux environments.
*  Git
experience.
*  Experience using Basecamp or other such project management
systems.
*  Open Source project work.
*  Bootstrap experience.

Some notes
about us:

*  We are currently a team of 13 and consider everyone to be
family.
*  We believe that you should work to live and not live to work.
*=20
We offer a very flexible vacation policy based on respect and trust.
*=20
Other than ensuring a reasonable amount of timezone overlap (PST) you have
the freedom to make your own schedule.

How to apply:

*  Write a brief
personal intro or record a short video (bonus points!) on why you want to
work with us and share any relevant CV, github, portfolio, sample projects.
Also state your monthly salary expectations for a full-time role (a range
is fine). Send the above to casimir@realtyninja.com with the keyword
"Shokunin" in the subject.
*  Once we review this, we will get you to fill
out a questionnaire to provide us with the info we need to move to the next
steps which include a video interview and a fully paid test project.

Desired skills:
* Perl
* Modern Perl Technologies (Catalyst, Moose, DBIx::Class, etc)
*
Javascript (jQuery)
* MySQL
* nginx
* Unit testing
* git
* Nunchaku skills
