Job title: Web/Perl Software Engineer

Company name: Topix

Location: Santa Clara, CA, Palo Alto

Pay rate: Competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Full Time

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
What's it like to work in Engineering at Topix?
We enjoy the best of both worlds. With backing from the three largest
newspaper companies in the US, we have the relationships and the
opportunities of a media giant. But we get to decide on our course. We're
independent and small enough to nimbly pursue bold new ideas without the
weight and politics of a media empire on us.
The world's changing every day, and you're working at the intersection of
media and technology. As part of a small and talented team, you'll have the
opportunity to make big contributions to the design and implementation of
new features and systems. But at the same time, you'll have the support
from an existing team and an infrastructure that has been in production for
years.

Are you one of us?
You live and breathe software and the Internet. CPAN and Slashdot are only
a click away in your bookmarks toolbar, and improving code performance,
reliability and maintainability intrigues you. Work and Fun aren't mutually
exclusive. You push yourself to deliver your best, but you're also
easygoing enough to roll with the punches. Releasing new software to the
world pumps you up, and you don't think twice about double checking and
testing before a push. But you're also up for hanging out with the crew and
eating pizza on the couch. 


Required skills:
Web/Perl Software Engineer
4+ years of commercial programming experience that is recently web focused;
strong programming skills in Perl, and knowledgeable with Linux and Apache;
great design skills and a practice of thoroughly testing code before
release. We're working on solving interesting and challenging problems
related to crawling, geo-localization and subject categorization of the
news. Named entity disambiguation. About-vs-mention discrimination. Heat
and tone language detection. Zero-configuration scalable crawling. All
in-memory index serving. On-the-fly category merging, clustering,
de-duplication, and geo-spinning. Anti spam. Auto-kickstart servers.
Reporting and tracking. 

We need You to help our users by improving our forums, news, classified and
other pages. We have multiple positions open at various levels of
experience. Though we don't expect you to have expertise in solving these
kinds of problems, we encourage you to come talk to us if they sound
interesting.
