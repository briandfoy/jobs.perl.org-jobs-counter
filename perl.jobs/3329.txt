Job title: Perl module developer, contract

Company name: (Confidential)

Internal ID: PC1

Location: United States, CA, San Diego

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Numerous small projects

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We have a need for skilled and experienced Perl developers to help us code
the Next Big Thing, in handy bite-size chunks. We give you some specs and a
data interface (parameters/returns), you give us a function or module that
fits.

The code needs to be modular, strict- and warnings-enabled, and must play
nice with mod_perl. It should also be as fast, efficient, and maintainable
as possible.  It's okay to golf, but not to obfuscate!

Your pay works as follows:  You specify your hourly rate, then we describe
what we need done. We negotiate and come up with the number of hours that
the project should take. Your pay is then your rate times the number of
hours estimated.

Onsite work is a bonus, but we're accepting telecommuters as well - as long
as you're good!

Required skills:
* Perl (of course)
* mod_perl
* DBI
* Good attitude/sense of humor

Desired skills:
* OOP
* Oracle
* CGI::Builder or other development framework
* Solaris
* Apache
* knowledge of Damian Conway's Perl Best Practices
* a PerlMonks.org account is a plus! Provide username
