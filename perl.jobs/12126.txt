that leverage and scale the firm’s banking and capital-markets franchise. 
•	Design, develop, and maintain software that centralizes
corporate-finance models from public and proprietary sources in SecDB. 
•	Apply best practices in software architecture, design, coding,
review, testing, debugging, and lifecycle management. 
•	Collaborate with a wide group of people, including IBD bankers and
marketers; the SecDB Core Strategies team that builds the SecDB
infrastructure; other members of IBD Strategies who build and change
pricing models; and technology and QA professionals.  

 Preferred Qualifications  
•	Has a strong academic grounding in, as well as 2+ years of industry
experience with, all aspects of good software architecture and design.
