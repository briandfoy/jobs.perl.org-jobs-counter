Job title: Experienced Perl Developer

Company name: Pelican Parts

Location: Los Angeles, CA, United States

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We currently need to fill a Perl Developer role to join our talented team. 
We are looking for someone exceptional and self-motivated, and someone who
is energized and readily embraces a challenge.	Our environment here is
fast-paced but casual.	You will have the opportunity to grow with us while
helping us improve our ecommerce site, various content sites, enhance our
existing tools and help us to build new ones.

Candidates with senior level
development experience are preferred. SQL experience is also necessary and
JavaScript experience is a big plus.  The kind of individual we seek should
have clear knowledge of developing web-based tools and apps as well as
creating automation software, system tools, and a solid understanding of
data processing and report generation.

Desired skills:
Minimum Requirements:

* Must have at least 5+ years of direct hands-on
Perl development experience.  Ability to work with existing/legacy code,
work with others on team projects as well as occasionally being the sole
developer on smaller projects.

* Must have 3+ years of experience with
SQL, including Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL.	Your SQL experience must
include forming your own queries, understanding query efficiency, query
performance evaluation and how to maintain an optimized balance of database
logic and programming code.

* We are a Windows environment, you must have
experience and comfort with that.

* Ability & understanding of how to to
thoroughly unit-test your work on your own.

* Excellent communication
skills.

Preferred experience:

* Experience with JavaScript is a big plus,
including frameworks (jQuery in particular).  JavaScript knowledge for
developing on-page interactivity, DOM manipulation, AJAX, and use of JSON
is the type that we would be looking for.  Although we are not looking for
a dedicated front-end developer in this role, candidates with solid working
experience in this area will increase our interest.

* Additional
experience with other server-side scripting languages (PHP, Powershell,
Python) is a plus.

* If your Perl experience includes frameworks such as
Catalyst, Dancer or Mojolicious this would be beneficial to us going into
the future.  Familiarity with object-oriented frameworks such as Moose as
well as template modules or toolkits are not critical but also a plus for
our future needs.

* A background working with ecommerce sites, B2C and
customer support sites is very helpful.

Since we are growing and likely to
expand our technology base, a developer with full stack experience for
end-to-end web development would be of greatest interest to us.  Our most
immediate projects to tackle include:

* Program enhancements or entirely
new features to our proprietary back-end inventory system (called “OBOE”)
from a list of specifications supplied by our internal stakeholders.

*
Address issues with OBOE and our customer support & ticketing system used
by our CSRs
* Creation of test plans and data validation reports for
catalog builds, as needed
* Assist with normalizing our code base to make
use of centralized common libraries
* Assist in ensuring our order
processing code base remains PCI-compliant as we add and extend features
*
Enhance dynamic site features – Shopping Cart, Search Engine, Product Info
Pages, Product Wizards
* Creation of content processing routines to
normalize our publishing of article-based content
* Work with front-end
teams and Marketing to implement SEO optimizations across our various web
site properties
* Handling a constant flow of data processing and
integration tasks
