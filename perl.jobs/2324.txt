Description:

Application Description: Applications are the Test Information Management

and post the results (pass,fail,pending) to a repository.

Business Objective: (Why do you have this need?) Client needs this
individual to be able to help with the sporadic conversion of Cisco groups
from the old tool to the new tool. This will absolutely be the main aspect
of their job, but between conversion efforts, they want to be able to
leverage either Java or Oracle DBA experience...this is the reason that
they are asking for either Java or Oracle as a secondary skill.

Position: Dev/Maint Prog. Analyst(Web) - XML Number of Openings: 1
Job Description: (Day to day duties)Migration of clients from older,
internally written application to newer version. Application consists of
automated migration tool written in Perl that calls modules to export data
to XML, run through an XSLT translator, and import into new DB. Migrations
clients may have specific requirements that require the modification of the
exportation/importation modules, translation, and Perl script.
"Must Haves"
Technical skills essential for this assignment: (Prioritize importance most
to least) Engineer will need to understand both of the existing
applications, the migration tool, XML APIs, client requirements and engage
w/ clients and mgmt team to ensure a successful migration.

Pluses: Java development background OR Oracle DBA background. Although the
Java and Oracle experience has nothing to do with the data conversion
project, they need this individual to have on these bonus skills so that
they can help with other work in between conversions.


Required skills: Perl, XML, XSLT, SQL

Desired skills: Java or Oracle DBA experience
