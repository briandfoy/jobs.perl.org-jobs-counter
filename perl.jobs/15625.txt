Description:
The software distribution engineering team is looking for a strong Perl

team using DevOps practices and methodologies.

The team sits within the
larger unix engineering group who are responsible for designing and
implementing Linux infrastructure for distributed systems. The group is
involved in evaluation, certification, integration, and maintenance of
numerous products, including hardware, Operating Systems (Red Hat Linux and
Solaris), system configuration, system services (DNS, DHCP, NTP, etc.),
filesystems (AFS, NFS and various cluster filesystems), virtualization
technologies and a variety of in-house developed tools.
