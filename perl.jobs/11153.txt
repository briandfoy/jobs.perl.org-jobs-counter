Job title:
Technical Manager for StartUp (development, sysadmin, general tech guru) -
The Yacht Week

Company name: The Yacht Week

Location: United Kingdom, SW6 3HH, London

Pay rate: 2000+

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are looking for a programmer with the skills and initiative to continue
developing the technical platform that handles our bookings, in order to
maintain our position as the most technically advanced companyin the
yachting business.

Key is passion and increasing engagement! We may start with 50% but go for
full time within 6-12 months. If you can relocate to London that is a plus,
if you like sailing and adventure, that is also good. We do NOT consider
offshore applicants and Telecommute Only Candidates

The platform we have today handles the administration of bookings and
payments, and syncs yacht availability with our partners. Bookings are made
directly on our site, and customer can log in to their accounts to
administrate their crew list, order transfer and check payment status. For
an added social experience, bookings and crew lists can be connected to the
Facebook accounts of our customers. The entire platform is written in Perl
with data stored in a MySQL database. It has been in use and continuously
developed since The Yacht Week started. During a transition period, part of
your job will be to maintain and improve this system with additional
features.

In the near future we are planning to develop a completely new system,
based on our current experience and adapted for our business as it looks
today. This will be your big project. As lead developer your job will be to
plan and implement the development of our new platform. Our CTO, who has
developed our current system, will assist and supervise you in this. We are
planning to outsource part of the programming in this project, and you will
be in charge of the outsourcing.

Required skills:
Experience of developing efficient and well-structured web applications.
Fluency in MySQL.
Having worked with creating nice-looking online user interfaces, preferably
in AJAX, otherwise in HTML/CSS.
Perl experience would be very nice, PHP experience no too bad either. But
really, if you’re the programmer we’re looking for you’ll learn any of
those languages in a week anyway.


Desired skills:
Value opportunity to travel with the team on site during summer
Entrepreneurial Spirit
Desire to increase involvment over time
