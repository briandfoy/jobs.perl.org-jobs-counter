Job title: web programmer for micro-ISV

Company name: Hutchinson Software Pty Ltd

Location: Australia, NSW, Armidale

Pay rate: $NEG

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hutchinson Software has been building perl web applications since the last
century. Due to continuing growth we're looking for someone to assist
full-time with development of our existing and new projects.

We develop and maintain web applications for our clients, and for our own
in-house projects.

Our projects are mainly web based, primarily Perl, with some PHP and
C#/ASP.NET, and a few PC desktop applications for variety.

The job requires someone who is enthusiastic about their coding, and
willing to take on the challenge of getting up to speed on some fairly
sophisticated software and learn new skills as required for our projects.
Frequently you will be working independently from a minimal (agile)
specification and will be driving feature development from design through
to implementation.


Required skills:
Experience in Perl-based web applications is a requirement, ideally on
HTML::Mason or Catalyst using object-orientated perl. You must be familiar
with the DBI, and complex SQL should hold no fears.

We follow best-practises where possible, with test-directed development and
version control, and experience with these processes is required.

You must be based in Australia/NZ so we don't need to juggle timezones.

The bulk of the work will require ssh to our linux development server. A
windows environment is necessary to work on some of our projects.
