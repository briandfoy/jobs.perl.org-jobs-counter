Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: 2 Years

Hours: Full time

Description:
Lokku Limited (proud owners of www.nestoria.co.uk) are now recruiting a
perl programmer.  This is very much a startup environment (7 employees, 4
engineers, one room) where employees are expected to wear several
fashionable hats and contribute to decisions across the business.

General experience with OO perl and internet development is more important
than specific exposure to a set of acronyms or libraries, but time spent
with LAMP, AJAX, and Mason are definite bonuses for this particular role. 
We are looking for a full time hire to work out of our offices in Covent
Garden.  No contractors or telecommuters, please.

See URL for complete job spec.

Required skills: OO perl

Desired skills:
Mason
AJAX
