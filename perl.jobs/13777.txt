Job title:
Admin site front end with Perl back end to work with Jaspersoft server

Company name: Silverfox

Location: Ca

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I had a trusted perl developer who I have been working with for some years
retire so Im looking for great perl developer who is looking to make some
money on the side or add a new customer to their list of clients. I need
about 10-15 hours of perl work a month.  Here is my current project that Im
looking to find someone to help me with:

So I have jaspersoft setup on a Linux box and Id like to be able to have
our customer’s daily product pricing data (all flat files) live inside
jaspersoft in their own versions of the jaspersoft. More on jaspersoft here
(http://www.jaspersoft.com/) I’m looking to automate some of the setup with
an admin site.	The admin site can be built in php/html/wordpress but back
end to perform actions should be written in Perl. The admin site would
allow an admin to do the following:

  
1.	The ability to log into the admin site. So there would be a
username and password prompt. Once inside I would have the ability to
manage all the accounts. So there would be a 3 web pages (account creation,
list accounts, edit account page.) these would serve to enter account
details and modify them. 

2.	 Account creation page. This page would have the ability to create
new accounts. So there would be a prompt for account name, prompt for
password, prompt for email address of user, email and passwords for 20
other users, prompt for location of flat files, time when flat files should
be imported into MYSQL and finally a create account button. In the
background when the create account button is clicked the following happens
via Perl:

a.	I think it would create a stand-alone MYSQL db for each user and
also stand alone version of jaspersoft. That way nobody’s data gets mixed
with anybody else’s data.
b.	So I would also like the ability to automate an import from the
data from the flat files pulled into the customers MYSQL db. Right now we
have alot of flat csv files, I would like these csv files to be added to
the MySQL db for each of the accounts. So upon creating an account a cron
job would also be generated that would at the time set up on the customers
account to each day import todays file into MySQL and date stamp the import
inside MYSQL. These would not be too hard to setup. * MYSQL supports etl
directly e.g:
LOAD DATA INFILE 'path/to/file.csv' INTO TABLE your_table FIELDS TERMINATED
BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' SET id=null;

3.	The list accounts page would just list all the accounts by account
name. Clicking on the account name would bring you to the edit account
page. 

4.	The edit account page would give you the ability to edit (username,
password, email address) of the users and also delete accounts all
together. Deleting an account would remove the database as well as their
instance of jaspersoft from the box. 

  If you could email me back if your interested in this project with a bid.
 I would like to start this project this week, if possible. Thanks for your
time reading this.

Desired skills: Jaspersoft experience
