Job title: e-commerce Programmer

Company name: Logitech/SLim Devices

Internal ID: SECURE-DEV

Location: United States, CA, San Jose

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
We are looking for an experienced Perl programmer to make significant
changes to our existing e-comm engine.	This is a contractor position, but
as our core codebase for SlimServer and SqueezeNetwork is Perl-based, there
is a good possibility that the role could grow into a full-time position.

Most of the changes required involve moving fixed data to a SQL database,
along with enhancements to the UI on both the customer-facing and
administrative sides.

Required skills:
Mad skills in Unix/Linux, Perl, SQL, xHTML, CSS (Type 1 and 2).

Desired skills:
Be somewhat clueful of connecting e-commerce engines to the rest of the
world (credit card processing, shipping, etc).	We use UPS Brown, so it
would be great if you have worked with it before but it isn't required.
