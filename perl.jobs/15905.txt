training run by the very capable and experienced senior developers.

The
ideal candidate has a lot of experience with Modern Perl, strong but
flexible opinions on the right way to approach a range of common Perl and
architectural challenges, and an interest in challenging and growing more
junior coworkers. It’s a Senior Perl Developer role, with a particular
focus on mentoring.
