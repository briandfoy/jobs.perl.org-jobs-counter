Leading provider of local online marketing solutions seeking talented Perl
software engineer with an interest in web services.

ReachLocal, Inc. is looking for a motivated Software Engineer (SE) to join
its growing software development team. Day to day activities will include
developing, maintaining, testing, supporting, and documenting our external
partner integration software. This software communicates with the APIs of
Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and others and executes hundreds of thousands of
commands every day against those APIs. 

With direction from a team lead, the SE will be involved in requirements
gathering, design, implementation, bug fixing, and code refactoring. The SE
will also help ensure the system can efficiently scale as Reachlocal grows,
and will work closely with our Quality Assurance team to ensure the
correctness and robustness of the software. 

The ideal candidate must work well in teams and on an individual basis,
enjoy automating tasks that would take humans a prohibitive amount of time,
and be interested in taking our software to the next level. This talented
developer should be skilled at balancing priorities and will need to keep
up with the new features our publishers make available to us while working
in an unstructured, fast-paced, start-up environment.

Does this sound like you? If so, know that ReachLocal offers a challenging
work environment with opportunities to learn new technologies and grow as a
developer, as well as a competitive salary and full benefits including a
401(k) plan and stock options.
