Job title:
Perl Developer, London - assist with/take over maintenance of existing
project

Company name: Hansford Associates

Location: United Kingdom, London, London

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
I'm looking for a freelance perl developer to assist with and potentially
take over an existing project for that legendary "large media company in
west London".

The system is based on TT, DBIC/DBI, much XML and CSV parsing of
occasionally shonky data coming via API or file download. Version control
is SVN. Task and time tracking through JIRA. There is a fair degree of
battling with release management and pushing changes through the syste to
live.

The user-facing system is PHP with CSS and jQuery, and the backend is
Java/Spring/Hibernate/mvn so familiarity with either of these is useful.

This will be mostly remote working although working with me in NW1 will be
often useful. Meetings in W1 and W12 are also likely occasionally.

There is the strong possibility that in the coming months this project will
spring back to life in interesting ways.

CVs to david.hodgkinson@hansfordassociates.com

Required skills: DBI, DBIx::Class, XML, LWP.

Desired skills: Use of RESTful API's
