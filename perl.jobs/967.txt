Job title:
Perl CGI/DBI programmer to complete project

Company name: inSite Internet Solutions

Location: United States, IL, Woodstock

Pay rate: negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: TBD

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
Mailing list manager and article archival system that I started needs to be
carried through to completion by someone faster and more knowledgeable. The
three pieces holding up the finalization project are a search interface, a
keyword tracking utility, and building scheduling into the MIME::Lite-based
mail utility. I can get into more detail but prefer to do this on the phone
(URLs will be provided). There is $$$ budgeted for this but I need a
project quote from you after reviewing the project parameters with me.

Required skills:
Perl 5.005_03+, DBI, MySQL, CGI.pm, CGI::Session, cron, MIME::Lite, *NIX

Desired skills:
Significant experience with Perl, DBI, and CGI. Preferably a background
with at least a few similar projects under your belt.
