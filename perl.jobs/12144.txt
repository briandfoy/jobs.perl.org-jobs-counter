Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Liquid Web Inc.

Location: Lansing, MI, USA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for talented developers to join our growing team and to
deliver quality software. We have a focus on modern best practices such as
automated testing, rapid releases, distributed version control, and
object-oriented code. The growing need for automated deployment in the
hosting industry means we get to interact with burgeoning technologies like
virtualization, distributed systems, and automated network configuration.
We're looking for more smart people to help us build out our Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS) offerings and customer portals, as well as maintain and
modernize our existing internal applications.

We leverage open source technologies (Perl, PostgreSQL, CPAN, CentOS) and
are working towards a culture of contributing back to the community. Liquid
Web still maintains a lot of its startup roots, so self-starters with a
get-it-done attitude thrive. We want people who strive to push things
forward on the team and who aren't afraid to tackle a project head-on
without a lot of hand-holding. The ability to juggle multiple projects
simultaneously and prioritize them effectively is a must.

Required skills:
We have need for developers at all experience levels and with various skill
sets. Our ideal applicant would have many of these skills:

* Solid development fundamentals with a good understanding of
object-oriented programming
* Thorough experience in Perl or a proven track record of strong
development in other languages with the ability to quickly learn and
embrace Perl.
* Confidence with distributed version control systems (We use git)
* Experience with unit testing and a recognition of the immense value it
provides
* Familiarity with CPAN and the plethora of quality packages it provides.
(We use HTML::Mason, DateTime, Log::Log4perl, DBIx::Class, Test::Class,
Devel::NYTProf and much more)
* In-depth understanding of LAMP or similar application stacks
* Experience with optimizing code through profiling
* Understanding of Unix/Linux fundamentals and system administration
* Experience with virtualization (Xen, KVM, LXC, etc)
* Knowledge of networking, sockets, filesystems, etc
* Experience utilizing high performance relational databases (experience
with NoSQL systems is a plus!)
* Web centric user interface design (HTML, CSS)
* Understanding of JavaScript and JS frameworks (Events, Closures, AJAX,
jQuery)

Whether you are a specialist working on network code, or a generalist
reaching across various skill sets, as long as you are willing to learn, we
want to hear from you.
