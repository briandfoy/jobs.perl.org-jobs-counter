Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: MaxMind

Location: Waltham, MA  USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
As a Senior Software Engineer, your job will be to carry out development
projects both big and small. You may work on data collection improvements
for our fraud system, fixing bug in our open source APIs, or developing an
entirely new service. We're looking for an experienced software developer
who can make good technical design decisions, write tests and
documentation, and communicate with non-developers.

About MaxMind
We're a small, privately held company of about 25 employees and founded in
2002. As an employee of MaxMind, you'll enjoy the flexibility and autonomy
that come with being a member of a small technical team. We're a casual,
friendly, results-focused company. We want you to get things done, but it's
also important to have a life outside the office.

Transaction fraud detection is a constantly changing field, and our work is
never done. Fraudsters are always looking for new ways to evade detection,
which means we're always looking for new ways to detect them. Our fraud
detection service, minFraud, builds on top of our widely used GeoIP
products, which associate geographical and other data with individual IP
addresses. We screen half a billion online transactions each year and
provide IP intelligence data to thousands of companies worldwide.

Our office is located near downtown Waltham, MA, outside of Boston, five
minute walk from the nearest commuter rail line and several express bus
lines.

Massachusetts residents may have the option of telecommuting. Our
development team is largely comprised of telecommuters, so communication
centers around Google Hangouts, group chat, and agile planning tools.

In addition to great medical, dental and vision coverage, we offer several
other benefits.  Additional benefits include 401k with employer
contribution, FSA, annual performance bonuses and transit reimbursement.

Required skills:
•	Dynamic language programming experience. We use Perl but we're
happy to hear from Javascript, PHP, Python, or Ruby developers as well.
•	Web development, especially RESTful web services.
•	Experience developing for deployment on a Linux or BSD platform.
•	Experience writing tests and documentation.
•	Experience doing code reviews.
•	Excellent written and spoken communication skills.
•	The ability to work with a geographically dispersed team.

Desired skills:
•	Data mining, number crunching, and math skills.
•	Experience writing C, especially libraries.
•	Experience writing Go.
•	FS/OSS contributions. Tell us about them!
