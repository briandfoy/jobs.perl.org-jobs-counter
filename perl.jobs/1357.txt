Job title:
Bank Branch Support & Perl Development in Toronto

Company name: PerlUSA

Internal ID: Toronto

Location: Canada, Ontario, Mississauga

Pay rate: USD $40-50K per year

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Approx. 5 years

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're a growing company of Perl programmers, based in San Francisco and
Sacramento, California.  We cover the usual "LAMP" components (Linux,
Apache, MySQL, Perl), as well as some other areas, but our deepest
expertise is Perl, mod_perl, Mason, and the like.

One of our clients needs 5 people to provide operations support, heavy Perl
and shell scripting development, and QA functions.  These positions are
*not* pure development; instead, they revolve around operations and
customer support.  The technical/development side of these jobs is
certainly important and necessary, but not more than 50% of what our client
is seeking.  Our client has rejected some applicants who were technically
great, but who lacked solid human/social/communication skills.

We're really looking for people with a positive and gregarious attitude. 
Experience in operations support, sysadmin, or technical customer service
is a good thing.  You should be bright, happy, intelligent, and able to
interact with other people very well in person and via the telephone. 
Telephone skills are paramount, since much of the job is telephone-based. 
You should be fun and knowledgeable on the phone, and you should possess
native knowledge of English, Canadian culture, and possibly French.  Our
client is looking for Canadian citizens.

The client is a financial services company, and they estimate these jobs
will last for five years (of course, there are no guarantees).	Pay is
moderate for the Perl developer market, but appropriate given the focus on
support/service instead of pure, advanced Perl development.

Required skills:
    * Great service/support orientation.
      Concern for helping co-workers and customers solve problems as
      they arise.  Maintain positive and friendly attitude throughout.

    * Great social skills.
      Able to converse with others about various topics, share ideas,
      debate issues; work within a dynamic group; talk about politics
      or business, as much as technology.

    * Great communication skills.
      Able to read, write, and speak English well, maybe also French.
      Native knowledge of Canadian culture.  U.S. culture also helpful.

    * Good business/economic sense.
      Understanding of general business and economic concepts.

    * Solid Perl experience.
      Continuous, commercial Perl experience for at least four years.
      You should be able to demonstrate that Perl is the language you
      use more than any other language for the past four years.

    * Solid Unix experience.
      Continuous, commercial experience doing development on
      Unix/Linux for at least four years.  This means light (or better)
      system administration experience, as well as solid shell scripting
      experience.  Overall, you should be totally comfortable developing
      on Unix/Linux platforms.

    * Solid RDBMS experience.
      Extensive, commercial experience using SQL databases.  Prefer
      Sybase.  Oracle and DB2 are nice to have.

    * QA or software test experience.
      Moderate experience developing test plans, test scripts, and test
      cases.

    * Experience with Perl-related technologies on Unix/Linx.
      (DBI, LWP, mod_perl, Mason, etc).

    * Experience with other technologies on Unix/Linux.
      (Apache, Sendmail, C/C++, etc).

    * Familiarity with formal development process, including version
      control.	Very cool if you already have experience with CVS or
      similar.

    * College education.  Minimum 4-year degree.  A focus on computer
      science, mathematics, or a related area is good, but not required.

Desired skills:
    * Java and/or C++ experience.
      Solid Java and/or C++ experience (3+ years) is a real plus.

    * Financial instruments and products.
      Familiarity with financial instruments and products is a plus.

    * Peregrine/Falcon, Expect, Autosys.
      Familiarity with Peregrine/Falcon, Expect, and Autosys is a plus.

    * Proven desire to keep learning, preferably from early life,
      following through with recent developments today.
