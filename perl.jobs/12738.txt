Job title: Software Engineer- Front Office

Company name: Zappos IP inc.

Location: Las Vegas, NV, USA

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hello future Zappos Software Engineer! Look down at your resume. Now back
to this job description. Now back to your resume. Now think about your
current job. Sadly, your job doesn’t sound like this job, and it’s not
Zappos IP, Inc. But if you apply for this job, it could be.
 
Look down. Now back up. Where are you? Your team doesn’t build, integrate
and maintain all the systems to support a 1600-person company including the
website, warehouse management, order management, and customer service
systems? Well we do. We can do this because along with our ability to speak
in a commanding and suave manner, each person on our team has the power to
make things happen.  Now look down again, you’re not on a boat but you are
sitting in a chair when you could be on a plane flying to your interview at
Zappos for the job your job could be.

Experience and skills needed to do that thing you love at Zappos:

Experience with multiple programming languages: Perl, Java, Ruby, Python,
C/C++ are preferred. 
Understanding of PSGI and experience with Plack 
Experience with Mojolicious is a plus! 
3-5 years experience programming in an open source environment. 
BS in Computer Science or Engineering (or equivalent combination of
education and experience). 
Have either a most or least-favorite web framework (bonus points if you
have written your own MVC framework). 
Ability to perform a SQL minus operation without using a sub-select. 
Ability to understand the above bullet point. 
Experience with large-scale ERP or eCommerce systems. 
Experience developing apps with the Zappos API (Just kidding. No, but
seriously http://developer.zappos.com). 
Have at least 3 unfinished personal projects scattered around the
Internets. 
Experience with high-volume transactional systems
grep –i ‘linux’ yourresume.doc | wc –l > 0. 
Can picture yourself writing algorithms while horseback riding in white
linen pants with a button-down tied around your neck. 
Anything is possible when you work with Zappos IP, Inc. If you love
building complex enterprise systems and want the fun and feel of a start-up
company, but the solid management and resources of an established business,
we are the place for you. 
 
Relocation is available to qualified candidates!
 
Need more reasons to consider us? In January 2012, Zappos.com, Inc. and its
subsidiaries were named #11 on the 2012 Fortune: 100 Best Companies to Work
For List. Why else? We offer an extensive benefits package for all
full-time employees, including medical, dental, vision, and 401k! And…
we’re hiring like crazy right now, and looking for smart, forward-thinking
problem solvers to join our world-class, and fairly wacky team.
 
Zappos IP, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer and drug free workplace.
