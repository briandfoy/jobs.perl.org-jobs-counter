Subject: Seeking Perl Work - Portland Oregon/telecommute.
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: cmoore@vetinari.hellyeah.org (Clint Moore)


        Greetings.  My name is Clint Moore and I am currently looking for
a perl programming position.  Over the past year or so I have been
involved in private research pertaining to search engine mechanics and
crawlers.  The majority of this work has been writing maintenance and
interface scripts using DBI, HTML::Parser, HTML::Mason, and assorted other
modules.  My primary personal programming intrests are parallel processing
and transaction processing between clusters and databases.  This includes
working with Parallel::PVM and some modules of my own.  My total perl
experience is about a year and a half of professional work.

        I am open to full time or part time work and telecommuting is not
a problem either as I have a full time connection at home.

        In addition to this I have roughly 8 years of experience as a
Solaris systems administrator.  So I can potentially fill two roles at
once though my first love is programming.  You can view my resume at

Please let me know if you have any questions.
