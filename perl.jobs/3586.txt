Job title: mod_perl/C developer

Company name: OmniTI

Internal ID: uk-perl-dev

Location: United Kingdom

Pay rate: DOE, Competitive

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
OmniTI is a 8-years profitible, self-funded, US based software and services
company that is a global leader in providing extensible high-performance
email systems to ISPs, ESPs and the Global 1000.  We're looking for a
competent C and Perl programmer to provide core engineering work, proof of
concept implementations for customers and assist with the technical aspects
of sales and evaluations in the United Kingdom (near London).

OmniTI's flagship product is an MTA called Ecelerity.  Ecelerity is an
advanced email application server focusing on extensibility and
performance.  It has a high-performance core that can process well over a
million emails per hour (inbound and outbound) with full policy enforcement
(both through partner technologies as well as an extensive set of in-house
anti-spam and policy management tools).  The core is written in C with a
very healthy and extensive API for extending it (like Apache's module
system).  On that API is grafted a perl runtime (like mod_perl), a Java
runtime and a PHP runtime so that operators and implementors can write
custom business logic and policy techniques in C, Perl, Java or PHP and
have them run within the SMTP transaction.  The whole system is pluggable
from soup to nuts.

We're looking for someone to help tackle new bugs, improve the perl runtime
and help tackle proof-of-concept implementations for UK customers
evaluating the product.

This is an opportunity to work with one of the most advanced system
architectures in existence today as well as be up-to-your eyeballs in
extremely high performance perl code.  To give some numbers, in the lab we
can hit 4.5 million messages/hour and around 100,000 concurrent SMTP
sessions all on commodity hardware.

This position is a telecommute position, with approximately 20% travel to
existing and potential customer sites in the UK.

Required skills:
A excellent grasp of C, Perl, XS, Perlembed, PerlAPI/Perlguts is required
as well as a good understanding of Internet email and how it works.  The
system is both threaded and event-based, so a substantial comfort-level
with thread-sage programming techniques and non-blocking, callback-based
architectures is necessary. 

Solid communication skills and the ability to interface with customers on a
technical level is required. 


Desired skills:
Understanding of SMTP from a protocol level as well as knowledge of
emerging trends in anti-spam technologies are a plus.  

A good grasp of (or lack of hatred for) JNI is also a plus -- as
enhancements made to the perl runtime must find their way back to
Java-land.
