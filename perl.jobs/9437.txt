Job title: Web data extraction ninja coder

Company name: Axiombox

Location: Anywhere, Anywhere, Anywhere

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
I'm looking for a developer with interest in Web data harvesting and
scraping. I'm currently developing a number of projects with this model and
I cannot continue doing them alone. You will be a vital part of these fun
projects: I usually enjoy doing them, you should be into that too :)

You can be anywhere in the world, I don't care as long as results are
shown.

I'm looking for a long-term partner for this, not a hit & run.

Required skills:
I need you to understand intermediate Perl, OO-design and medium to complex
implementations.

You need to have a working skillset of regular expressions.

Knowledge and understanding of HTTP basics is vital too. I use an HTTP
sniffer + Firebug most of the time.

A UNIX (Linux or MacOS) background would be a plus.

Git is an extra plus. If you are into Subversion, you'd be willing to
convert to Git :)

Desired skills:
Perl modules mostly used: WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent (good
understanding of it, to extend Mech), HTML::TreeBuilder, HTML::Parser (and
its descents), CGI::Fast, Modern::Perl, Moose (beginning to move most of
our codebase to real OO), Module::Install, Module::Pluggable and sometimes
cool stuff like Catalyst, HTTP::Engine and mod_perl 2.
