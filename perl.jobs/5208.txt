Job title:
Agile Perl Developer for Enterprise Network Management Software

Company name: AirWave Wireless

Location: United States, CA, San Mateo

Pay rate: 80-90K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
use Test::More;

ok( $you->writes_tests_first() );
ok( $you->strives_for_simplicity() );
ok( $you->enjoys_problem_solving() );

Do you pass these tests? If so, you should come write software at AirWave
Wireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), which means we spend
most
of our time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback
loops
speak louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings.
We
practice test-driven development and have a comprehensive suite of tests...
over
25,000 at last count. We pair program, which means you'll learn the system
quickly and have a great time doing it. We have short release cycles so
your
talents won't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of
day. Software you write today will be managing enterprise networks in just
a
couple of weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP
project
in the industry (five years and counting) so we have gotten quite good at
embracing its advantages while avoiding the pitfalls.

Excited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. AirWave developers write software
in
several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux
systems. We
use Apache mod_perl for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for our backend
persistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge of network
protocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP.

We build network management software that is used by many of the leading IT

organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major universities, hospitals, and
other
prominent institutions. Rolling out a wireless network is a daunting task,
and
we provide tools to ease that burden. Our industry-leading software helps
plan,
configure, manage, and monitor some of the largest wireless networks on the

planet.

Responsibilities: The software engineer's responsibilities include
designing,
writing, testing, and maintaining code that is part of a shipping
enterprise
network management and monitoring software package.

So, is this the job for you? Are you the next member of the AirWave
development
team just waiting to be discovered? If so, send your resume to
jobs@airwave.com
and I'll get right back to you.
