Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Pictopia

Location: United States, CA, Emeryville

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Software Engineer will assist in maintaining and further evolving
Pictopia’s software-directed systems, primarily on the back-end.  As for
our photo fulfillment systems, the operations include production, image
gallery, and transaction processing; at the corporate level, these include
internet hosting and monitoring, system administration, search indexing,
and database management, among others.

Responsibilities:
• Bug fixes
• Minor application enhancements
• Major application additions/changes
• Develop tools to better support Account Executives, Customer Service, and
other developers
• Create tools to monitor system and application processes
• Assist with Linux, Apache, and MySQL administration and troubleshooting


This is a high-visibility position within a very small team, and the ideal
candidate will be a dedicated, hands on professional who can take ownership
of tasks with minimal oversight. We value positive attitudes and
professionals who can successfully navigate through ambiguous and
challenging situations. Candidates are required to be on-site in our
Emeryville offices, as there is a high degree of interaction between all
parts of the business.

We offer an exciting and unique opportunity for the ambitious developer who
wants to play a large part in one of the net’s next e-commerce sensations!

Compensation is comprised of both salary and equity incentives.

About the Company:
Pictopia.com, located in Emeryville, California, provides highest quality
photo prints to consumers via purchases made at its own web site and at the
sites of its partners. Over 800 of the world’s top media organizations
including National Geographic, The US National Archives, The Washington
Post, AOL and Yahoo, The Associated Press and AFP, The NBA and MLB, have
partnered with Pictopia to monetize their vast image holdings via sales to
the public.  By taking the partners' image archives and feeds direct to the
public, Pictopia creates brand-promotion opportunities and revenue streams
that have not previously existed.  As an example of how we work today, if
you are browsing the Washington Post web-site and see a picture you want to
own for yourself, when you click to “buy” the picture, it takes you to our
web-site and we handle all the transaction order and fulfillment.

We are a privately funded entrepreneurial venture which has recently made a
strategic and management restructuring.  At this new stage of our growth,
we are very excited to be advancing to the next level in our company’s
development!

Culture:  At Pictopia we have a relaxed, intimate and informal environment.
 As a growing dot com we work hard but like to have fun doing it.  Every
team member is a valuable contributor to achieving the company’s
objectives.  Our flat corporate hierarchy supports team players, not strong
egos.

setting including:

• Medical, Dental, Vision and prescription coverage
• Health care Flexible Spending Account
• Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
• Basic Life and Personal Accident Insurance
