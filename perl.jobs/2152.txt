Company name: ActiveState- A Division of Sophos

Location: Canada, BC, Vancouver

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
You like to work with heterogenous systems (from cutting edge to oddball),
get your kicks from a smoothly running build farm, and obsessively automate
everything.  You like keeping machines humming, enjoy the challenges of
heterogeneous networks, and collect idiosyncratic bits of knowledge about
operating systems as a hobby.
Along with solid technical skills, you possess the ability to work as
comfortably and effectively as a team member as you do working alone, eager
to help and to learn.


Required skills:
-Solid build engineering experience (build systems, makefiles, etc) 
-Unix shell and Perl scripting experience 
-Solid experience with SCM tools and environments (prefer Perforce)
<li>Experience with Solaris, Linux, Windows


Desired skills:
-Knowledge of (or interest in) Windows & Unix packaging mechanisms 
-Experience of HP-UX & AIX 
-Experience in configuration management, release management 
-Python and/or Tcl scripting experience 
-Knowledge of bug tracking systems, especially Bugzilla
-Prior experience programming in Perl & C
-Good understanding of Unix software layout conventions
-Experience building and testing Windows applications
-Experience installing/configuring database servers, web servers, LDAP and
SNMP


Contact information:
ActiveState is the leading provider of tools and services for dynamic
languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and XSLT. The key features of
dynamic languages: high-level, dynamically typed and open source, make them
ideally suited to building loosely coupled systems that adapt to changing
requirements. 

These languages solve real programming challenges, proving themselves both
in spite of-and thanks to-their independence from corporate platform
strategies. 

From high-quality language distributions for general purpose scripting; to
professional development, debugging and deployment tools; to services that
ensure peace-of-mind and stability of essential systems, ActiveState is
committed to providing dynamic tools for the dynamic languages powering
essential projects everywhere, from the birth of the web to tomorrow's
challenges.
