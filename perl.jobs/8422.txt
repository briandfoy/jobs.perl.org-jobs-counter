Job title: Web Application Senior Software Engineer

Company name: Pearson

Internal ID: CTG-178

Location: United States, MA, Boston

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Technology is transforming the way we educate students.  Pearson
understands this fact, and it is committed to playing a leadership role in
the transformation.  The software development group you would be joining,
referred to internally at Pearson as the “Mastering” team, is responsible
for an online homework / tutoring system for college science students.	The
specific products are called: MasteringPhysics, MasteringChemistry,
MasteringAstronomy, and MasteringBiology.  We are extremely proud of these
products – they are based on educational research done at M.I.T. and they
have proven very effective.

The Mastering product line is currently built on top of standard web
technology: Perl, Flash, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, MySQL, and Apache.  It is a
high-throughput database application that services hundreds of thousands of
students.

We are looking for a Senior Web Developer to help with both design and
implementation.  We are expecting continued rapid growth in usage of the
platform as well as continued demands for new functionality.  To satisfy
these demands we will need to continually refactor the application as well
as build entirely new subsystems.

We are most interested in raw intelligence, deep web application
experience, and a go-anywhere, do-anything attitude.  We are looking for
someone who is happiest when the entire codebase is his/her playground. 
That said, right now we are particularly interested in candidates with
expertise in User Interaction / User Experience technology.  We are just
starting to plan out significant UI/UX changes, and we need someone with
experience in web UI/UX technologies to interact with out our existing
UI/UX product management and design folks.

The emphasis is on getting good work done effectively rather than on
adhering to someone’s idea of perfect process.	It is a small development
team.  You can have a major impact on the team dynamics and the product’s
evolution.  

If you would like to know more about our products, take a look at the
websites for each product:
•	www.masteringphysics.com	(click on the “Listen to Dr. David
Pritchard” link)
•	www.masteringchemistry.com
•	www.masteringastronomy.com,
•	www.masteringbiology.com


Required skills:
QUALIFICATIONS:
•	Web application design and implementation expertise
•	Experience with UI/UX technologies – both browser and server-side
•	Good communication skills – ability to work effectively with
product management and UI/UX designers
•	Perl (or equivalent) expertise
•	Software Engineering Background 
•	Smart, Dedicated, Team Player
•	Comfortable working on a large (but organized) software project
•	Experience with multi-tier, high-throughput web applications
•	Database programming experience, working knowledge of SQL

•	Science, Engineering, and/or Math background is a plus
•	Educational / Teaching background is a plus 
•	Experience with the general Open Source toolset is a plus
