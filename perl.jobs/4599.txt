Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: Hearst Magazines

Location: United States, NY, New York

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Hearst Magazines is looking for software developers to participate in the
development of a variety of systems, most notably:  dynamic content
websites, back-end administration tools for content management, ecommerce
systems, registration / profiling systems,  various custom applications, as
well as internal reporting products.

Significant experience working in a Unix environment (preferably Linux),
strong Perl development skills, and experience with some relational
database (Oracle, Sybase, MySQL, or Postgres) are all an absolute must.  A
working knowledge of HTML, XML, and JavaScript is expected.  Experience
with AJAX and CSS is a plus.  Previous work with secure servers and
ecommerce systems is also a plus.  

This is a software development position, however experience with mod_perl,
MySQL, and/or HTML::Mason is a big plus.  Other things we'd find to be a
plus are experience with Apache configuration, Linux system administration,
and any database administration.

In addition to other engineers, you will interact with business analysts,
designers, and a marketing staff to build great online products and
reporting tools.  Excellent written and verbal communication skills are
essential.

The position is located in midtown NYC.
