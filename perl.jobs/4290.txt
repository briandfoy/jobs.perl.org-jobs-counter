Currently the development team is designing the second generation version
of this platform, using state of the art open-source technology like
Perl/CGI, mod_perl, Apache2, Unix (Linux/FreeBSD), C/C++, XML, MySQL, SMPP,
CPAN-style packaging, etc. Object-oriented programming, continuous
integration, module testing and version control guide development.

responsibilities he/she deserves.

content, make our own commercials and TV formats (including: auditions,
photographing and post-production), buy our own television air time around
the globe and develop and maintain our own platform to deliver SMS content
worldwide. Your co workers are working in Amsterdam, Dublin or New York.
This interesting mix of creative, technical and sales personalities with
over 10 different nationalities, results in a very challenging and dynamic
work environment.
