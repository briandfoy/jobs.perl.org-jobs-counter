Software Jobs

If you're a top notch programmer and a fan of movies and TV, we've got the
ideal job for you.

There are many good reasons to work at IMDb, and here are three of them:

    * You can make a huge difference at IMDb. We've already developed a
successful business model and a stable production environment, so our
programmers spend their time developing and launching cool projects with
little red tape and lots of autonomy.

    * We offer flexibility both in terms of your day-to-day work schedule
and also in terms of work assignments.

    * Our software developers provide lots of creative input into projects
and get to work on many different types of projects that allow them to
think creatively and to handle interesting computer science challenges. 

All software positions require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer
science with three plus years of industry programming experience. Our
primarily development language is Perl in the Linux/Unix environment, so a
solid base of skills in OO Perl and working knowledge of database
integration (MySQL or Postgres) are the core skills required for all
positions.

   1. Software Developer, Data Team (Two positions: Bristol, UK and Seattle
Washington). We are looking for a senior member of our data team to enhance
our data collection and data management processes. As a member of the data
team you are producing technology and tools that are targetted to our
internal staff data managers and collect/analyse the incredible amount of
data we get daily from numerous IMDb submitters. You must have strong
relational database background (db modelling & schema definition) and
database performance tuning in the Linux/Unix environment. Please note that
although there is data modelling in this position, the data team positions
are primarily full-time software development positions.

   2. Software Developer, Tech Team (Seattle). The tech team is a client of
the data team, and creates, maintains and enhances our customer facing
websites. In addition the critical core Perl/Db skills, a primary
competency in client side development toolkit(s) such as Javascript, DHTML,
AJAX, Mason or Flash is required. We'd like to see a secondary optional
advanced competency in one or more areas such as web services, windows
client development, expert systems, natural language processing. We would
be able to customize where we take this role depending on the advanced
competency you have to offer, so if you meet the core requirements have a
skill that that you think we could leverage, please let us know. 

Our staff is distributed across the planet so we need employees who can
function independently while also interacting efficiently with other team
members.

We have a great environment of talented people who work hard to make IMDb
the most credible media source on the planet.

IMDb is owned by Amazon.com, but we operate separately and have our own
technology systems. When you join IMDb, you become a full-fledged
Amazon.com employee - which means you enjoy the cohesive work environment
of a small company while also gaining the bigger benefits of working for a
Fortune 500 company. It's the best of both worlds.

We look forward to hearing from you!
