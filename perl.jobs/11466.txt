The bulk of the work for this position is in Perl, with some SQL, HTML and

productive developers with experience doing similar work in another dynamic
language with an interest in learning Perl.

We have three open positions and are interested in a range of skills and
experience levels, from entry to senior. We want smart people interested in
solving problems, getting work done and having fun.

Required skills:
    * Developing large-scale web applications involving Perl, Apache and
