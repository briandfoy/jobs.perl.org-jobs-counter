Subject: Wanted: code and design review work

i am looking for short term contracts or projects which are reviews of
perl systems and/or designs. i have been doing software architecture and
design for 25 years with 8 years of perl experience.

my services would be examining your existing code and designs, and
evaluating them based on many criteria including code quality,
efficiency, maintainability, clarity of documentation, etc.  if you are
developing a new perl based system, i can assist with its architecture,
API design, networking issues, etc.

if your system does any networking or uses any networked services, i can
help integrate Stem into it which may speed up your development cycle
greatly and lower your system's lifetime costs. see stemsystems.com for
more on stem (in fact check out the site in a few days for its first
update in a year!).

i have done code review for various projects and have improved many of
them in multiple ways. one medium sized script at akamai was reduced by
75% of it code and also ran 4 times faster. another complex parsing
system at northern light was rewritten by me (in OO perl) and ran 60
times faster. those were extreme cases and results and i don't promise i
can do that for you. but i assure you, your perl code will be much
better for my having reviewed it.

you can find my main page and resume at sysarch.com.

rates will be determined by several factors including the size of the
project, whether it uses stem (those will be discounted), etc.
