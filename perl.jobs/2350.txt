Description:
In short: We need _great_ senior developers who know
how to build large-scale systems in perl to
auto-generate and test C code. Need to be educated and
experienced, need to be nimble, and need to want
to work at a fast growing little company. Need to
be able to work both close to the metal and quite
far from it. It's a tough position to fill since few
are up to the challenge. 
___________

About Eatoni 
 
 Text entry for mobile devices is the "tipping point" technology for the
mobile internet. You need to be able to enter text quickly and easily using
a very small device. It needs to work in any language. It needs 
 to be reliable. 
 
 Eatoni has been working for over 6 years to make such technology
available. We've developed a good customer base and are profitable. Major
products in the works. 
 
 We are looking for someone to run and build out our core integration
software. 
 You will also be 
 1) involved in research and development efforts to increase the
reliability and efficiency of our text entry methods. We are constantly
making improvements and expanding our linguistic repertoire. 
 
 2) dealing directly with customers to deliver software built to their
specifications. 
 
 This is a dream job for people who 
 
 *care about the mobile internet 
 *care about linguistics 
 *think clean and powerful code is beautiful 
 *like New York City 
 *thrive in a small-company environment 
 
 Eatoni is seeking an exceptional senior developer to help build our next
generation of text-entry software. The position requires the combination of
strong theoretical understanding of algorithms and practical experience in
building large configurable and yet reliable systems in OO perl. 
 At the same time, you must have the ability to produce efficient
implementations that will be integrated into millions of devices by major
manufacturers. Ideally you will have a graduate degree in computer science,
with studies involving operating systems or algorithms and data structures.
The ideal candidate will also have 
 considerable experience working as a C programmer in a low-level
environment. The interview process will 
 require you to write code to demonstrate this knowledge. 
 
 Please do not apply unless you are extremely confident that your
background is well aligned with our needs and that your depth of technical
understanding will withstand close scrutiny. Please do not claim to have 
 experience in an area below unless you have worked in that area. It's not
enough to have read a book or heard about an issue, we're looking for solid
prior experience. 
 
 If you haven't been frightened away yet, you may either be not reading
carefully or be very good. In the case of the latter, look around
www.eatoni.com. In your cover letter, give us at least one good reason why
you and Eatoni are a good match. Submissions which do not meet this
criterion will hit the spam filter. 
 
 If you are interested in applying, we will need some sizable samples of
code (in Perl and preferably also C) 
 for analysis. There is really no substitute for this. 
 
 If possible, send samples of your finest work. However, we recognize that
code is written under varying constraints and for very different reasons
and at different stages in one's career. Therefore, if there is 
 anything you wish to tell us about your code, please include this. For
example, if the code was produced under time pressure, if there are things
you would now do differently (and why), if your coding style has changed,
if looking at your code you see other shortcomings or even bugs etc.
