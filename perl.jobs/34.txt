Subject: Looking for Perl job
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: nytshade@sinclair.net ("C.J. Collier")

Dear list,

I'm looking for a job in the Linux/Unix environment where I can use my 
Perl skills.  I've spent the last three years learning the language as 
well as supporting new users on the OpenProjects Network (#perl).  I've 
used Perl to develop web applications from hit counters to document 
publishing tools.  I have experience with the LWP, DBI and LibNet 
modules as well as a number of others.  I am interested most in web 
development, but I also have a good deal of system administration 
experience.

Please review my resume at http://65.4.25.95/resume.html and contact me 
if you are interested in hiring,

C.J. Collier
cjcollier@sinclair.net
(206) 524 4806
