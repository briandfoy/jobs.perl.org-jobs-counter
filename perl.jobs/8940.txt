Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Petersburg Holding

Location: United States, FL

Pay rate: $70,000.00 - $90,000.00

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are seeking programmers who understand that Perl is a very serious,
high-level programming language used in large, complex, high-performance
applications, and not just a scripting tool. We love Perl and so should
you. Experience with Windows will not be held against you, but development
is performed exclusively on Linux. You should be at home on Linux, BSD, or
Unix variants. 


Required skills:
Requirements 
* 3+ years programming in Perl in a LINUX environment 
* SQL experience (we use MySQL) 
* HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, CGI and Web development experience 
* Full project life cycle experience 
* Strong written and verbal communication skills 
* Highly motivated, able to work both in a team and solo 
* Ability to meet deadlines as required 
* Strong attention to detail
