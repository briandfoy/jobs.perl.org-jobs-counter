Job title:
Web Application Developer for Healthcare Software Company

Company name: Informatics Corporation of America

Internal ID: Developer

Location: United States, TN, Nashville

Pay rate: Competitive

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Come work in the fascinating healthcare industry, helping providers take
better care of their patients and getting paid to do it.  We've got a great
Perl development team that is doing some really good work, and more
business coming in than we can handle with the current team -- so we're
looking to add two more to the team in the next few months.

You will work on the Product Development team, which includes 4 Perl
coders, a full-time Web Designer, 2 QA testers and a Tech Writer.

The most important distinction about this job is that it's not a
"scripting" job.  Nothing against one-off scripts, as I write them all the
time.  But to be considered, you must have web application development
experience in Perl.

Required skills:
The Perl web skillset: Perl, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Linux

Desired skills:
Rose::DB::Object, Mason, Apache, MySQL, Oracle, Subversion, JavaScript
frameworks
