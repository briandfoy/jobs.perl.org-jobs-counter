Internal ID: Dev/Architect

Location: London, United Kingdom

Pay rate: £60k salary plus a very generous holiday package

Description:
A fantastic organisation, a recognisable web based brand Are urgently
looking for a senior developer/architect. The successful candidate will be
joining an existing team of Perl specialists committed to Perl based web
development.
 
The team works on server-side and web development projects, many of them of
a critical nature since they handle financial transactions. This is not a
pure coding role, but will require non-development aspects including
supporting or implementing effective development processes, as well as
interacting with the project management process to ensure work is delivered
reliably
and quality is high.
 
Their platform is written entirely in Perl and built on PostgreSQL, so you
should ideally have strong Perl skills and good knowledge of SQL and
relational database principles, related technologies that would be
beneficial include HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
 
The perfect candidate would feel confident to mentor other members of the
team and work to improve both code quality and process where problems are
identified.

Required skills:
- Commercial programming experience (min 3 years) - preferably but not
necessarily Perl.
- Familiarity with "modern" Perl: exposure to any of the following
beneficial (Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Moose, Dancer, Mojilicious)
- Confident experience building reliable software using unit testing,
functional testing, and continuous integration (experience with
jenkins/hudson or similar platforms would be helpful)
- Strong communicator, able to discuss future projects as well as existing
ones with members of staff with varying levels of technical understanding. 

- Good overall understanding of all aspects of server software deployment,
from TCP/IP to HTTP to IO bottlenecks. 
- Understanding of secure software development techniques (especially, but
not exclusively, as pertaining to web applications)

Desired skills:
- Ajax techniques
- RESTful server API design 
- MVC web development
- Linux systems administration
- XML/SOAP/XSD
