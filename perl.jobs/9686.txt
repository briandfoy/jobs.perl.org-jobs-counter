We are looking for an experienced PERL programmer who can do updates and

We have some good code in place, but need to add some functions that our
last programmer did not complete before moving out of town.
We want someone who is local to Las Vegas and can do work here. We also
want you to provide your own computer (that will have your preferred tools
anyway)
