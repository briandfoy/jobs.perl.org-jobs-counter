Job title: Help w/ spam attack to perl WWW forum

Company name: Cooperative Design

Location: United States, WA, Langley

Pay rate: $50-75

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Onsite: no

Description:
I have a modified WWWboard forum at:
http://countryplans.com/bbs/countryplans1.html (multipage version of main
file index.html).

I know I should move these messages to a more secure forum structure and
would be interested in hearing suggestions for that software. 

My immediate need, however, is that spammers are posting message ads for
medicinals on the forum and I'm spending a hour a day deleting them. 

I would like someone to help clean up the error code (404) and bad words
code procedures, which are not working right, and then see if we can find a
way to keep these ad messages off the board.

Required skills:
Proficiency with Perl, wwwboard and similar BBS software.
