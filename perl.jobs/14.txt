Thank you all for your submissions!

Everyone has been most impressive in their credentials and their =
kindness.
The response has been overwhelming.

Unfortunately I can only work with one person and have more than I can =
respond to already.
My apologies for not responding to each and every one of those who were =
kind enough to respond.

Regards,

Keith Hansen.


REGARDING:

Would anyone in the community be interested in consulting for a limited =
scope project for a day or two.
The project is for a well known Corporation that would look great on any =
one of our resumes.

 The technical objectives are fairly straight forward:

    1) Connect to a fixed URI to pickup an authentication cookie.
    2) Assemble a second URI with fields derived from an Oracle table.
    3) Submit the second URI (using the cookie from step 1) to a static =
HTTP server.
    4) Query the static HTTP session id (returned in step 3) for status =
feedback of request.

    Misc.:
        - The environment is Solaris and Oracle Web Application Server =
(and maybe Apache.)
        - The wrapping logic will be taken care of.  I only need the =
specific routines for=20
           the Connect, Assemble, Submit, and Query.

If you are interested in more information and are well versed in the LWP =
module of perl, please reply.

Keith Hansen.
