Job title: Developer - Music and Metadata

Company name: state51

Location: London, UK

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
state51 makes a platform to manage music and metadata. Working with
successful indie labels, major labels and distributors this software has
delivered millions of tracks to hundreds of music services around the
world.

We are based in east London and part of a group of companies all working
with music. We're very old in internet years, but we're always developing
new and interesting ideas. We now have a vacancy for one exceptional
developer to take our platform and other music related projects forward.

The developer team you'll be joining is small and in control of its own
tools (Catalyst, Moose, Git, Puppet) and environment.

This position is onsite, telecommuting is not an option.

Required skills:
The current code is a large set of persistent objects developed in modern
Perl, so there will be a lot of that, but experience as a professional OO
developer will be valued over any particular language as we look for any
good way to achieve results.  We would prefer 
someone who gets their hands dirty rather than specialising in one thing.
Years of experience are not necessary - someone who is keen and has a
can-do attitude is a priority.

Desired skills:
An interest in music is desirable. Any mention of Silicon Roundabout is
said with thick irony.
