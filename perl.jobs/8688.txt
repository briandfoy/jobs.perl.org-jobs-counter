Job title:
Web 2.0 Art Web: Perl 5 Mason, MySQL, Gits

Pay rate: $20 - 25 USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 3 - 6 months

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Hello,

We are looking for a long-term and remote (virtual team) programming
resource to support additional build out of our live web 2.0 art platform.
The pay is $20 - $25.00/hr negotiable; it may seem small but, again, this
is a  long-term relationship and we're a bunch of poor start-up geeks
ourselves. So with rent, food, and drinks, these are all that we can afford
to pay someone for the time being. We're looking for time commitment of at
least 5 to 9 hrs each day 5 days a week with a commitment of at least 3
months; alternatively you can make your own schedule and work on the
weekends or late at night. We're open to any schedule so long as you
produce and meet deadlines. We're privately funded with seed money.

We are looking for a trusted resource to help us push the platform out of
beta. You'll be working closely with our 3-member technology and design
team. We're small, unique, and informal. Everyone pitch in to get things
done as effectively and as quickly as possible with accountability laid
across the team. There's a lot of excitement to our product. Each week,
you'll get a project plan complete with UI specs and full write-up. Your
job will be to code out the new functionality as outlined in the plan.

You should be available for chat and conference call during hours of work.
Please send resume and highlighted snapshot of your Perl and DB work to
chunter26 @ gmail.com 

Thanks!

Ted
