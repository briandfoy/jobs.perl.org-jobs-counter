Description:
Small company founded in 1982 is seeking a seasoned software developer to
support our contract management services venture.  We provide web-based
services to about two thousand companies that have government contracts and
have been offering this service for several years.

The ideal applicant will be able to maintain and enhance our existing
software inventory that was developed using Perl, VB Script, SQL, etc., and
will be able to introduce new technology when it benefits the firm. The
applicant must also be willing and able to develop a thorough understanding
of our application in order to contribute as both a software developer and
an application designer.

The applicant must have the ability to enhance and maintain complex systems
developed by others, work closely with the marketing and sales team, and
comply with internal standards for process and documentation.  A history as
a developer with mainframe or other legacy systems is a plus.  The
development team typically has three to four full time staff members; each
member has primary responsibility for a significant portion of our software
inventory and backup responsibility for the other team members.

The chosen applicant will be expected to spend most of their time
accomplishing assigned and self generated tasks in response to internally
generated requirements: analyze, design, code, test, document and deliver
functional software maintenance and enhancements that operate correctly in
our test system environment and then in our production environment.

The applicant should have experience with and enjoy working in a structured
development environment using these or similar basic process documentation
and methods: requirement specifications, design specifications, change
control, peer review, change control board.

The company provides a full benefit package and offers compensation
commensurate with experience and ability.  We have a pleasant working
environment in a first class building with private offices, on-site day
care, an exercise facility, and access to the W&OD trail.

Email replies only please.  Only qualified applicants whose resume
indicates understanding of and ability to meet these requirements can
expect a response.
