Description:
Plymouth Rock, founded in 1982 by Jim Stone, former Massachusetts Insurance

Plymouth Rock, with more than $1billion in premiums underwritten and

customer satisfaction), pay attention to the feelings and needs of others,
and manifest a strong bias for action. We insist on the utmost integrity
and probity. We offer highly competitive base salaries, a very generous
