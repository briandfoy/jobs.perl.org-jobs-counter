Job title: E-Commerce Perl Developer

Company name: Double Prime

Location: Telecommute

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: long term

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Double Prime, Inc., a 12-year old ecommerce company, has built and
maintains approximately 80+ global e-commerce and marketing websites for
major Fortune 500 companies. The application layer is apache/mod_perl, with
an oracle back end managed by another group. We have datacenters in the US,
Korea, and China with ecommerce sites in the US, UK, France, Japan,
Germany, China, Russia, Korea, Brazil, and Australia, and are rapidly
expanding into other markets.

We have a team of 90 full-time engineers responsible for application
development, network infrastructure, security, reporting, and other aspects
of the business.

We are looking for 5 - 6 full-time engineers to join our team. This is a
full-time W2 position with medical / dental benefits and a 401k plan.*
Although this is a telecommuting position, the candidate must live in PA,
NJ, NY, MA, OR, CA, CO, WI, FL or CT and is required to maintain their
residence in those states to continue employment.

Required skills:
Role will include:
Developing, maintaining, and supporting existing applications and websites
built in mod_perl with client-side database operations via the perl DBI,
using Double Prime coding standards and philosophies
Technical support of client-based business requirements or enhancement
requests through development or modification
Must be able to effectively communicate on a daily basis with the client,
other third parties, and other Double Prime engineers.
Client-facing personality is a must.

This includes using your coordination, communication, time management, and
relationship-building skills in order to maintain a positive working
relationship with the client during normal and stressful times.
This includes an attitude of technical ownership to develop and drive
execution based on Double Prime standards as well as inform the client--in
non-technical terms--the current status and hurdles.

Must be aware of a daily flexible schedule. Most days will be 9 - 5, but
you must understand that tasks such as pushing files later in the day, or
getting up early for international calls are required occasionally and as
needed.

Most importantly, a thorough knowledge of OO perl is required and a
moderate understanding of Drupal preferred. More specifics are listed
below.

Desired skills:
You do not need to fit all required skills in order to secure a position
with our company - just one or more of them.
Knowledge of front-end web languages and technology (e.g. html, css,
javascript, ajax, flash) systems administration functions such as unix
account and groups, shell scripting, patching network infrastructure, e.g.
cisco switches and firewalls, IPS and VPN.
At least 2 years experience with object-oriented Perl.

â€¨Physical Demands and Working Conditions:
The physical demands and work environment characteristics described here
are representative of those an employee encounters while performing the
essential functions of this job. Reasonable accommodations may be made to
enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.
Use of computer hardware, including keyboard data entry and other office
equipment. Extended amounts of time sitting. Visual acuity to perform job
requirements. Ability to maintain mental focus on complex logic.
This candidate must be authorized to work in the US.

** TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION, PLEASE INCLUDE A SAMPLE OF YOUR OWN
PERL CODE OF AT LEAST 200 LINES AND DEMONSTRATING AN UNDERSTANDING OF
OBJECT ORIENTED PERL.**
