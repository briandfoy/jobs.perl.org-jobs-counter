Description:
Bookings is an international online hotel reservation company. It has been
growing very rapidly since its start in 1996, growth that continues today.
Our main office is in Amsterdam, opposite Rijksmuseum, and we have several
offices throughout Europe.

The Bookings websites (www.bookings.net) and applications around it are
built using Perl as the primary language.

We need one or two UNIX system administrators to join our team in
maintaining and expanding our large (100+) server collection. We would like
you to apply if you think you are good at what you do (see skills), you are
flexible (both in mindset and in hours - this is no nine to five job) and
like the challenge of a growing environment.

If you are not sure you have all the necessary skills, but you are sure you
can learn them quick, try us.

Required skills:
HUMAN COMMUNICATION skills - you can listen to and help collegues, you are
a team player, both at work and on pub occasions.

SENSE OF PRIORITY - you keep track of what is and what isn't important. You
keep using your brain.

REDHAT/CENTOS general system knowledge, rpm packaging, network installs

NAGIOS/CACTI and similar for monitoring application and system health

PERL for understanding application code, packaging, building system
management scripts.

APACHE (mod_perl would help), MYSQL replication, POSTFIX, BIND, general
TCP/IP knowledge (you've used tcpdump, ethereal and friends. You're no
stranger to iptables).

You speak ENGLISH.

Desired skills:
Additionally it would help if you have experience in the field of SECURITY.
Experience in managed HOSTING environments and REMOTE MANAGEMENT would be
considered a plus. Any experience with HIGH AVAILABILITY and redundancy
would be appreciated. 

We would prefer you to master the DUTCH language enough to attend meetings
in it.
