Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Confidential

Internal ID: KG_Perl

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: $80 - 100

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The work environment –

Located in the Flatiron District of New York, easily accessible from many
directions, our mission is to transform the way organizations manage their
database infrastructure through the use of automation. Development and QA
are sacred here and occupy a very special location – our headquarters’
Penthouse suite. You’ll be with others who love what they do. In a
nutshell, the culture is inquisitive, collaborative, and highly-energized.
And programmer casual too.

If you do work here, you will be well paid, will receive benefits and stock
options, and unlike quite a few companies these days, we also provide
relocation money for stellar candidates as well as sponsorships and
transfer visas as needed.

Even if you’re content where you are, and email us letting us know that
you're happy – but give us a chance to explain how our software developer
opportunities may be superior to your present situations.

But if you’re looking for a new place where you can expand your use of OOP
– C++ and Perl – surrounded by recognized experts, email us your resume and
your best code sample – please, do not send any code that is the
intellectual property of anyone but you (if we receive code that is owned
by someone other than you, it will be immediately deleted). The rest could
be history…


Required skills:
Significantly skilled with Perl (C++, PHP receive bonus points) 
Solid experience in TCP/IP network and/or distributed systems programming 
Working with one or more of Oracle/DB2/Sybase/MSSQL 
Fluency in Linux and/or flavors of UNIX 
Team lead experience would be very nice to have
