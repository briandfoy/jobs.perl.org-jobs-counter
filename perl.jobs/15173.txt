hotel reservation service in the world) is looking for hands-on Team Leads
in back end to contribute to development of the biggest travel website due
to our company’s phenomenal success and the incumbent growth

B.responsible

Since team leads in IT spend a large part of their time hands-on, it’s
important that they get to know our development methodology and technical
stack really well. All team leads therefore start as a developer in one of
our teams. After you finished training and depending on your readiness,
we’ll look for a team for you to lead.

We primarily use Perl for
development. It’s ok if you haven’t used Perl before – as long as you are
willing to learn it. We use MySQL with Memcache and Redis where necessary.
We use Git for source control and our deployments are also closely tied to
it.

At Booking.com we work in small (4-5 people) agile teams. Each team
owns a part of our product and works on it independently.

As a Team Lead
you should be able to:

- Write code and play an active role in developing
new features for a high performance, scalable web platform.
- Work with the
team and the product owner to define a prioritized backlog of stories that
the team will tackle during a given sprint.
- Monitor team’s progress and
take ownership of removing any impediments that slow the team down.
-
Mentor people on the team and help them improve their game.
- Assess and
communicate how your work impacts business and other systems.

Desired skills:
B.skilled

- You are a technically strong candidate with a minimum of 5
years experience of working on a large web product
- You have a sound
understanding of programming fundamentals and know how they apply to highly
scalable web based systems
- You are comfortable making hands-on
contributions, i.e. write code that is deployed to production servers
- You
have led a small team before and like working with people
- You have a
pragmatic outlook and excellent communication skills

B.offered

This
position is open to candidates worldwide and for the right candidates we
provide Visa and Relocation assistance.

IT is the core of our business and
we ensure that we give the best ‘deal’ possible, to our employees. Here is
what you get:

Living and working in Amsterdam, one of the most
cosmopolitan cities in Europe
Contributing to a high scale, complex, world
renowned product and seeing real time impact of your work
Working in a fast
paced and performance driven culture
Career Advancement via Online and
