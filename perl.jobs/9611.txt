Job title: Senior perl/LAMP developer

Company name: MOB

Internal ID: dev-sen-200911-01

Location: Australia, NSW, Sydney

Pay rate: AUD$85-90,000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We have an opening for an experienced perl/LAMP developer.  Must be
comfortable with an OO approach to developing modular code and while you
should be comfortable with the popular frameworks you must NOT be a fire
and brimstone zealot for "just" one of them!

We offer a fun work environment with cool projects for high traffic live
events like http://SculpturebytheSea.com and cool new technologies like
Mobile and marker based Augmented Reality.

We release early, release often and love to learn from watching people
really use our applications.  

If you enjoy creating reliable, scalable perl-based web applications that
people really use then we have a home for you!

Required skills:
perl, mod_perl, DBI (and other CPAN goodness), SQL, bash and a good
understanding of ECMAScript style languages (javascript/actionscript/etc). 


You should be comfortable with configuring apache and not be afraid of
administering postgres or mysql databases.

You should have a love of automating things and be comfortable with
adopting new technologies.

Desired skills:
Experience with TWiki/Foswiki would be a benefit and experience with other
development languages like php, C/C++, Ruby, Python or non-IDE driven java
would be useful too, but not essential.
