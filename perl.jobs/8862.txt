Hours: Full time

Description:
RealNetworks Germany is looking for a skilled and experienced Software
developer, who will be 
working on various international projects. Main focus - especially in the
beginning  - will be the 
relaunch and extension of a RealNetworks music service.  
  
The candidate will work as a full member of our existing team of developers
in Hamburg  and will be  
working with the currently used systems as well as contributing ideas and
experience  to keep  
efficiency and scalability of the systems at a top level. At the same time
the candidate will contribute  
ideas and experience when it becomes necessary to change the used systems
to meet the requirements  
of our high trafficked and high performing websites.   
 
Generally, the candidate will be working on conception, code development
and optimization, 
functionality and feature changes, technical re-designs,  project launches,
DB conception and ERD 
design. 
 
Due to time- and revenue critical projects and communication between widely
separated time zones, 
willingness to work at unusual times is necessary even if this will only
happen from time to time or in 
critical phases. 

Required skills:
OO Perl, Catalyst Framework, OO PHP 4+5, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle),
Linux, Apache, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, XML, CVS & SVN, Fluent in English
