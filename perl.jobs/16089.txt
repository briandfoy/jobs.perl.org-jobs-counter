Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Adestra

Location: Oxford, UK

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for a bright, enthusiastic, experienced Perl developer to
join our Oxford-based team to assist with the ongoing development of our
SaaS email marketing platform.

Here's a bit of information about our
codebase and how we work:

We use Catalyst as the framework for our main
application server, and we have another (very high volume and much more
specialised) webserver running the Plack-based Starman. Almost everything
passes through one of those two systems. Our ORM layer uses DBIx::Class,
and pretty much everything else is a Moose class.

While we've been around
a long time, we did a ground-up rewrite of our application layer a few
years back, so we don't have tons of ancient code in dark corners. Maybe
more importantly, we prioritise code quality and maintainability over
releasing features quickly, so it's generally a fairly pleasant codebase to
work on.

We're constantly looking for ways to improve what we do, so we're
pushing heavily to improve our processes by employing things like Modern
Perl techniques, test-driven development and agile project management
processes where we can. We're a fairly small team willing to make changes
where necessary to make the best product we can.

Day to day work can
include anything and everything from database schema design and
optimisation, high-throughput scaling work, simple things like small
bugfixes and enhancements, to.. almost anything else related to our
platform. One of the biggest benefits of working in a small team is you'll
have the opportunity to try out new things and make a real difference to
our platform.

Desired skills:
Successful candidates would ideally be experienced Perl programmers,
although we're willing to consider someone with experience with a similar
language and a willingness to learn Perl. We would expect at least some
experience with creating web-based applications.

 * Perl
 * Databases,
particularly PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems like Redis
 * Web-based
application development
 * API design

Here are some of the technologies we
use heavily, experience with any of these would be very beneficial:

 *
Moose
 * Catalyst
 * PSGI/Plack
 * DBIx::Class
 * PostgreSQL
 *
FreeBSD/CentOS
 * SQL and PL/PGSQL
 * UI/UX design
