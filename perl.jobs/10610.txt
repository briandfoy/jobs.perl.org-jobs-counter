Job title: Catalyst / Perl programmers wanted

Company name: Ionzero

Location: United States, CO, Fort Collins

Pay rate: DOE

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Interested in Modern Perl programming including tools such as Moose,
DBIx::Class and Catalyst? 

Ionzero is a software development consultancy company. We have customers
around the US and around the world. Our job is to figure out how our
customers' software can be better, and then make it so. We set out to
create the kind of company we always wanted to work for where there were
good people, interesting projects, solid software and flexible (and
reasonable) hours. We've accomplished that for the last 6 years and now our
business is expanding faster than ever before. 

We work in many languages (Perl, PHP, Java, whatever our customers need)
but right now we are looking for programmers with Perl experience,
preferably using modern tools such as Moose, Catalyst and DBIx::Class. CPAN
knowledge is a must. Published modules on CPAN are a BIG plus. 


Our clients are all over the place, so you need to be able to work well via
email and our project management system. You must be self motivated and we
expect that if you say you will do something, you will. You won't last in
this job if you don't. But if you CAN do that and write good solid code, we
want to talk to you. 

This is a full time telecommute position. We have staff all over the
country. If you're nearby, all the better. The position is contract to
start, then once we know you are a good fit, you'll go permanent. 

If this all sounds good to you, send a resume along with sample code and
your salary requirements. 

Required skills:
* Modern Perl (and Object Oriented concepts tools like Moose) 

* Catalyst web framework 

* SQL databases (particularly MySQL and Postgresql) 

* Familiarity with CPAN

* Web technologies such as HTML / CSS / Javascript

* Version control (SVN / Git / etc.) 


Desired skills:
DBIx::Class a big plus.  Plack, other web technologies.
