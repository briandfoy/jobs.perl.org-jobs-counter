Job title: Perl/ MySQL/ HTML Staffer

Company name: Miranet

Internal ID: Production

Location: United States, California, San Jose

Pay rate: Fair

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 2 Weeks (Contract to Hire)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are a small IT Consulting/ Web Application Development Firm. We have a
temporary slot open to fulfill our obligations to a variety of clients with
monthly service contracts. We maintain web sites and web applications
developed and deployed by our firm. In this position, you would almost
exclusively provide service and support to existing clients/ applications.
This support ranges from simple text corrections to bug fixes to the
creation of new features/ functions. 

While you will be an integral part of the Engineering team, you will be
required to interact (verbally and through e-mail) with non-technical
people on a daily basis.

The person currently filling this position is off for two weeks. We are
considering the possibility of expanding our staff and making this position
permanent after the two weeks.

We're looking to fill this position immediately. Please... no calls. Send
your resume and contact information. If you appear to be a fit, I'll call
you back right away.


Required skills:
Perl (OO Methods prefered)
MySQL
HTML
(Some) PHP 

Desired skills:
We unfortunately support a handful of legacy applications developed using
various Microsoft languages (we're not happy about it and we're actively
re-writing them in Perl as we have time; but we have to deal with them
during the transition). So, any experience (even passing familiarity) with
ASP, VB, VBScript, IIS and MS-SQL would be helpful; but not required.
