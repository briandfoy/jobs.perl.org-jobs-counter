Job title:
Perl/DBI/HTML programmer for the SurfShopPRO eCommerce System

Company name: The Working Mac

Location: United States, Washington, Seattle

Pay rate: see description

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a serious person to take over the development of the
SurfShopPRO eCommerce System.  SurfShop is an existing, Perl based shopping
cart that has many nice features, with some not being found in any program
in it's price range.  There is a list of bugs that need to be fixed first,
plus new features that need to be added.  We are looking to make this the
best cart on the market.  If you'd like to take a look, a demo can be
downloaded from our site.

This would be a telecommuting job, so you can reside anywhere, however a
mastery of the English language is a must - spoken and written.  If at all
possible, we would prefer someone in the Puget Sound area so that we could
meet.

All code must be commented extensively and participation in the support
forum is required.

Pay will be 40% of the profit from all sales (USD), and 60% of all custom
work.  Plus, we can pay a $1,000.00 flat fee to fix a predetermined list of
bugs.

This is an opportunity with great potential.  It is not a get rich quick
scheme.  We are looking for someone to partner with for the foreseeable
future.  Serious inquiries only, please.

Required skills:
You must be willing to hit the ground running, and have a thorough
knowledge of Perl, DBI, MySQL (also ASCII and DBM databases), HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript, and be willing to take over an existing project.  Knowledge
of other technologies would be a plus.
