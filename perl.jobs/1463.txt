Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: FatCow Web Hosting, LLC

Location: United States, NM, Albuquerque

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
New Mexico’s largest Web Hosting company needs an experienced Perl
developer. Come join our team in beautiful New Mexico, where there's blue
skies, magenta
mountains, and tons of code to write.
    You will maintain and enhance our internal applications and customer
tools. You'll also help develop new products and services in a
Solaris/Apache/MySQL environment. And you can share in the challenge of
refactoring and redesigning a large, existing codebase to support continued
growth, improved performance, and new business. In other words, you'll have
fun.
    You're sure to get our attention if you have 3+ years experience with
modern Perl development, and 2+ years with relational databases, preferably
MySQL. You should have 3 or more years experience developing for Unix or
Linux systems, ideally including Solaris. We'd prefer a
bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field. You must be a US
citizen or have a green card. Social skills wouldn't hurt.
     We are a 6-year-old, privately held, growing, and profitable company
with around 30 employees. We believe in balancing work and real life, so we
offer flexible hours, a casual office, and a reasonable workload. You'll
have time to enjoy the 300+ annual days of sunshine in
Albuquerque, where you'll find plenty of cultural variety (dim sum to
posole) and ample parking wherever you go (something NY and San Fran can't
offer!). We provide comprehensive benefits, including a 401(k) plan with
matching. 
    If you've been nodding along (not nodding off), please email your
resume in plain text, PostScript, PDF, Open Office, or executable Perl to
iwantajob@fatcow.com.


Required skills:
Perl development, relational databases (MySQL), developing for UNIX or
Linus systems including Solaris, BS in CS.

Desired skills:
BS in CS, 3+ years Perl development, 2+ years relational databses,
preferably MySQL, 3 + developing for UNIX or Linus systems including
Solaris.
