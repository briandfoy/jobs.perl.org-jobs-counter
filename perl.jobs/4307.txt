Job title: Hacker with people skills

Company name: athenahealth

Location: MA, watertown

Pay rate: 50-100K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We're looking for hard-core hackers who love working with people.  

You're the kind of person who has always excelled at whatever it is you do,
and can pick up new skills at the drop of a hat. You find it difficult to
turn down a good challenge, and have secretly harbored dreams of either
galactic peace or galactic domination.	

You love working with other excellent people, but are equally comfortable
sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper and molding reality. You know
that you can do the impossible if only you would be given a little bit more
time, but you also know you can accomplish a whole lot more if you work
with trusted colleagues.  

You may not know a lot about healthcare now, but you know that it's badly
broken; that it's some insane percentage of our GDP and growing rapidly;
and that it's a problem that you can get passionate about. 

About athenahealth-- we've been around for about 7 years now, and are
located in Watertown, MA (just outside Boston). We've been backed with $40
million in venture capital from A-list VC's-- VCs who provided some of the
original money behind Apple, Home Depot, Intel, Office Depot, Whole Foods,
etc-- but the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise
any more capital.  

Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to you. The working
environment is friendly and open. The folks you'll be working with are top
notch, and will probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've
ever worked with regardless of where you're coming from-- Harvard/MIT/CMU
grads, former professors, and just plain smart people who took the road
less traveled.	

If interested please send your resume and a solution to the following
puzzle.

You and a friend are about to eat a pizza. You know that it always takes
you x seconds to eat a unit of pizza, and you know it takes your friend y
seconds. Once the pizza is cut, you will both start eating at the same
time. Each person can eat only one slice at a time. You cannot touch the
next piece until you finish the one you're eating. Out of generosity, you
have agreed in advance to allow your friend to have the last slice if you
should both happen to reach for it at the same time. Assuming that you
would like as much of the pizza as possible to end up in your stomach, into
how many equal-sized slices should you cut the pizza?


Required skills:
In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of DHTML, CSS, and
JavaScript thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we
believe any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of
a couple of months or so. We're more interested in folks with raw talent
and a burning desire to succeed.

Job Requirements : The Technologist should possess the skills necessary to
participate in the application programming of an Internet application.
(S)he must be able to prioritize and complete  multiple tasks efficiently
and accurately. 

<ul> <li> Substantial expertise in at least one of the following
programming languages: C, C++, Perl, Java, Visual Basic, etc.
<li> A keen and inquisitive intellect
<li> Ability to function as an integral part of the technology development
team <li> Willingness and ability to work unpredictable and often late
hours <li> Preferred skills include previous web development experience,
UNIX/Linux familiarity, Perl, Java, RDBMS experience (particularly with
Oracle) and Palm Pilot development familiarity <li> Experience in the field
of healthcare, particularly in billing/financials, is extremely
helpful</ul>
