Description:
This is a quick job, from what I've been told. I have no knowledge of Perl
and PHP, thus I am asking if anyone would be available to construct peices
to a site for me. It is a site for a group ("guild") based from neopets.com


The base HTML is done by me and a couple other people, we need to intigrate
a database into it, that has these features:

1. Unlimited number of users should be able to create accounts with unique
usernames.  Each username must have a password created by the user, and be
capable of being associated with a link to a "rules" page that they
specify.

2.  Each user should be able to submit an unlimited number of "internet
pets."	A pet is defined as a GIF image, associated with a name, species,
identification link, and color. (see http://tno.kraylus.com/foster.php for
a rough example)

Each pet when displayed should come up with the owner's name (linked to the
owner's rules page), an image of the pet (which is shown based on the
submitted species/color specifications), the pet's name (linked to the
pet's identification page) (see http://tno.kraylus.com/adopt/ for a rough
example; but I'd much rather have it be a list based on species, as opposed
to a room/wing thing)

In the past, we had a former site that was able to take the information
from the source, and fill in information about the particular "pet"
associated on neopets.com based on the unique pet name. They were only
allowed to submit the "pet" if the account the pet was housed in was A. a
member of the guild and B. listed as an alternate "foster account"


I'd also like to set up a forum, to update news, that a select few people
can use to update the news page (for an example, go to http://pinkpt.com/)


I need minimum commitment, set up of the site, then maintenence if
something happens to that part of it. However, since none of the (4) people
working on it know anything about perl or PHP, that we should be able to
edit the layout (html) without having to mess with the PHP or the Perl.

Required skills: Perl, PHP

Desired skills: Perl, PHP, mysql
