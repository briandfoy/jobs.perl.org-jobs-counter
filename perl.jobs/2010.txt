Job title:
Linux Apache MySQL Perl (LAMP) Programmer

Company name: WireSpring Technologies, Inc

Internal ID: WS2004-Q403

Location: United States, FL, Ft. Lauderdale

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
WireSpring is looking for an experienced Linux / Apache / MySQL / Perl
(LAMP) programmer with serious DHTML, HTML and JavaScript skills to join
our web application development team.  Our candidate should have experience
using Perl to do everything from hacking together system administration
scripts to developing beautiful, complex, high-level applications, and must
be comfortable doing it in a Linux environment (we don't do Windows).

Working with our close-knit and highly seasoned technical staff, our
candidate will get the opportunity to work on a number of exciting projects
for our remotely managed Linux-based operating system and web-based
administration suite for interactive kiosks and digital signage networks. 
Our candidate's job will be about 60% application design & development, 20%
system administration (or building tools for system administration) and 20%
troubleshooting.  

Required skills:
Really required:
·	Strong knowledge of Perl (though we'll consider great programmers
who are willing to learn).  Work with object-oriented Perl is a plus, but
not required.  Ditto for mod_perl.
·	Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (our web application
interfaces use a lot of DHTML, so this is a must!)
·	Strong knowledge of SQL (we're using MySQL right now, but your
knowledge should be portable to other relational database systems)
·	Linux/BSD/UNIX server administration skills like
configuring/optimizing Apache and MySQL, writing cron jobs, troubleshooting
system problems, etc.
·	Experience designing and writing web-based applications, since
that's obviously what we're talking about here.
·	Experience using CVS or some other version control system.
·	Ability to learn new things -- quickly.
·	Sense of humor.  (Yes, it's required.)

Desired skills:
Other things that we'd like to have:
·	Graphic arts abilities - Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. to make our
web apps pretty
·	Experience using Perl to interact with XML
·	Experience writing Apache modules in C or Perl
·	Experience with lower-level system programming in C or C++
·	Experience working on large projects (many developers/lots of code)

·	Experience working on open-source projects (large or small)
·	Troubleshooting, technical support or QA experience
