Description:
HeartIT seeks a software engineer to develop, implement, and support

physicians to view and manage MRI, X-ray, CT and other medical scans,
providing a myriad of diagnostic tools using bare bones web browsers. In

delivering software to a diverse user base.  Applicants should have
experience with object-oriented programming, *NIX operating systems, and
basic networking.  Experience with PERL, Javascript, and Red Hat operating

self-motivated, and have experience working in professional teams as well
as with customers/clients.

Desired skills:
Applicant must have a BS/BA in computer/science/math/engineering, a related
major, or comparable work experience. Familiarity with LAMP (Perl)
implementations and/or Javascript a plus. Candidates must either live in or
