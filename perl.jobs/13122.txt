Company name: Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute

Location: Cambridge, UK

Pay rate:
Salary: £27,589 - £38,067 per annum dependent on experience

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Description:
We are looking for an enthusiastic software developer/engineer with
particular experience in Perl and SQL to join our successful COSMIC team
located at the Sanger Institute, near Cambridge in the UK.
COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is a large cancer genetics database &
websystem designed to hold the world’s knowledge on DNA mutations in human
cancer, providing multiple methods to mine complex data for new
discoveries. We are currently looking to enhance the system by adding new
types of information; this will require the creation of new reliable and
automated software to pipeline biological data into our database, and novel
tools to mine it.

Working closely within the existing COSMIC team, this role will
systematically identify genomic datasets from major international sources
such as the ICGC and TCGA, create a relational database to store them and
build software to automatically annotate and upload the data. 

An important focus will be to ensure the efficient and precise management
of pipelines and database systems to maximise the accuracy and speed of
data migration. The development of analysis tools will be determined within
the team, and also in discussion with our scientific collaborators. All the
data curated and all the systems built will be made publicly and freely
available to maximise the usefulness of COSMIC, with the ultimate aim of
supporting the development of improved therapies against human cancer.

Required skills:
Good degree in Computer Science or Bioinformatics, or significant
professional experience

Familiarity with developing in UNIX/Linux environment

Software engineering skills with a primary focus on using 
PERL across large datasets and databases

ORACLE/MySQL relational databases

Enjoy working as part of a team.

Desired skills:
CGI Web development, experience of biological data.
