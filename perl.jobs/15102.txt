Pay rate: $40 / hour

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Description:
Plain Black (plainblack.com) is hiring and we’re looking for a geek like
you. Not your average geek, but someone who wears GEEK as a badge. Someone
who breathes Perl, and drinks Linux. A geek who knows that there’s more you
can do with SSH than just open a terminal to a remote box. Someone who
believes that Internet access is not just a human right, but that it’s as
important as air, water, and shelter. If we’ve described you, then please
apply.

We can offer you flexible work hours, and work from anywhere. We
can offer you part time or full time contracting hours. In addition, you
get to work with some smart people on cool projects.

Desired skills:
You must be able to:
 - Work independently or as a member of a team.
 - Be
self-motivated.
 - Write modern Perl, not chicken scratch Perl, and be able
to explain the difference.
 - Use and abuse relational databases like
MySQL.
 - Be comfortable with common tools like Bash, Git, Nginx, Apache,
and Vim.
 - Know common web development technologies like Javascript, CSS,
HTML.

It would be nice if you:
 - Have experience with Perl web
development including one or more of: WebGUI, Plack, Catalyst, Dancer, or
Mojolicious.
 - Have experience with one or more modern Javascript
frameworks like jQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS.
