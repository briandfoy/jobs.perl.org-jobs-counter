Job title: Software Engineer

Company name: ePrize LLC

Location: MI, Detroit

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
As an ePrize software professional, you will bring your extensive skill-set
to our delivery team. Our developers design, code, test, document, and
support the ePrize technologies that drive our business. ePrize software
professionals command a challenging and non-traditional position that
demands a broad scope of knowledge and a high degree of individual
responsibility.  Enthusiasm for learning, aptitude for creative problem
solving, and a team oriented personality are key traits of a successful
ePrizer.
Our developers are responsible for owning and delivering on all aspects of
our technology projects. Exceptional critical analysis skills, a talent for
understanding big picture concepts, and the motivation to independently
contribute to the unlimited success of your team goes without saying. 
Daily responsibilities include:

•	Delivering reliable software that delights our customers, on time
and on budget.
•	Defining and executing on improvements to our software development
processes, habits, and techniques.
•	Communicating effectively to Project Managers, Clients, and other
audiences of all technical levels in a team environment.
•	Internalizing new technologies and procedures and applying that
knowledge to ePrize business needs.


Required skills:
Technology is always changing and so are we. We currently use Perl, Java,
JavaScript, XML, SOAP, XML-RPC, and Flash. However, ePrize software
professionals are not hired based on their current skill set but on their
proven ability to master the technologies and practices necessary to over
deliver success. If you are that go-to person relied upon to get it done
when it absolutely, positively, must be done right, we want to talk to you.
Helpful experience and knowledge includes:
•	Linux
•	Object oriented concepts and technologies
•	Relational database programming and design
•	Familiarity with social media/advertising. App development
experience is a plus.
•	Coding skills in a modern programming language
•	Web-related concepts and technologies
•	HTML/CSS
•	Agile concepts such as test driven development, iterative
development, pair programming, and continuous feedback
•	Bachelor’s Degree or equivalent work experience
•	Excellent command of written and spoken English
