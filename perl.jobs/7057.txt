Job title: Lead Perl Programmer

Company name: Tuskerdirect Limited

Location: United Kingdom, Hertfordshire, Watford

Pay rate: £40,000 - £50,000

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
We are a Contract Hire and Leasing company with a slight difference. Our
e-commerce offering is considered to be at the forefront within our
industry sector and we want to ensure that we stay there. 

We are looking for a lead programmer to head up our small web development
team and co-ordinate with our external oracle developers.  You will be
responsible for maintaining the company's websites and delivering business
identified enhancements to our award winning ecommerce platform.  Knowledge
of Perl is essential.

We maintain two public web sites and a private administration web site
deploying two web server hosts that run Apache, and one database server
running an Oracle 10g instance.  All web and database servers use Linux as
their operating system.

The Oracle instance contains one schema shared by all three web sites,
containing the data, and low-level routines implemented in Oracle PL/SQL. 
The web server host runs Apache 2 frontend processes that serve static
content and pass CGI requests through to Apache/mod_perl backend processes.
 The application layer is implemented purely in Perl, with a common code
base used by all public and private web sites.

Required skills:
A very good knowledge of Perl is essential and the ability to interact with
the Senior Management Team to develop and improve the system is required. 

Desired skills:
Management skills would be a bonus as it is envisaged that the successful
candidate will manage the entire IT function in due course.
