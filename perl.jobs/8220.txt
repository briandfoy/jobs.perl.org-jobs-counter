Job title:
mod_perl programmer for local information website

Company name: state51

Location: United Kingdom, London

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: some

Description:
The Knowhere Guide might well be the UK's longest serving UGC website,
having been online since 1994. It's running on rusty old code now and needs
a complete rebuild, and then ongoing development to keep it competitive now
everyone has copied the concept.

It's currently a mix of mod_perl handlers, with some old Embperl, and
DBI/MySQL. We have an open mind about the best tools to carry it forward.

This is a part-time onsite position.

Required skills:
Perl, mod_perl, HTML/CSS, DBI, and familiarity with the principles and
techniques of db driven templated websites.

Desired skills:
A very good sense of humour - it's a UGC site after all.
