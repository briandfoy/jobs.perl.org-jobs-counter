Description:
TigerLead is one of the most heavily-trafficked networks of real estate
sites on the web, and we are dedicated to helping home buyers and sellers
to connect with the best realtors.

This is an exciting opportunity for a sharp Senior Perl Engineer to work in
a startup-like atmosphere within a small but profitable and fast-growing
division of Move Inc (located in West Los Angeles), where your
contributions will make a direct impact on clientsâ€™ success.

Our engineering team is a fun and passionate group. We do agile development
based on Scrum, so experience with agile practices, quick iterations, and
integration of regular feedback is required. As a result, an ability to
communicate directly and effectively with stakeholders (both verbally and
in writing) to be able to define and clarify requirements is essential.


*** Responsibilities ***

- Architect and develop highly-scalable, secure, and modern web
applications. Your audience will be buyer/seller leads, our realtor
clients, and internal customers, with opportunities for both front-end and
back-end work.
- Deliver clean, functional, modular, well-documented, and well-tested
code.
- Work with our QA staff to ensure thorough functional testing, prepare
deployment plans, and identify areas of risk.
- Communicate proactively with stakeholders to help gather requirements and
translate them into functional/technical specs, and integrate their
feedback during the development process.
- Mentor junior developers, and contribute to the evolution of our
technology stack.


*** Location and Hours ***

Preference will be given to candidates who can work in our Los Angeles
office (at 1554 S. Sepulveda Blvd). This is a full-time (40 hours per week
M-F) position.


*** Additional Benefits ***

- A kitchen stocked with snacks, energy drinks, and more.
- Sharp coworkers, including Tim Bunce, who has been working with the team
for several years and recommends this opportunity.
- Contributing to open-source projects is encouraged.
- Flexible work hours (with normal core hours of 10am-4pm Pacific Time).
- A prime location just off the 405 in West LA.

Required skills:
- Senior level software engineer, with 5+ years of Perl experience.
- Strong experience working and developing within a Linux/Perl environment
(CentOS, Apache/Nginx, PostgreSQL, Perl, Varnish, Elasticsearch, etc).
- Able to architect and implement solutions to complex problems on large,
scalable web applications.
- Strong background in OOP, MVC design, and SOA / Web Services. In
particular, experience with Catalyst and/or Mojolicious, DBIx::Class, and
Moose is very desirable.
- Excellent SQL skills, PostgreSQL preferred.
- HTML and CSS skills to create web templates.
- Experience with JavaScript (jQuery) and AJAX.
- Solid grasp of source code management fundamentals (we use git and
GitHub).
- Team-first attitude, excellent communication, and interpersonal skills;
enjoy collaborating with others.
