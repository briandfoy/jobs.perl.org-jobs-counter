Job title:
Wanted Volunteer Perl, C - programmer with a passion for documentary films.

Company name: e screening room .org

Location: United States, ca, San Rafael

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 40 hours

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
PROJECT:
Alexa.com is sponsoring us to build the best search engine for documentary
films. Alex.com does a daily crawl on the web and is giving us access to
the crawl. This should enable us to build a search that 1) Identifies
documentary films only (media) and 2) identifies descriptions/reviews of
documentary films. Estimated time for basic functionality 40hr (must be
done in three weeks). Read more at
http://www.escreeningroom.org/wiki/index.cgi/DocumentaryCrawl 

The e screening room http://escreeningroom.org/ on-line website
(none-profit) dedicated to the documentary film. Documentary film fans can
watch full length unabridged films. If they like what they see they can buy
a DVD copy for home viewing. We are non-profit organization. The e
screening room is entirely created by volunteer work.

The e screening room is dedicated to create a different distribution
channel for documentary producers. Independent documentaries are born out
of the passion –often compassion - for the subject of the documentary.
Often these documentaries are self financed.  But there is little financial
gain out of documentary film. As a result, documentary producers get
discouraged and often leave the field. We think that’s a shame: to lose an
independent voice, is a loss for a free society. At the e screening room we
are changing that by connecting documentary filmmakers with their audience. 

Required skills:
We are looking for a volunteer with a passion for documentary films and in
support of the freedom of speech, with experience with Perl, some shell
experience (some cgi would come in handy). We are using agile (extreme)
programming methods. We can’t pay you anything but you get to create the
best documentary film search engine with a billion dollars in hardware
behind it.. 


Desired skills: Dedication to finish the project.
