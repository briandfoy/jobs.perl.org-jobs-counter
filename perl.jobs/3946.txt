Description:
 Helping to complete a content management system for a printed catalog.

We are looking for someone to complete this project on site. Compensation
for this position can be arranged as a contract or as a lump sum. Talk to
us about the work and tell us how much you want or how much you typically
make. The duration of this contract should be about one month. There is a
good possibility for more work in the future for this project and others.

Required skills:
Intermediate to advanced level Perl programmer who is self-directed,
familiar with UNIX/Mac Jaguar Server, Apache, mod_perl, Catalyst and
Postgres. Must be able to provide accurate estimates for reaching project
goals. 

Desired skills:
Familiarity with JSON and web apps highly preferred.
