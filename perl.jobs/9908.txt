Location: United Kingdom, Cambs, Cambridge

Pay rate: £26750 + benefits

Travel: 0-25%

Description:
The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is located on the Wellcome
Trust Genome Campus near Cambridge and provides cutting-edge research,
service and training in the field of bioinformatics.

Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) is one of the leaders in genome annotation
and one of the groups at the EBI. We are looking for an enthusiastic
software developer to join our core team at Ensembl. The successful
candidate will participate in the maintenance and development of the
databases and software that underpins the Ensembl project  


Required skills:
The ideal candidate should hold a Masters degree or higher in Computational
Science or Physical Science or a PhD in Biological Science. Candidates
should have evidence of their ability to write, understand and maintain
complex code. Previous experience of working on a large, established but
continually-evolving codebase would be a distinct advantage.

The post holder must have strong programming skills in Perl and experience
in development of SQL databases, in particular MySQL. 

We are looking for highly motivated candidates with good communication and
interpersonal skills. Furthermore, candidates should demonstrate solid
problem solving skills, excellent attention to detail, and a desire to work
in an international environment. Good English skills are a requirement. 

Desired skills:
Experience in other programming/scripting languages would be an advantage,
as would some knowledge of molecular biology and/or bioinformatics. You
should be comfortable developing software in a primarily Unix-based
environment, and be familiar with development tools such as CVS.
