Job title:
Software architect/programmer for web survey software

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Location: United States, CA, Mission Viejo

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. conducts and hosts online surveys for a variety of
clients in the market research industry.  We offer both software licensing
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we program surveys
using our own software on a project-by-project basis for clients who  would
rather outsource all survey set up.

Our core software is built using mod_perl/DBI/Apache on Linux servers.	We
need experienced software engineers to help us expand and improve on our
core software.	As the company grows this person could also serve as a team
leader for any new technical staff we hire.

Required skills:
The candidate must be able to learn our overall system architecture and
write modular, clean code to help us continually improve.  Perl, mod_perl,
DBI and PostgreSQL are the primary skills the candidate will be using day
to day.  However the ability to learn quickly and adapt is more important
than any particular technical skill.

Desired skills:
Ability to lead a team of developers as we grow is a plus.  Some client
interaction for support of new features and custom development will also be
required, so excellent communications are needed.

Ability to set up hardware (for example, installing all necessary software
on a new Linux server) is also a plus.
