Job title:
Sr. Engineer wanted to help make Request Tracker even better

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Location: Somerville, MA

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Best Practical's flagship product, Request Tracker (RT), is the premier
open source issue tracking system. Thousands of organizations depend on RT
to get their work done. Our accompanying product, Request Tracker for
Incident Response (RTIR), is the leading open source incident handling
system for computer security teams and is widely deployed across security,
academic, and government agencies.

We've been around since 2001 and are
entirely self-funded. We are proud contributors to and beneficiaries of the
free software ecosystem; our code is on GitHub.

Our office is in the heart
of Davis Square in Somerville, MA, though we all telecommute some of the
time. Our benefits include full healthcare and dental coverage, as well as
an open vacation policy.

We're seeking candidates who take pride in the
work they do. Everyone on our team is eager to build products our users and
customers love.

We're looking for:
 An intermediate- to senior-level
software engineer who is creative and collaborative. We're an engineering
organization first and foremost: every engineer has a large impact on the
future of our products and our business. We're specifically looking for
engineers with big ideas to help us reinvent our company.

RT sits in the
middle of core internet technologies including web, SQL, email, GPG/SMIME,
UNIX, and REST. Our work makes us experts in how the internet itself runs.
Furthermore, we frequently integrate RT with third-party services and
tools, so we gain a breadth and depth of experience with many applications.

This role involves all aspects of software engineering: working with
customers to figure out what they want, design, building the features that
address their needs, testing and code review, documentation, improving
performance, maintenance, and responsibly addressing security
vulnerabilities. RT is a large codebase, so you should be prepared to work
with a project that's too big to hold in your head all at once.

Desired skills:
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (or related field) or equivalent
practical experience
* Deep understanding of web technologies, ideally
Perl, JavaScript, and SQL
* Experience working in a team or on open source
using version control (we love Git!)
* UNIX systems administration,
especially for web, mail, database
* An eye for design is a big plus
