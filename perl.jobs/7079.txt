Job title: Perl Programmers for web application

Company name: Thermeon Europe Ltd

Location: United Kingdom, Surrey, Near Gatwick

Pay rate: £30-60k depending on skills

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Thermeon, the world leader in solutions for the global vehicle rental
industry for thirty years, has openings for experienced
programmer/developers at their European office based close to Gatwick
Airport, Surrey. The European office is a vital part of the global company
delivering the research and development for future global deployment.  We
maintain a relaxed working environment that lets you get the job done
whilst providing the expert support you deserve.  The office location is
surrounded by countryside with a stunning birdseye view of the airport and
a far cry from the high stress, emotionless concrete offices of nearby
London. 

Your primary objective will be our latest generation web application built
on top of our new core engine. You will work with several other team
members to deliver the project within the first year.  There will be a
substantial bonus on successful completion of the primary project inside
the deadline.  The successful candidates will have developed skills across
multiple languages and demonstrate an ability to rapidly learn and deploy
new skills, meet technical challenges, have an inquisitive nature and an
ability to work independently.	 Strong Perl or related experience would be
a major asset.	Experience with Linux and web development is essential,
system administration skills an advantage and you should be seasoned at
building professional web applications.  You will need to be experienced
with relational databases, object oriented programming and writing software
tests.	Experience with Catalyst (or similar MVC frameworks), templating
frameworks, POE or Cobol would be beneficial.

Telecommuting is a possibility if travel is difficult - own transport an
advantage.

Required skills:
Linux
Web development
Creating web applications
Relational databases
OO
Writing oftware tests

Desired skills:
Perl or similar and willing to cross-train
Catalst or similar MVC
Mason or similar templating framework
POE
COBOL
