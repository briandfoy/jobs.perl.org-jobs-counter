Job title: Perl Wanna-be

Company name: Endurance International

Location: MA, Boston (Burlington)

Pay rate: 40K USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Are you bright, eager, and becoming a little disheartened at the thought of
spending a good portion of your technical career reinstalling printer
drivers on Windows desktops? Do you really want a career writing code, but
you just don't have the experience to apply for some of the interesting
positions you see come across the jobs.perl.org board? Then this might be
just the position for you!

We're looking for a junior level perl developer. The position will involve
a lot of grunt support tasks, but you'll also participate in real
development projects as we launch new features for our web hosting
platform. Best of all, you'll be working on a team of experienced perl
programmers; If you have the desire and drive to learn, you'll be able to
gain great real world programming experience. The more programming you show
you can handle, the more you'll be given.

Our environment is mainly perl on Linux, but we also have Win2K servers,
and need to provide support to customers using ColdFusion, PHP, and .asp
scripting, so skills in any of those areas are a plus as well. It's nice if
you are at least competent in writing a “Hello World” application in perl,
but we're really looking more for people with a programming aptitude and a
desire to learn perl, rather than for people with demonstrable perl
experience.


Required skills:
-Burning desire to learn perl
-A thirst for learning
-Eagerness
-Enthusiasm


Desired skills:
-Ability to write basic perl scripts
-Familiarity with HTML, PHP, MySQL, XML/XSL, Internet protocols 
-Linux/Unix platform expertise 
-Experience with website development, website hosting, and web-based
application development 

Education and Experience: 
Bachelor's degree (B.A)
