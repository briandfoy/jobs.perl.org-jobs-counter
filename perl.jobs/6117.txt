various other forms of research as a part of the process, and the ability
to solve these puzzles is important to the job. A love of puzzles is a
definite plus.

    * Ability to program in HTML, Perl, SQL, Javascript (using AJAX) 
    * Ability to operate as both a self-starter and team player
    * Good people and communication skills
    * Eagerness to learn and a love of technology
