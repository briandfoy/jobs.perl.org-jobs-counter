Job title: Web scripting, programming, security

Company name: ACC&CE

Location: Louisiana, USA

Pay rate: open USD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Looking for someone with web programming expertise to help move our current
website to another provider, help with bug fixes and to make eventual
enhancements. I have arranged the hosting and moved content, but expect to
have scripting problems since Perl is not my expertise (some have bugs
anyway). 
Contact me if you think this may match your interest and expertise; I would
be interested in seeing your resume, website(s), etc. and an hourly rate.  
There is a members area to create and edit the profiles you see.  I am
comfortable with html and mySQL databases but need help with perl/ sql
scripting, cookies, login security, etc.

Required skills: Perl mySQL scripting, cookies, login security
