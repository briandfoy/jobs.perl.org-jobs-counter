Job title: Senior Applications Engineer and Architect

Company name: Golden Guru

Location: Internet

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We're looking for a qualified, truly senior Perl developer and architect to
join our team to build and maintain complex web applications and back-end
services across a series of different environments and for a variety of
clients. The person will oversee a team of software engineers as a
code-line lead and architect. The person must be comfortable leading a
small team, assigning tasks, and following-up on work completed (including
code reviews). The person will also be called on to research and design new
software and systems architectures.

Required skills:
We need someone with very strong with Perl and OOP, someone with strong
software architecture wisdom, and someone who can fit into a team of
equally senior engineers. We're looking for someone sufficiently senior
enough to lead projects and to handle work solo when necessary without the
need for oversight and yet who will follow our strict style guide and best
practices in all cases. Viable candidates will have a track-record of self-
motivation, high attention to detail, and ability to work very
independently.

Desired skills:
Desired skills for the position include experience with some mixture of
some of the following: Debian system administration and networking,
Mojolicious, nginx, Couch, Solr, Postgres, Git, jQuery, XHTML/CSS, and
Template Toolkit. PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile experience is a bonus.
