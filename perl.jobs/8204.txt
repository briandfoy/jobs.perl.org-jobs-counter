Job title: Improve Devel::NYTProf under mod_perl1

Company name: Confidential

Internal ID: NYTProf

Location: Telecommute

Pay rate: Bid

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
My client is using Devel::NYTProf under mod_perl1 to profile their large
application. They want several improvements and fixes to be made to this
module and the changes will be sent to the maintainer so they can update
CPAN. This module was written by a developer at the New York Times but
he doesn't have the spare time to help out.

The main problem they are seeing is with the profiler output file not
getting parsed correctly, even when running Apache in single process
mode. They also get "Inconsistent pids in profile data (pid %d not
introduced)", which is strange since they are running in single process
mode. The problems happen sporadically and aren't reliably repeatable
which makes testing difficult.

They would also like to see better support for forking, specifically
under mod_perl. They are interested in doing some load testing with the
profiler attached to look for interesting trends, resource contention,
etc.

They're current platform is Ubuntu 6.10 (with designs to move to 7.04),
Apache/1.3.34, mod_perl/1.29, and Perl 5.8.8.

This project is should be done in under two weeks. Please submit a fixed
price bid. You should also send a current resume and samples of your
Perl code (CPAN id is fine).

Strong Perl
