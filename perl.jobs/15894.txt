Job title: Senior Perl Developer

Company name: All Around The World

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Want a remote Perl job working for a great company with colleagues from all
around the world? We are looking for four developers, with at least one
having strong front-end skills. 

We do set a high bar on who we employ, so
if joining a bunch of Perl hackers who love the language sounds like fun,
send us your CV and we'll send you our programming test. In return, because
we value your time, Ovid will evaluate the test and will send you feedback
on how you did and areas for improvement, if any. 

Most of our clients are
in Europe and we require developers to be able to provide at least four
hours of overlap with them.

Desired skills:
Perl. Strong Perl. You love the language. This is the only solid
requirement. 

Front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JS, not design) are often very
useful. 

Good communication skills. 

Understanding databases is
important.
