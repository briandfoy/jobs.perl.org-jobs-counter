Location: London, UK

Pay rate: £380pd

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Description:
PTS is working on behalf of a global client based in the City of London.

You will be working on business critical hosting platforms where you will
have the opportunity to own tasks and drive them forward.  The team is made
up of highly skilled Perl developers. Strong Object Orientated Perl is key
for this position as is the ability to know your war around  Solaris,
Redhat or Suse at admin levels.

This is a rolling contract and is a great opportunity for someone looking
to move into contracting from a permanent role.  I've placed many
developers with this client and the feedback from candidates has always
been positive.

OO Perl
Catalyst 
Moose
Template::ToolKit
Unix/Linux System Administration
