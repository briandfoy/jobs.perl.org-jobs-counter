Length of employment: 2+ years

Hours: Full time

Description:
Our large, publicly traded customer has an immediate need for a Developer
will be responsible for developing and maintaining data center

center console/monitoring applications (DC Track, Data Center Expert, etc)

The hiring team prefers candidates with a broad skill-set within open

The three most important skills to this position are as follows:

1. 3+ years of experience in open source development (PHP, Perl, Apache,
Linux)
2. 3+ years of experience with developing databases (ideally MySQL)
3. Self motivation with the flexibility to work Independently as well as in
a team environment 

Why would this be a good role to apply for?

You would be working with a very talented team in one of the largest data

organization that promotes long-term growth, even while on contract.
