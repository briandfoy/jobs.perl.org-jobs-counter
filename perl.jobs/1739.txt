Job title: Mod_Perl Programmer

Company name: Confidential

Location: United States, CA, Livermore

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Hourly employee

Length of employment: 3-6 months temp to hire

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
We are seeking an experienced Perl programmer to help build a
special-purpose web application platform in Apache/modperl, and to
contribute at a senior technical level on related projects.

We use Open Source tools wherever possible, and will release back as much
as possible of our work to the community.



Required skills:
Relevant skills:

System/network administration experience in a Unix-like system, preferably
Linux, at least several years, is required.  BS/CS or equivalent
experience, plus 3+ solid years of Perl programming experience required;
writing quickie scripts for system administration is not
enough.  Understanding and working with complex Perl data structures,
references, regexps, packages, objects, etc. is a basic requirement.  CGI
programming experience is a must, with modperl experience a strong plus. 
Having built a complete, successful application server in modperl, even if
under Apache::Register, would be the best possible qualification for this
position.  Working with Webmin, XS experience, or contributing modules to
CPAN would be advantages.
