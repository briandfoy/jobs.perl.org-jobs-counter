Job title: Software Support Technician

Company name: Plain Black Corporation

Location: United States, WI, Madison

Pay rate: $45k + $16k benefits

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Plain Black (www.plainblack.com) is looking for a Perl programming, Linux
using, ssh connected, GEEK! We're not looking for your run of the mill
technician; only geeks should apply. We want you to know and love
technology. We want you to not only have heard of operating systems other
than Windows, but to use them daily. And most importantly, we want you to
be hungry to learn more every single day. If this sounds like you, continue
reading, else go read some other job descriptions.


On a day to day basis you'll be asked to support our clients using WebGUI
(www.webgui.org). You'll need to be patient, and able to support novice
users all the way to programmers. For this reason you'll have to have a
good amount of Perl programming experience. You must be both self-motivated
and a good communicator. You'll work with technologies such as Perl,
Javascript, MySQL, Apache, and Linux. Be prepared to think on your feet,
plan ahead, and fly by the seat of your pants...it just depends on the day.



Other duties will include light bug fixing, performance tuning, software
installs, and release management. We are a small and rapidly growing
company so everybody does a little of everything. There is plenty of
opportunity to grow into other positions such as research and development,
client services, and project management. 

Required skills:
- Be as patient as the day is long. 
- Be a geek. 
- Be a U.S. Citizen as we do lots of work for the Federal government. 
- Have experience with Perl, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- Have experience with operating systems other than Windows. 
- Have experience with software systems such as MySQL and Apache. 
- Be a great communicator. 
- Be self-motivated. 

Desired skills: Prior experience with WebGUI.
