Job title:
Largest Perl team in London with beautiful Docklands offices

Company name: Perl Jobs by Perl Careers

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Strong

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Large, dynamic Perl team in Canary Wharf looking for mid-level and senior
developers. Run by a Perl-loving CTO in beautiful offices with a great view
over Canary Wharf, the company manages one legacy Perl codebase and a whole
bunch of very new, very shiny, and very modern codebases that power the
market-leading solution in their particular area. Free breakfast, too, for
some values of breakfast.

The company has a number of big-data and data
analysis projects, and have bet heavily on AWS, for everything from
autoscaling to Redshift. They use a variety of Modern Perl technologies
across their projects, with codebases using Mojo, Dancer, DBIx::Class, and
regularly send developers to YAPC.

The company has maintained its small
company feel, despite being bought a few years ago by a much larger
company, and the office is super-friendly and supportive.

Desired skills:
Exposure to AWS helpful but not required. Most projects will require at
least some degree of HTML/Javascript/CSS. Modern Perl a huge plus
