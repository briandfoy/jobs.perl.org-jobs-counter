Subject: Object Oriented Perl Programmer needed ASAP!
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: twarias@thinkpath.com (Trina Warias)

I am looking for a solid Perl Programmer ASAP.  I want someone with Object
Oriented Perl development skills no CGI and No PHP to design very high level
financial applications for a trading(securities) environment.  This company
also works with C++, Sybase and SQL but 80% of the development will be done
in PERL.  Can you help me, I would greatly appreciate any help you might
provide.  Even if you could supply me with questions that could distinguish
how hands on the candidate has been with perl would be very helpful.

Thanks kindly,
