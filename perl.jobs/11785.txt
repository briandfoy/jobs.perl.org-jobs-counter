Company name: TigerLead Solutions

Location: Los Angeles, CA, United States

Pay rate: up to $200K USD

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Company Background
TigerLead Solutions is a leading provider of internet marketing services
and management software to Realtors throughout North America. TigerLead is
a thriving young company offering a cutting-edge set of services to an
enthusiastic and expanding client base. We're seeking a talented and
likable leader to assume a key role within our team of engineers and
spearhead the creation of apps and features that users will love.

Overview of Position
As a Principal Software Engineer, you will be assuming a key leadership
role in the architecture, design, development, and delivery of web
applications for one of the most heavily-trafficked network of real estate
sites on the web. You will assume mentor and guru status in a small,
collaborative environment with both other seasoned pros and talented junior
folks, and you will enjoy the direct support of the company's owners and
CTO. Your canvas and raw materials include rich data sets totaling several
million property listings replenished daily by hundreds of external data
feeds. This valuable data and our powerful end-user tools to access it are
deployed across several thousand real estate search sites used by nearly
two million home-buyer leads and growing by 50K+ users each month. The
prospective home buyer leads using our search tools are in turn tracked and
cultivated by the several thousand real estate professionals using our
management software. This is an outstanding opportunity to see your
creations immediately embraced by a large community of users while you
enjoy working in a stable and positive environment. 

Benefits
We're offering a competitive starting salary with opportunity for growth,
medical benefits, paid holidays and personal days, paid monthly parking or
public transportation pass, a casual work environment with no dress code, a
new high-end workstation with your personal specs, a well-stocked kitchen
with both healthy and not-so-healthy food and beverages, and the
opportunity to work with a talented and committed team of engineers as well
as extremely nice folks in all other areas of the company too.
Participation in the twice-daily Quake sessions is voluntary but highly
encouraged. This is a full-time position in our comfortable offices in West
LA near UCLA and public transportation hubs. We are not able to consider
contractor or telecommuting arrangements at this time, although occasional
work from home could be OK once you are established. Relocation assistance
is negotiable.

An Endorsement
If you're a fan of Perl, then you're probably familiar with Tim Bunce. Tim
has been part of our team for several years and was kind enough to say
"TigerLead is a lovely company to work for and this is a great opportunity.
Highly recommended."

Required skills:
Our ideal candidate would have the following experience and capabilities:

-senior level software engineer (7+ years of industry experience)
-minimum 2+ years of industrial strength Perl development
-significant experience with Ruby or Python, including the use of web
application frameworks
-expert-level SQL skills (PostgreSQL is our preferred flavor)
-strong background in OO architecture and MVC design
-able to architect and implement solutions to complex problems on large,
highly scalable systems
-solid understanding of industry best practices on a range of development
topics and ability to lead dev team in those areas
-a *nix enthusiast with solid history of success in open source web
development
-past experience managing and setting the direction for a large code-base
with Git or Subversion
-experience with an ORM package such as DBIC, ActiveRecord, or Doctrine
-mindful of security concerns and web-based attacks, and how to avoid
common security pitfalls (XSS, SQL injection...)
-enjoys an intellectually vigorous environment and contributes to that
intensity
-strong leadership abilities, enjoys collaborating with and facilitating
the development of others, and a sense of humor
