Job title: Perl developer

Company name: Ryktr

Location: USA

Pay rate: $60/hour

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Got a server feeding data to a mobile app.  Server uses perl to gather
NFL/college football game info & do some data transformations.

Code is written, but need someone to help with minor details that come up,
especially weird data things (such as, client gives us CSV file of a bunch
of changes - we parse & do data updates).

This is sort of an "as needed" type deal.  Not sure how long it will last
-- I'd guess minimally a few months.

Required skills:
Perl (object-oriented), MySQL, Linux (i.e. daemons, etc)

Desired skills: Apache, nginx, node.js, Javascript
