Job title: Remote Perl Web Developer

Company name: Tech Strata

Internal ID: n/a

Location: Brisbane, QLD, Australia

Pay rate: TBD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: multiple projects

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are a fairly young Australian based start-up specializing in IT
security, network administration and open source solutions.

We are looking for an independent and highly self motivated Perl web
developer with great communication skills, to assist us with the design and
implementation of several in-house and customer projects.

Unfortunately as a start-up we donâ€™t have a huge budget for this position,
so we need a candidate that can make the most efficient use of the funds
available, and who can take on additional work as our client base allows.

To give you a little background, the company was founded about 18 months
ago by a couple of Linux geeks with a passion for surfing and building
awesome solutions using open source technology.

We have enjoyed a fairly successful first year and have picked up some
great long term clients, but we appreciate that going forward we need to
enlist the skills of a Perl ninja to help us out with web development
projects.

We try only to take on interesting projects, and we feel very strongly
about giving back to the open source community where ever possible.

Required skills:
* Dancer or Mojolicious (we prefer Dancer but we are open to negotiation)
* Security (hugely important to us)
* jQuery (Open to other JS frameworks here)
* HTML5 and CSS (We don't expect a graphics wizard, but your interfaces
should look clean and appealing)
*MySQL
* Linux
* Git

Desired skills:
Bonus points if you know your way around LDAP, oauth2 or CAS.

Extra bonus points if you know about Nginx and Varnish

Super extra bonus points if you also speak Java or Ruby
