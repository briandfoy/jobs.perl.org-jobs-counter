Job title: Perl Developer and IT Specialist

Company name: prayerletters.com

Location: New Hampshire, United States

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
prayerletters.com is the leading online platform for sending printed prayer
letters. Working here gives you an unparalleled view of missions around the
world, along with the opportunity to provide a much-appreciated service to
missionaries.

We're looking to hire a combination programmer and IT person
to build and improve our ministry communication services and associated
infrastructure.

RESPONSIBILITIES

As a programmer at prayerletters.com,
you'll create, maintain, and improve software that helps missionaries grow
and keep in touch with their support base, multiplying their time for
ministry activities.

As an IT person at prayerletters.com, you'll deploy,
automate, and monitor servers on our on-site and off-site clouds to ensure
that our services are reliable, responsive, and secure.

Your contributions
will help over a thousand missionaries be more effective as we help them
stay focused on their field of ministry rather than being distracted by
administrative and financial details.

ENVIRONMENT

prayerletters.com is a
small business located in New Hampshire with four full-time employees.
Steve, the founder, is a software developer with over 25 years of
experience running online services (primarily this one).

Our goal is for
this position to take on most of the programming and IT aspects of Steve's
role so that he can focus on running the business as a whole.

The code
that runs our services has been under continual, iterative development
since 2003. We fix bugs as they appear and refactor/modernize existing code
while we write new code. This, combined with extensive logging, decent
testing, and automated deployment means that it's relatively stable and
easy to maintain.

Our software runs primarily on Perl, Javascript,
PostgreSQL, and Linux. Our IT infrastructure is currently powered by
Ansible, Proxmox, AWS (primarily EC2, RDS, and S3), Icinga, Jenkins, and
Splunk, among others.

Desired skills:
We'll prefer a candidate with significant experience writing modern Perl.

You should be a perfectionist with strong troubleshooting skills and a love
for systems and automation.

You should have strong written English skills.

You should have some familiarity with most of the technologies listed in
the previous section.

You should have prior experience working with at
least one web framework in your preferred programming language.

Your
working schedule should have two or more hours of overlap at least twice
per week with our normal business hours of Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (US
Eastern).

You are either located and have a legal right to work in the
United States or you're located outside the United States and we can figure
out how to pay you in a way that doesn't create an undue burden on our
company.

Prior experience working with missionaries, religious ministries,
or comparable non-profit agencies will be helpful, but is not strictly
required.
