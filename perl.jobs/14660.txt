Job title: Senior Software Engineer

Company name: Chargesmart

Location: San Francisco, CA, Vancouver, BC or remote

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Chargesmart.com is a rapidly expanding bill payment website with an
established user base and thousands of payments processed daily.  We
launched a completely redesigned and modernized frontend/backend last year,
and we’re seeking an experienced full stack web engineer to support and
expand the site post-launch.  Our mission is to make the bill payment
experience as frictionless as possible, and to that end we value people
that are fanatical about end-user experience.  

Chargesmart.com provides an easy to use bill payment platform with over
3000 of the nation’s most popular billers.  We market direct to consumers
through our chargesmart.com website, and we also provide a white-label
platform that partners can use to integrate bill payments into their
applications.  

Chargesmart is headquartered in San Francisco, CA in the SoMa district with
easy access to BART.  As part of Tio Networks, we also have an office  in
Vancouver, BC.	Local San Francisco applicants are preferred, but we will
also consider remote applicants with demonstrable telecommuting experience.

Required skills:
We’re a small team and you’ll have a chance to work on a bit of everything.
 Our backend is a perl Dancer app that interacts with the frontend via our
RESTful API.  The frontend is almost entirely implemented with backbone.js
and bootstrap. Behind all of that, we have integrations to various payment
processors to settle and remit funds (all perl).  

Our ideal candidate has:

•	Strong JS skills and has built web apps using backbone.js or
another JS framework.  
•	modern OO perl experience (or experience with another modern
scripting language like ruby or python and is willing to learn)
•	Has worked with dancer or another mvc framework (rails, flask, etc)

•	Used bootstrap and can explain why responsive design is important. 

•	Solid MySQL experience, plus familiarity with postgres.

Desired skills:
It’d be great if you also have: 

•	Experience in the payments industry
•	Sysadmin experience.  We manage our own infrastructure, and
familiarity with nginx, spacewalk, memcached, basic networking principles,
backups, etc are always helpful to have.
•	An interest or experience with risk analytics.	We’re constantly
improving our risk algorithms to reduce fraudulent transactions.
