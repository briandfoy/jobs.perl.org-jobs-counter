      Proficient in Perl for both mod_perl application interface
development and backend data-processing. 
      Ability to maintain our servers (running Linux using the Apache
webserver) as well as provision new servers (you must have experience
administering servers, changing hosting companies, migrating from one
server to another, etc). 
      Experienced in HTML, Javascript, Perl, PHP, MySQL, DNS, Apache
Servers and Unix -- systems administration experience required. 
      Email processing and experience with qmail highly preferred. 


Desired skills:
      Creative approach to problem solving and can-do attitude. 
      Ability to check and troubleshoot your own work is critical. 
      Ability to interface directly with non-technical end-users. 
      Self-starter and can work independently while managing your resources
