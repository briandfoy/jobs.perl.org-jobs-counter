Job title:
Assistant Perl developer for online travel company

Company name: Skoosh

Location: United Kingdom, Brighton

Pay rate: $20ph

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Skoosh has been established for 8 years and is a fast growing B2C site for
booking hotel accommodation. We compete head to head with the biggest
players in our industry. This is a particularly exciting time as our brand
is beginning to flourish.

We require one more developer for an ongoing project to extend our current
software. As our existing team is based in Russia, our preference would be
for more Russian developers but surrounding countries would also be fine.

Successful applicants should have experience in building and extending
large web applications written in Perl as well as having advanced level
knowledge of English, MySQL and Javascript.

Training on our system can take 2-3 months so any applicants should be
prepared to work for a year or longer.

To apply, please send a CV and cover letter, including a description of
similar projects you've worked on, to the contact information below.


Required skills:
English, Perl, MySQL and Javascript knowledge.
