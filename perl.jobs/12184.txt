Job title: Perl Developer - all levels

Company name: NYC Software firm

Internal ID: JH Perl001

Location: New York, NY, USA

Pay rate: open

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
We get to build a lot of really cool systems at scale, including search,
download, content organization, real-time metrics, deployment, and other
stuff that we can't tell you about yet. Our current systems are mostly
built around Perl, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, Solr, Apache, Nginx, and MySQL.
We are seeking experienced and intelligent software engineers that are
excited about working with other experienced and intelligent software
engineers on closely integrated teams to push the boundaries of what is
expected of a stock photo company. 
We focus on fast, iterative development (over 150 deployments/month) and
collaborative, interactive programming. Developers work on small
cross-functional teams (4-6 people) that have a voice in setting their own
priorities and are expected to build and deploy applications quickly and
iteratively.

Required skills:
Qualified candidates are:

·	  in love with programming and building things that have never
existed

·	  curious and passionate about finding creative solutions to
complex problems

·	  able communicators that are used to talking through problems and
feel a deep need to share the cool stuff that they're working on with
others

·	  experienced enough to know what to build themselves and what not
to

·	  aware of what they don't know yet and are excited about what to
learn next

·	  ready to teach us some new tricks

·	  able to take care of business

 

Skills Required

·	  a very deep understanding of at least one programming language
(Perl strongly preferred, but we're not zealots)

·	  years of experience with at least one database (MySQL preferably)


·	  a profound knowledge of how the web works and how to make it
efficient (HTTP, caching, page rendering, etc)

·	  strong linux experience.

Desired skills:
Skills Preferred

·	  HTML::Mason

·	  Experience with web MVC frameworks: Dancer, Mojolicious,
Catalyst, Sinatra, Express, etc

·	  RESTful API design and development

·	  Layout / Design

·	  Front or back end javascript / Node.js

·	  Image processing and computer vision

·	  MongoDB or other key/value stores

·	  Memcached / Redis

·	  System administration

·	  MogileFS
