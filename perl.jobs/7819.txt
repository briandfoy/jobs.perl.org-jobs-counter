Job title: Senior Web Application Developer

Company name: IntelliSurvey, Inc.

Internal ID: C25

Location: United States, CA, Ladera Ranch

Pay rate: $80K - $110K DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
IntelliSurvey, Inc. is a young and growing (but also financially stable)
company, and we need to hire great software developers to help us grow. 
Our software enables market researchers to deploy complex online surveys,
and view results using real-time on-line reports.  We license our software
via an ASP model for our do-it-yourself clients, and we also have client
service project managers who use our software internally for clients who
who would rather outsource all survey set up.  

We are currently adding major new features to our software to allow us to
stay ahead of the competition. So this is a great opportunity for the right
candidate to be a part of building leading-edge software using the latest
web development technologies.  You will be involved in all phases of
software development, from high level design, detailed design, to
programming, testing, and roll-out.

Our programming is done using database-backed and object-oriented
programming, with tools such as Perl on the server and using JavaScript
(with the YUI library and Ajax) for the front-end.

Depending on your background and experience, you may also be responsible
for helping to monitor and manage our servers, and for occasionally
providing technical support to our clients.

Required skills:
Our core software is built using Perl, mod_perl, DBI, and Apache running on
Linux servers, with PostgreSQL databases.  Our new software version also
includes dynamic pages using extensive javascript and ajax.  Our ideal
candidate will be experienced in developing web applications using these
tools and technologies. In addition, the  candidate should be comfortable
with configuring hardware (for example, installing all necessary software
on a new Linux server) and should have a significant amount of networking
expertise.

However, we are happy to consider excellent programmers regardless of their
technology background.	The ability to learn quickly and adapt is more
important than past experience with any particular technical skill.

Finally, because we are a relatively small company, everyone may be asked
to wear different hats and help with whatever other tasks are necessary to
help the company grow and prosper.
