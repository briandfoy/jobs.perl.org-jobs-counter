Rent.com is a leader in its industry and we are looking for someone who is
going to significantly contribute to both our team and its product.  The

Experience with advanced Perl in any field is required, and a knowledge of

will be important.  We are looking for someone who understands that Perl is
a serious very high level programming language used in large, complex, high

Experience with Windows will not be held against you, but development at
Rent.com is performed exclusively on Linux. You should be at home on Linux,
BSD, or Unix variants.

Rent.com helps millions of renters search for apartments and other rental
properties, and is the only national service to give renters $100 when they
find an apartment through our web site and report the lease.  The right
candidate will help us add new features to our existing platform and
develop brand new categories of service.

Every project you complete will make a significant difference at this
young, exciting company and you will be rewarded with our success. 

Benefits include: medical (PPO/HMO), dental, stock options, 401k matching,
vacation, casual atmosphere, flexible hours, parties, etc.


Required skills:
You must be an expert at Perl and Linux/Unix.  You must be proficient with
SQL (Oracle/mySQL/PostgreSQL), web technologies including HTTP/HTML/XML,
and object oriented design and development.  You should also have
experience with high level language like Java, C/C++.  You must be able to
speak your mind and communicate well with other tech types.

Desired skills:
Apache, mod_perl, Mason, Template Toolkit, Javascript,
CSS, sense of humor.
