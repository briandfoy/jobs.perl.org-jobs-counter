Description:
Yes, that title is correct. This client is looking for the top 1% of all
Perl hackers. I have placed three developers there and know the group
very well. They are the pickiest place I have yet to recruit for.

The work is on site in New York City with a small team of some of the
best Perl developers in the world. The project is a pure Perl
distributed and parallel system to build large C++ applications on
multiple platforms (all UNIX flavors). This system is live and needs
ongoing improvements and fixes.

This client pays generous salaries, full benefits and annual bonuses
(they have not been affected by the current downturn). There is also an
opportunity for a contract temp-to-perm arrangement.


Required skills:
Very strong Perl
Complex data structures
Communications and control
Parallel and distributed processing

Desired skills:
gcc
C/C++
ld
