Job title:
Developer/Senior Developer for Small Consulting Firm

Company name: Infinity Interactive, Inc.

Location: United States, NY, New York

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
We are looking for a senior level developer to help us re-architect and
build a core system for our primary client.

We are a small consulting company primarily based in the New York tri-state
area. We are a totally virtual company, so this is telecommuting position.
We would prefer local (NY, CT, NJ) applicants (however, this is not a hard
requirement so don't let it discourage you from applying).

We primarily use Open Source software, which allows us to build affordable
solutions for our clients. We also believe in giving back, so we encourage
our employees to get involved with Open Source software development
themselves.

Required skills:
Skills you must have:

- Object Oriented Perl

Perl is our primary language, and OO is our primary development
methodology, so strong OO Perl skills are required. In addition, you
*must* know your way around the CPAN (if you are not already a module
author, you will be after you are hired). Some of the modules we use
heavily are; DBI, Template Toolkit, Catalyst, DBIx::Class,
CGI::Application, YAML, Moose, Excel::Template, pdflib and GD.

We are very focused on code re-usability, so if there is a chance we might
use code again (and there almost certainly is) we spend the time to
modularize it and build it "right". We also big on maintainability, since
we tend to need to maintain code over long periods of time.

- Apache, mod_perl and MySQL

This is our current platform of choice (more specifically, Apache 2,
mod_perl 2 and MySQL 5) but it may not stay that way. However, we will
still need to maintain existing apps written on it, so knowledge of it is
required. But experience with other platforms is a big plus.

- HTML, Javascript and CSS

Most programmers hate HTML, think Javascript is tedious and CSS is just for
designers. We don't think that way, if the front-end doesn't look good, no
one cares how elegant your back-end code is. We have front-end
(HTML/CSS/JS) specialists on staff, but you do have to be comfortable
making changes.

- Self Management Skills

This is a key skill, and one which you *must* have. Because we are virtual,
no one will be looking over your shoulder all day. Because we are a small
team, we will need you to be able to take ownership of your projects and be
completely responsible for your work. In return for you taking on this
responsibility, we will give you a wide range of flexibility (as long as
the job gets done and done right).

Desired skills:
Skill we really would like you to have:

- Experience in multiple programming languages and paradigms

While Perl is one of our primary languages, it is not always the right tool
for the job. You should be comfortable with other languages (HTML &
Client-side Javascript don't count), and comfortable with jumping in and
learning new languages and paradigms.

Specifically, we are big fans of functional programming (Haskell,
LISP/Scheme, ML/OCaml, etc.), and while we primarily use OO in practice,
the ideas of functional programming inform much of our design philosophy.
Experience in one or more functional languages is a big plus, and the words
"Lambda Calculus" should not frighten you.

- Web Services, SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

Just because it's a hot buzzword, doesn't mean it's a bad idea.  
Services are just another level of modularity, and one which we are
exploring.

- Client Skills

The ability to interact with the clients in a professional manner is a big
plus. Project management skills are good too.
