Job title: Perl CGI/Mysql Linux  for active website

Company name: BargainPHV.com

Internal ID: 1

Location: United Kingdom, London

Pay rate: £200 budget

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 3/5 days

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: yes

Description:
Need to expand my current website to incorporate a 30day subscription
service for customers with the first 30days free. I also need to add an
additional 30day subscription service for suppliers again with the first
30days free. Using email address with possibly recapture as registration
tool. 

The website is mainly CGI/Perl with a Mysql db on a Linux server.

There will be two new interactive pages one for the customer and the other
for the supplier. Both pages are to have Instant Messenger interacted with
an interactive window or something similar; I have excel ss to demonstrate.


The start of this process is for the registered customer to make a request
from a selection already written in perl. When request is sent all the
registered suppliers will receive an email/notification that a customer has
made a request. 

Supplier(s) must login and decide if they can accommodate the customer. If
so they have press TALK in the Interactive Window to engage in a
conversation through the IM facility.

In summary I’m at looking at 4/5pages to be written with some 30/40% of
Perl/CGI and the Mysql db already in place.
