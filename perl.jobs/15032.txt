Pay rate: £350 - £400 Per Day

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 6 Months

Description:
My client are looking for a contractor on a 6 month basis.
You will be engaged to work on a new codebase, and helping to create
another, so there is good and tangible opportunity to influence the
technologies my client are using. The role will also see you responsible
for the architecture of the resulting products.
Their existing codebase is built on DBIx::Class and Dancer on Plack, has a
reasonable test-suite, is deployable via Jenkins, and the Product Owner is
nearby (infact only a couple of seats away..). The new codebase is a series
of API integrations, and you'll be working with their developers helping to
plan and implementing their solutions.

Required skills:
Strong knowledge of the following is preferred
Perl 
DBIx::Class
Dancer on Plack
