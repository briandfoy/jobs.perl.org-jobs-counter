Job title: LAMP Developer

Company name: School Loans Corp

Internal ID: sw1

Location: United States, CA, San Carlos

Pay rate: $50-60k/year + bonus

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Description:
School Loans Corporation provides fully outsourced private-label student
lending solutions to financial institutions and secondary markets. Using
primarily open source tools, we've built systems for capturing, processing
and storing loan applications for FFELP and private loans. 

We are looking for two programmers to join our development team, developing
software for our internal and external customers as well as building and
maintaining XML data feeds with our partners.  

Salary and benefits for this position will depend on experience, but will
be competitive for an engineer with 2-4 years experience (if you have a
PhD, you should probably think twice before responding). We offer standard
health benefits, 401k, and are an equal opportunity employer.

Required skills:
You'll need at a minimum the following skills:

- Great OO Perl Skills: You MUST be very comfortable using perl objects,
have experience rolling complex data structures, writing custom modules,
searching CPAN, connecting to a mysql database, etc.

- Strong Linux Skills: You don't need to be able to re-compile the kernel,
but you need to be completely comfortable in a bash shell.

- Good Experience with XML: You should have experience with parsing and
generating XML using perl.

- Strong Apache Skills: You should be familiar with setting up and
configuring apache, setting redirects and rewrites, installing a
certificate, etc.

- Great People Skills: You'll interface with our internal marketing and
project management staff as well as with our partners, so you should have
excellent verbal and written communication skills.


Desired skills:
Other skills that would be considered a plus:
- Experience with Siebel CRM API's
- Experience with commercial OCR
- Experience with SOAP
