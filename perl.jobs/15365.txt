Job title: automated mobile app API feed classification

Company name: Synthima

Location: telecommute (company based in Northern Virginia)

Pay rate: DOE

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Note: This could be a full time with benefits, part time (hourly or
salaried), or hourly contract (1099) position. For employees, we are open
to anybody legally able to work in the USA. The team is mostly full time
employees today, but if you are overseas we would be happy to work with you
if you can legally take payments from the USA (and handle local taxes,
etc.). 

We are doing work looking at mobile apps and websites for our
clients.

To do this, we have built a framework in Perl to network to
automate operation of various headless browsers, capture and analyze
traffic, and attempt to automatically grok network traffic between apps and
servers, etc.

The data we're working with is frequently JSON, XML, or
straight HTML. It can be compressed or encoded in a number of ways. It can
be in a number of languages including Asian (so, understanding what things
matter when using unicode in a database query via Perl is important...).

We try to automatically detect and work with a variety of data sources,
looking for [the thing that it is we're looking for]. 

Our environment is
made up of Debian Linux, lots of kvm virtualization, MySQL / MariaDB. Perl
glues things together.

The team is geographically distributed, mostly
based in the USA. We coordinate using chat, git, video and voice
conferencing.

Desired skills:
Reasonable grasp of:
 
- Perl network programming
   - retrieval of web
content (using LWP::UserAgent underneath some wrappers we have made)
   -
TCP / UDP sockets (server and client), sometimes including TLS / SSL
sockets
- Perl database access (especially MySQL / MariaDB)
- Perl IPC (as
experienced in a Linux environment) 
   - for the sake of parallel
processing moderately large (but not huge) chunks of data. 
   - for the
sake of controlling other programs (some non-Perl)

- Knowledge of how
modern web / mobile apps typically talk to their APIs.

Non-Perl skills
that would be useful:

- web or mobile app security / analysis / coding
background, OR
- example experience using mitmproxy, burpsuite, etc.
-
LAMP-type stuff (we present the data we automatically collect via a web
dashboard)
