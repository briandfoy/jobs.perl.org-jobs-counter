Job title: Frontend Perl Developer

Company name: Ascent Sourcing

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: Competitive

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
My client is looking for one or more talented developers who can help us
take their award-winning and highly popular website to the next level.

They will be exceedingly talented and agile individuals, who will
participate in designing and building database-driven websites on Linux
(Debian) from end-to-end; in programming the back-end in object-oriented
fashion, and building aesthetically pleasing front-end user interfaces
using XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax and jQuery. Ideally, they can write neat
copy and manipulate images, too. Experience with administering Linux
servers is a plus.

New recruits will have a degree from a top university, preferably in
computing science or mathematics, and/or equivalent work experience, and an
explorer mentality. They will complement a strong IT team, based at smart
offices in West London. Since some members of the team work remotely, the
people they’re looking for will be comfortable discussing not only their
progress but also their project development strategy over the telephone and
IM, as well as face-to-face.

This is a wide-ranging role, with plenty of variety, and an excellent
opportunity for the right person to influence the way forward for one of
the UK’s favourite xxx websites.

Required skills:
Strong OO skills (in e.g. PHP, C++, Java, or, ideally, Perl), XHTML,
JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), MySQL

Desired skills:
Photoshop/GIMP, an eye for design, C/C++, Apache2, HTTP, OpenVPN, Bind/DNS,
Amazon S3/EC2/CloudFront, TCP/IP socket programming
