Job title: mod_perl/DBI hacker for web apps

Company name: TigerLead

Internal ID: tigerlead

Location: United States, CA, Los Angeles

Pay rate: $75k - $100k+

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: indefinite

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Does this make sense to you?

my @sorted = map( $_->{id}, sort { $a->{name} cmp $b->{name} }
@$some_data );

If so, please continue.

Our best-in-class web based app leverages internet advertising for
targeted leaded acquisition in a tough business vertical. Like every
potential employer, we are looking for coders who live to code and who
love the open source tools they use. What sets us apart is the
phenomenal growth rate we've achieved with a tight, small team in a
depressed business environment and the fact that a lead coder is also a
founding partner. Our tools of choice include postgresql, perl and ruby,
running on virtualized servers and glued together via asynchronous
queues. We don't do java, c++, mysql and python but there's nothing
stopping us if it made sense. When good ideas are hatched, we get
straight to implementation, testing and release, with quantifiable
business success being realized as quickly as we can run the numbers.

Required skills:
Preferred candidates will have a strong grasp of object oriented design,
relational data models and a background in writing modular and
maintainable code. Proven knowledge of CPC advertising quirks,
multi-dimensional performance analysis, full text search or an active
CPAN account will get you in the door immediately.

We are looking for candidates who can make a full-time commitment but a
part-time role may be possible. Compensation is competitive and
negotiable -- the wide salary range advertised is intended to allow for
candidates with a variety of experience levels.
