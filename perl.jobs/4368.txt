Experienced Perl programmer 


You must have either Oracle or MySQL or Postgresql experience. Informix is
a plus.
Thorough command of the English language required with good technical
writing skills creating documentation for users and programmers.

This is for a systems administration group. A background in UNIX/Solaris as
a Perl developer is mandatory; some systems administration background is
helpful.

Initially, this is a maintenance programming position.
Some new work later down the line is likely.

This job is on-site in downtown Brooklyn near many subway lines and the
Flatbush Ave. LIRR station. Bicycle parking is available nearby in the form
of several outdoor racks.  If you insist on driving your car, several
parking garages are available in the area.

The position is 35 hours/week. Flexible hours are available for e.g.
sabbath observance.

Equal Opportunity Employer: anyone with the skills required and the right
to work in the US is encouraged to apply we have a diverse ethnic mix.


Required skills:
*DBI
*CGI
*POD
*HTML/CSS
*SQL
*Apache
*UNIX developer(Solaris a plus but Linux/*BSD/AIX/HP-UX will do)
*Object Oriented Perl including OOA/OOD/OOP
*Perl module packaging (Module::Build)
One or more RDBMS (in order of preference): Oracle, MySQL, Postgresql,
Informix
*RCS/CVS/SCCS/Subversion (any one or more of these)
*regular expresions in Perl
*make (dmake,gmake, make -- any) and makefiles

Desired skills:
*Filenet is nice to have
*Veritas, particularly NetBackup, scripting and logfile analysis is
potentially useful down the road
*Solaris systems administration -- the more UNIX admin experience of any
kind the better as we build and improve tools to automate and monitor our
systems.
*
