Job title: Mid-level Perl Hacker

Company name: Best Practical Solutions

Internal ID: #h4xx0r

Location: United States, MA, Somerville

Pay rate: DOE

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: some

Description:
ABOUT THE JOB

We're looking for a mid-level Perl Hacker to help us enhance and refine RT,
Jifty, and our Next Big Thing. You'll be responsible for everything from
implementing new features across all our products to testing and applying
user-contributed patches to our released software. In a typical week,
you'll probably spend about half your time working on customer projects and
half working on internal and opensource projects.

The hours are flexible and we all telecommute some of the time...though
we're just about to move into new office space in the heart of Davis Sq,
Somerville. We do just about EVERYTHING online and on the phone. You should
be comfortable using email and instant messaging systems to collaborate and
get work done. This job doesn't formally require your full-time presence in
Boston, though it would certainly be an advantage.


Required skills:
ABOUT YOU

You should be a self-starter who has some experience with Perl, as well as
at least a few of the following:

* Test driven development
* User interface design
* HTML::Mason templating
* Documentation
* Web Services
* Cascading Style Sheets
* Javascript / AJAX
* SQL databases
* MVC frameworks
* Optimization and Profiling
* Subversion and SVK


It's ok if you don't know everything out of the gate, but you should be
able to learn on the fly and be comfortable asking questions when you get
in over your head. RT is a large codebase to dive into (47000 lines of
libraries, 27000 of templates) so you should be prepared to work with a
project that's too big to hold in your head at once. If you want to see
what sort of trouble you're getting yourself into, download a copy of RT's
source code from:

http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt.tar.gz


We're a small company and the boss is typically overextended. You should be
comfortable working independently or in small teams, prioritizing tasks on
your own, and juggling tasks and projects. You need to be able to tell when
you're out of your depth and ask for help.


Desired skills:
Compensation

DOE - This is a full-time salaried position, but the details are
negotiable. We're a small, self funded company. The standard benefits
apply, of course: health insurance, dental insurance and junk food to make
that dental insurance worthwhile.
