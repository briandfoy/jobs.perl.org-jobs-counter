Job title: Perl/Linux/Web Software Developer

Company name: TAG Online, Inc.

Location: Clifton, NJ, United States

$40K to $70K in USD.

Description:

Successful candidates will be involved in the full cycle of development of
custom and customized web applications for TAG Online's clients. The

Clients occasionally need help with potentially obscure problems that their
local ISPs can not or will not handle. This can involve some in-depth
digging through log files, testing of local and distant networks and
various other forms of research as a part of the process, and the ability
to solve these puzzles is important to the job. A love of puzzles is a
definite plus.

expression of yourself, this is an excellent opportunity. We're a great
company and we are looking for people to become part of our team.
