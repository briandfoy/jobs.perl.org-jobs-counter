Job title: Perl Developer

Company name: Eligo Recruitment

Location: London, UK

Pay rate: =C2=A350k to =C2=A360k

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Perl Developer / a Perl Guru / Perl Architect=20

So without just dropping
Keyword bombs left right and centre I=E2=80=99m looking for a Perl Develope=
r for
one of the famous Perl house and I will make it obscure so you have to
phone me to find out who it is as I know on IRC people play the guess the
company game.=20=20

Is this you?

Do you love Perl?

Do you hate legacy Perl
code and keen to update it ?

Do you also enjoy getting your hands dirty
with JavaScript?=20=20

So you wear combats and a heavy metal t-shirt ?

If you
have answered Yes , Yes , Yes , Yes (Although the last one isn=E2=80=99t a
requirement but is how most dev=E2=80=99s in the team dress)=20

Tech Stack

They are
going to love you if you have exposure to a framework they use Dancer but
they will still love you if you have experience with Catalyst or
Mojolicious, but being honest they are looking for the =E2=80=9CFront-End=
=E2=80=9D Perl
focussed developer, yes the unicorn that is a Full stack developer. I would
jump for joy,  when you send me your CV and you show me you that have
experience with Perl (With frameworks) and AngularJS (or another JS
framework).

Culture=20

Team environment, so it=E2=80=99s broken into small teams
with hand off management style, as you=E2=80=99re a senior Perl Developer  =
and have
been doing this a while =E2=80=93 They will let you get on with it.

The CTO tends
to take a backseat and look at things more strategically allowing the Dev=
=E2=80=99s
more control.

Let=E2=80=99s do a breakdown

Perl Developer
JavaScript Experience
But to be honest a large factor is going to be how much beer (or Wine) you
can drink =E2=80=93 if you love being in the pub and I guess coding too.  I=
f you
love the Perl community and care about how you=E2=80=99re code looks, and I=
f you
can keep your head when all around you have lost theirs (OK stole that
line) but I need an experienced Dev who will be calm under pressure.


Please also note due to my poor spelling there is bound to be a number of
mistake show how much attention to detail you have if you pick up on them,
and if you get the right amount there will be a beer waiting at the next
London PM meet for you.
