Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Job ref: OSC220
Location: Central London
Salary: Very good

I attend a lot
of Perl conferences and it=E2=80=99s always interesting to see which employ=
ers are
well-represented with a lot of delegates and which employers have little or
no presence. This company is up there among the most prominently
represented at a number of the European conferences, and shows a real
commitment to staying at the cutting edge of Perl. In-house, the focus on
training and development continues with a strong mentorship programme =E2=
=80=93 a
large number of their Senior Developers started there in Junior roles.

They are looking for Mid/Senior-level developers to join their large,
forward-thinking team in London. The right candidate will have experience
with Modern Perl technologies such as Mojolicious, Dancer, or DBIx::Class
and be keen to stay at the forefront of emerging Perl technologies. And,
remember =E2=80=93 this role may be your ticket to enjoying The Perl Confer=
ence
next year without spending a penny of your own money*!

* Results not
guaranteed.

Desired skills:
Perl, of course. Experience with the modern technologies and frameworks
such as Mojo, Dancer or DBIx::Class would be a strong advantage.
