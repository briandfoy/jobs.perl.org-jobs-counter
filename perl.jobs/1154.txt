Description:
A small insurance company is seeking an all-around IT professional with

* Must have excellent communication skills and professional demeanor.
* Strong Perl programming skill; at least 2 years of experience ideal.
* Basic UNIX systems administration experience; RedHat Linux ideal.
* Understanding of good database design principles.

Desired skills:
* Technical support experience on Windows PCs.
* Basic knowledge of networking principles.
* Knowledge of object-oriented design and the ability to implement it in
Perl.
* Demonstrated experience working with Class::DBI and HTML::Mason.
* Demonstrated experience using and administering MySQL.
* Understanding of version management using CVS.
* Web design skill; familiarity with accessibility and design standards.
* Knowledge of the insurance industry.
