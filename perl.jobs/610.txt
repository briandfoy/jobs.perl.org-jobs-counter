Job title:
Perl/CGI Web Dev - Freelance Job - Bids take till 10/18/02

Company name: Triad Holding LCC

Location: United States, IL, Chicago

Pay rate: Open

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 15 Days

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We are currently in the final stages of developing a web site and have 6
pages that need to either update or display dynamic data.  We have a
Database Administrator that will write the scripts to pass the needed data
to and from the tables.  We need someone to write the display to the web
site and / or capture data and pass it to the scripts that will update the
tables.  We would like to be consistent and have the code written in
Perl/CGI.

One of the trickier aspects will be working with pages that display lists
that could be thousands of items.  We are looking for someone that can
suggest efficient methods of doing this.  An example would be a list of all
members that displays contact information. There may be 3 people on the
list or 3,000.

We will also like to be able to sort the list so that if I have a large
list I might only want to see the people that joined recently (or in the
last month / 2 weeks / etc.). 
{This could be a simple parameter passed into the stored procedure that
attaches itself to the query.}

We are developing this project on a Windows 2000 Server, SQL Server 2000,
ActiveState Perl, and IIS.


Required skills:
Requirements:
1 – Must be able to provide references.
2 – Must be able to supply sample of structured code.
3 – Must have enough experience to take what we give you and run with it. 
The ability to make suggestions (or improvements) to the overall process.
4 – Must be available for consultation in the evenings and or weekends (the
key players have full-time gigs and are working on this project on off
hours).
5 – All 6 pages need to be completed in no more than 15 business days.
6 – Must be able to work within the stated environment.  Familiar with
Windows, etc.
7 – Must communicate clearly via Email.  And check Email regularly.
8 – Won’t mind using Yahoo IM for online conversations, etc.
9 – Must be able to telecommute.  Meaning, you must be able to work
remotely and have the resources to get the work accomplished (which
includes the software).
10 – Must be W9 eligible.
