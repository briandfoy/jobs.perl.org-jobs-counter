Job title:
Looking For A Perl Wizard Who Can Work On Own! (Remote Position)

Location: United States, CO, Denver

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Hi everyone!

We are looking for a Perl (or Python) wizard to lead the development of the
backend and architecture of a fairly complex application. This is a new
project and the only people involved at this point are myself and the other
owner of the company. You would be building the guts of this and you need
to be good and able to work on your own. 

Our companies previous project is profitable and has 40+ employees spread
out around the world. I say that as we have a good track record, we are
self financed, and not full of shit :) (which is always nice). 

You need to have:
- Mastery of Perl or Python.
- Some understanding of linux systems, aka system admin knowledge such as
permissions.
- Understanding of scripts like WordPress and Drupal, how they work, what
they are for, etc.
- Understanding of web concepts like FTP, firewalls, etc (Duh!)
- The ability to learn and solve complex problems.
- Bonus if you have experience designing an API and an application that is
designed to scale from the start.
- An understanding of consumer's technical abilities would be helpful. 
- Must be responsible and self motivated. 

This position is a full time position and salary will be reflective of your
skill and background. We are based in Denver but all our employees work
remote and we like the flexibility it offers. We are extremely flexible on
hours and if you have a family you will find us a great fit. 

Please email me at bwb@bweeb.com, I am looking for the following items in
your email:
- Your background in your own words (not too many please).
- What you have been working on, and especially in your free time if you
have any.
- What you know about WordPress or any other scripts and experience with
those.
- Previous projects you built by yourself, or with a small team and what
you loved about those.
- Salary Requirements and a formal resume showing a list of past positions.


And on a personal note, if you are passionate about the internet, websites,
and building something that has the opportunity to create a lot of jobs for
people around the world you are going to love this project. 

I look forward to hearing from you, once again my email is bwb@bweeb.com,
Thanks, Ben 

PS. Please no recruiters and currently we are only looking inside the USA
or Canada for this position.
