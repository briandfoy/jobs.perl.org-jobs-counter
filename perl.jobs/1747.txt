Job title:
Web Programmer for Mason-based e-commerce site

Internal ID: Perl-Job-01

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
One of my clients needs to get some work done sooner than I can do it, so I
am looking for another programmer to help.  You will be doing the bulk of
the work, with guidance and review from me.

One of the most important pieces of work is integration with the Amazon
Seller system, so previous experience doing this would be a huge plus.

The work needs to be done in the near future (starting within the next
month or so), so you need to be available soon.

This is a telecommuting position.

This will be contract work directly for my client, and you will discuss the
rate with him.	I am just screening applicants for those with the best
technical resume.  Don't ask me about rates.


Required skills:
- OO Perl
- Some Perl templating system
- SQL


Desired skills:
- Mason
- Postgres
- *Amazon Seller integration experience*

Contact information:
Contact Dave Rolsky at dave {AT} houseabsolute.com

Please include "Perl-Job-01" in the subject line.

Please include a *link* to your resume.  Respondents who don't do this will
be ignored.  Don't send me attachments, don't inline it.

If you have experience with Amazon Seller integration, Mason, and/or
Postgres, please briefly mention this in your email.
