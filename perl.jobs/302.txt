just a friendly reminder, please DO NOT reply directly to this list. we
have had a few of those recently and i want to get it stopped before it
gets very bad. always write a fresh email to the address listed in any
job/wanted posting and don't hit reply. or if you do want to use reply
so you can quote nicely, please remember to delete this list from the
address headers.
