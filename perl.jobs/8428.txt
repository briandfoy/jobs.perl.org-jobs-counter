Job title:
Perl OpenSocial (MySpace and Plaxo) contract

Company name: Lacerte Development

Location: Canada, BC, Victoria

Pay rate: $500 CAD/USD

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Length of employment: 2 weeks

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We need to extract contacts and calendar events from MySpace and Plaxo into
our Perl driven Web service. We'll also want to export the same from our
service back out to MySpace and Plaxo. It appears we'll need a Perl module
that talks to the OpenSocial REST API to perform the transfer of this
information and that this module could support both MySpace and Plaxo since
they seem to both use the OpenSocial API.

Required skills: Perl, perhaps some JavaScript

Desired skills: OpenSocial, MySpace, Plaxo
