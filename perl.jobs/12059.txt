Job title: Perl Software Developer for PeopleSeePeople

Company name: PeopleSeePeople

Location: Brooklyn, NY, USA

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
We recently finished the beta version of our new service called
PeopleSeePeople.

PeopleSeePeople helps people understand themselves and one another better.

The basic functionality of the service is to rate other people’s pictures
and to have your picture rated by other people – NOT in a ‘Hot or Not’ kind
of way but on a deeper level where the results really benefit you. The code
is written in Perl.

We are looking for a Perl programmer who likes the idea of PeopleSeePeople
as much as we do and who is interested in expanding the service and growing
with us.

Required skills: Perl, XSLT, Postgres

Desired skills: Experience with System Administration
