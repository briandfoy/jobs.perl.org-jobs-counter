Job title: Cool Hackers Needed

Company name: athenahealth

Location: United States, MA, Waltham

Pay rate: $40-70K

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
--puzzle-- 

Assume you have an urn of j black beads and k red beads. If you draw out
all the beads with no replacements, what is the probability that you will
not draw out two black beads in a row?

There is a closed-form combinatorial mathematical solution, but coming up
with it may be a bit harder than it sounds; so we'd also be happy if you
can write a perl program that will output the correct probability given j
and k as command-line parameters. If you write your program correctly, you
may even be able to infer the closed-form combinatorial solution.

FYI, nobody from jobs.perl came up with a correct solution to this the last
time we posted this, so this is a bit of a re-challenge. :)

-end puzzle-- 

We're looking for hard-core hackers who love working with people. We still
have a number of positions open, and probably will for some time to come.

You're the kind of person who has always excelled at whatever it is you do,
and can pick up new skills at the drop of a hat. You find it difficult to
turn down a good challenge, and have secretly harbored dreams of either
galactic peace or galactic domination. 

You love working with other excellent people, but are equally comfortable
sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper and molding reality. You know
that you can do the impossible if only you would be given a little bit more
time, but you also know you can accomplish a whole lot more if you work
with trusted colleagues. 

You may not know a lot about healthcare now, but you know that it's badly
broken; that it's some insane percentage of our GDP and growing rapidly;
and that it's a problem that you can get passionate about. 

About athenahealth-- we've been around for about 7 years now, and are
located in Waltham, MA (just outside Boston). We've been backed with $40
million in venture capital from A-list VC's-- VCs who provided some of the
original money behind Apple, Home Depot, Intel, Office Depot, Whole Foods,
etc-- but the company is now on solid ground, and we don't have to raise
any more capital. 

Excellence is rewarded-- how far you go is really up to you. The working
environment is friendly and open. The folks you'll be working with are top
notch, and will probably be some of the best and brightest folks you've
ever worked with regardless of where you're coming from-- Harvard/MIT/CMU
grads, former professors, and just plain smart people who took the road
less traveled.

In terms of the technology platform-- you'll likely be working on Linux
with Oracle, perl/modperl, and Apache, with plenty of DHTML, CSS, and
JavaScript thrown into the mix. But that's not why you'd be coming here; we
believe any hacker worth his/her salt can pick this stuff up in a matter of
a couple of months or so. We're more interested in folks with raw talent
and a burning desire to succeed.

If you're interested, try to come up with a solution to the puzzle above.
Shoot that over with a resume to puzzles@athenahealth.com, and we can start
talking.


Required skills: Perl's good.

Desired skills:
Javascript, DHTML, Oracle, experience with Linux, etc. are also good.
