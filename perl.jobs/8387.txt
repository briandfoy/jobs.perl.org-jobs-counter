Job title: Senior Software Developer

Company name: Wellcome trust Sanger Institute

Internal ID: PERL 1697

Location: United Kingdom, Hinxton, Cambridge

Pay rate: £27,361 to £36,951

Travel: 0-25%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute leads the world in genomic research,
with an expanding scientific programme dedicated to understanding gene
function in health & disease.

Background 
The Cancer Genome Project (CGP) is using Next Generation sequencing
technologies and the reference human genome sequence to screen complete
cancer genomes to identify somatic DNA sequence variations. Using these
technologies will help in providing a comprehensive view of the genetic
alterations that take place in human cancer. For more details see
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/CGP/.

We are developing experimental approaches to analyse complete cancer
genomes using the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD platforms. The
different methods employed can detect mutations of varying size, ranging
from large scale structural rearrangements down to single base-pair
mutations. However, these methods generate vast amounts of raw data that
need to be efficiently processed. Therefore, it is crucial that flexible
and scaleable IT systems are developed to analyse and mine these important
data sets for cancer causing mutations.

Opportunity 
A Software Developer is required to take on the challenge of efficiently
processing, analysing and displaying data from the Next Generation
sequencing platforms. The role involves working closely with scientific/IT
staff on the project to plan and design novel solutions for processing
these data. Strong software engineering skills will then be required to
implement these ideas into flexible, portable and scaleable software
applications.

The position would suit a software developer who enjoys applying their
skills to handling and analysing large biological data sets. We are looking
for an individual who enjoys working in multi-disciplinary team environment
to help solve complex biological problems relating to cancer genetics.


Required skills:
Good degree in Bioinformatics, Computer Science or a Scientific Discipline
and Software engineering skills (using Java, Perl, C++), ORACLE/MySQL
databases. Enjoy working as part of a team.

Desired skills:
UNIX/LINUX development experience. Web development (Perl CGI, Java Struts).
Experience of working on medium-sized software projects. Background and
interest in cancer genetics.
