Location: United Kingdom, Cambridge

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Fixed term contract for 3 year

Hours: Full time

Description:
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute uses large-scale sequencing,
informatics and analysis of genetic variation to understand gene function
in health and disease and to generate resources of lasting value.


Required skills:
Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) is a world leading protein families
database and its use in the scientific community is widespread.  The deluge
of genomic and metagenomics sequencing data has resulted in a substantial
increase in available data that needs to be annotated and made available to
the community. 

Desired skills:

The position involves developing and improving the production pipelines of
the Pfam database, including optimisation of the underlying MySQL and
integration of new features/datasets as they appear.
The successful candidate should have a degree in a biological science (or
relevant experience in the field of Bioinformatics), be computer literate

and optimisation (preferably in MySQL).  Knowledge of Bioinforamatics
tools, OO Perl, LSF, production software development and protein
biochemistry are desirable, but not essential.
