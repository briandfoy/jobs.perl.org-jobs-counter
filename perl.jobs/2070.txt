Description:
 household-name internet information portal is looking for an additional

although this is by no means essential. 
The successful candidate will duly be rewarded with a highly competitive

working on cutting-edge web applications.
Applicants will need to have a valid EU work permit, or EU citizenship, for
this role.

Strong OO, Java or C++, PL/SQL, web technologies (app servers, HTTP etc.),
