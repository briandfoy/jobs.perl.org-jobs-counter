Job title: Perl consultant for mod_perl problem

Location: Anywhere

Pay rate: Negotiable

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: Debug one problem

Hours: Part time

Onsite: no

Description:
We require a Perl consultant to debug a mod_perl problem. The consultant
will assist us in gathering the information required and developing the
fix.
See "Required skills" section for problem details.
Please let us know your experience and rates.
Location is not important, and ability and professional attitude are most
important.

Required skills:
We have a Perl generated web interface running under Apache and mod_perl.
Normally it works fine, however we have found that when running on Ubuntu
14 the following error will randomly happen (eg after a day or two), and
the only way to resolve it so far is to restart Apache.
