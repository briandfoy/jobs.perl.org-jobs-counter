Job title:
Hate your commute? Perl Developer and Sysadmin? Work from home (ideally in
the UK)

Company name: Perl Careers

Location: London, United Kingdom

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Hours: Full time

Onsite: no

Description:
Well-known media client looking for full-stack Perl person with some
sysadmin skills considered a distinct advantage. Small and focused team
looking for another competent problem solver who’s as happy with
DBIx::Class as they are with Apache, and doesn’t get flustered by jQuery.

While they’d love it if you worked in their UK offices, the team is also
setup to be remote. If your commute is getting you down, and you have
better things to do than sacrifice two hours of your precious
CPAN-committing time to the dark altar of Southern Trains, or indeed you
just hate the idea of living close enough to daily commute into London, you
should be all ears...

Desired skills:
This role is for you if:

- You know the difference between apt-get update
and apt-get upgrade
- You have opinions on when you might want to use
Apache over NGINX
- Neither '\dt' nor 'show tables;' scares you
- You know
what the difference between calling ->search() on a resultset in scalar and
array context is
- You can handle CSS and Javascript
