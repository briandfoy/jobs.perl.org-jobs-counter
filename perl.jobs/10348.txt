Job title: Software Developer

Company name: Media Matters for America

Location: United States, DC, Washington

Pay rate: Negotiable

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Salaried employee

Length of employment: Permanent

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Media Matters for America — a progressive, Washington-based, nonprofit
research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring,
analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media —
seeks a Software Developer to assist the Technology Department. This
position is based in our Washington, D.C., office. Applicants must be
prepared to relocate if not living within commuting distance of downtown
D.C.

Working with our current team of developers, the Software Developer will
develop new applications, troubleshoot and bugfix existing tools, and
extend the capabilities of existing software. The Software Developer will
not only work on website features, but also develop and extend internal
applications that include our video acquisition and archival systems,
workflow management software and a variety of internally developed research
tools. Additionally, the Software Developer will be called on to develop
reports on our datasets for various departments within the organization.
The majority of our existing and planned software development uses Perl and
Ruby (RoR). Experience in these languages is required. Occasionally
projects may involve other languages (C, Python, etc.), but prior
professional experience in these languages is not necessary.

The Software Developer will be expected to write and maintain documentation
for any code produced, as well as contribute to processes documentation for
the department. Database-driven development experience is highly desirable,
though extensive database experience is not a requirement. Applicants must
at least be familiar with relational database concepts. All software
development is done within a Linux-based environment, so experience with
that platform is a must.

Required skills:
    *  Professional experience developing software in Perl. C/C++,
Ruby/RoR, Python and other languages a plus.
    * Development experience on Linux platforms.
    * Web development experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including
AJAX frameworks such as jQuery).
    * Familiarity with relational databases, such as PostgreSQL.
    * Experience with version control tools (e.g. Git).
    * Ability to take full ownership of projects and work independently or
as part of a team.
    * Strong organizational skills, and ability to keep track of a wide
range of disparate tasks.
    * Ability to jump into new technologies and quickly learn how to use
them.
    * Willingness to occasionally perform work on evenings and weekends as
the situation warrants.
    * Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar program, or
equivalent work experience.
