Job title: Perl/Java Developer

Company name: Apex Systems, Inc.

Internal ID: Andrew Freundt

Location: United States, VA, Glen Allen

Pay rate: 30-40/hr depending on experience

Travel: 0%

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (hourly)

Length of employment: 6 month contract to hire

Hours: Full time

Onsite: yes

Description:
Perl/Java Developer  with 3-5 years experience.  Must have good
communication and interpersonal skills.  At first the developer will be
working on module related projects.  Must be strong with documentation. He
or she will lay out the technical design (any EDI mapping experience would
be a big plus).  

Developer will be working on a stand alone module.  The application
supports the public-facing servers that receive files from vendors and
return them to trading partners (medical facilities).  This application is
written in perl and they are going to eventually need to rewrite it in
Java.  There will still be Perl components involved with the rewritten
application.

The manager needs someone who can come in and understand the application. 
What this means is that they want someone to come in and support/maintain
this application long enough to understand its capabilities and
functionalities well enough to begin making major enhancements.

Interview Process:

Phone screen first.  Or, if they are local, may just do a face to face
interview.
The technical interview will be next.  A person in Wisconsin will conduct
this phone screen.  
After that, the candidate will come in and do a face to face with the team
lead in Richmond/Glen Allen, VA.

Required skills:
Perl, Java, strong documentation experience

Desired skills:
Perl, Java, and strong documentation experience
