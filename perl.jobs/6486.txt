We're hiring three Perl experts, once has already been found, all must be

will acquire highly sought-after skills that could significantly leverage
your future career. See your work come to life and watch it make money in
the financial markets mere weeks after you finish it!

Responsibilities include:

Ø	implementing trading ideas in Perl according to
detailed specifications but creativeness is welcome within the model
framework

Ø	automating information collection

Ø	test strategies using ready-made Matlab scripts. No previous
statistical knowledge or Matlab experience required

Required skills:
MUST BE FLUENT IN ENGLISH AND BE ABLE TO MOVE TO STOCKHOLM (SWEDEN) WITHOUT
HELP.

Must assume full-time position before 2007-09-30, preferably sooner.

We believe you are:

Ø	enthusiastic, creative, stress tolerant, honest and cheerful

Ø	a good communicator that enjoys independent work with big
responsibilities

Ø	a proven Perl expert with strong mastery of regular expressions.
The founder is only proficient in Perl programming (being a
mathematician/economist). Since your code will manage real money for our
hedge fund clients all trading strategies must be in a language our founder
can understand, i.e. Perl. 

Ø	a Master’s degree or equivalent

Ø	5+ years experience in programming (at least three years Perl)

Ø	genuinely interested in stock trading

Desired skills:
VBA for office and trading experience is appreciated (even simple private
stock investing) but not required.

We kindly ask you to reply to the questions below. A programming task is
sent to qualifying candidates upon receipt of CV, cover letter and answers
to this questionnaire.

For your own sake, answer everything truthfully rather than telling us what
you think we like to hear. There is no single "right" answer.

1) Are you currently employed? Where and for what firm? (This will not be
verified until we are certain to hire you, we respect that you don't want
your current employer to know you're looking for a new job). When is the
earliest you can start your new job?

2) Do you live in Stockholm? If not, where do you live and would you
consider moving?

3) What is your current salary and for how long has it been at this level?
(This will be verified with employer and tax authorities before you begin
at our firm).

4) Would you like to work Saturdays in addition to the normal work week for
20% higher salary? This will not affect your chances of landing an
interview but helps us prepare your salary offer.

5) If given the choice, would you rather work on a single more elegant
(theoretical) solution to a problem or solve and implement many small
problems? Is theory or implementation the more exciting?

6) Do you feel its worthwhile spending 50% more time on getting a project
10% more right?

7) What's the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS? Visit
www.investopedia.com or make a google search. Does the answer interest you
or did it feel like a waste of time?

8) What three things are most important to you about your job?
