on my server or their server and get a test script to work.  I have
installed all the dependencies but I still get errors and none of the
scripts work.

Once you get it working I will need step by step process in which you
accomplished success so that I may be able to replicate it.  I can only pay
if you have success with this module and get the scripts in it to work.
