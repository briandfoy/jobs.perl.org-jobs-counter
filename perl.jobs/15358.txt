Job title: Perl Programer

Company name: OZMOSI

Location: Sea Girt, NJ

Pay rate: $70 USD

Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based)

Hours: Flexible

Onsite: no

Description:
Need support in using prewritten PERL scripts for extracting large amounts
of data from PubMed based on their suggestions below.

We also have the new
edirect package of prewritten PERL scripts which can make this much easier
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/. Download and unarchive
edirect on a UNIX machine and you can do eutils calls with a single command
line. Assuming you have a file of PMC ids in a file called pmcids.txt you
can do the following oneline command command: 

epost -db pmc -id 4662335 |
elink -target pubmed | efetch -db pubmed -format native -mode xml | xtract

monitoring networks: amphibian breeding occupancy across protected areas in
the northeast United States. |Ecology and evolution 5 |Regional monitoring
strategies frequently employ a nested sampling design where a finite set of
study areas from throughout a region are selected and intensive sampling
occurs within a subset of sites within the individual study areas. This
sampling protocol naturally lends itself to a hierarchical analysis to
account for dependence among subsamples. Implementing such an analysis
using a classic likelihood framework is computationally challenging when
accounting for detection errors in species occurrence models. Bayesian
methods offer an alternative approach for fitting models that readily
allows for spatial structure to be incorporated. We demonstrate a general
approach for estimating occupancy when data come from a nested sampling
design. We analyzed data from a regional monitoring program of wood frogs
(Lithobates sylvaticus) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) in
vernal pools using static and dynamic occupancy models. We analyzed
observations from 2004 to 2013 that were collected within 14 protected
areas located throughout the northeast United States. We use the data set
to estimate trends in occupancy at both the regional and individual
protected area levels. We show that occupancy at the regional level was
relatively stable for both species. However, substantial variation occurred
among study areas, with some populations declining and some increasing for
both species. In addition, When the hierarchical study design is not
accounted for, one would conclude stronger support for latitudinal gradient
in trends than when using our approach that accounts for the nested design.
In contrast to the model that does not account for nesting, the nested
model did not include an effect of latitude in the 95% credible interval.
These results shed light on the range-level population status of these
pond-breeding amphibians, and our approach provides a framework that can be
used to examine drivers of local and regional occurrence dynamics. &nbsp;

I recommend
using the "|" symbol as the separator and not a comma because there are
internal commas in the abstracts which will throw the spreadsheet off and
place columns where you do not want them.

Desired skills:
PERL programming and experience setting up a simple set of tasks for other
employees to pull the data in the future.
