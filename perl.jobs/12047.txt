Description:
We are looking for a highly qualified software developer with familiarity
with bioinformatics and a genuine interest in complex biological databases
to participate in the FlyBase genome database project group at Harvard
University, Cambridge.	The successful candidate will collaborate in
developing and maintaining database applications for acquisition,
formatting, and integration of diverse datasets into FlyBase, and in
developing analytical tools for the investigation of these datasets.
FlyBase is one of the premier "model organism" databases, focusing on
genomic and genetic data on the fruit fly, Drosophila (http://flybase.org/)
including many new Next_Generation sequencing-based high throughput
datasets.  The Harvard FlyBase is the central site of this international

Experience with perl in a UNIX environment is essential, and a working
knowledge of java would be advantageous. The ideal candidate will have
strong collaborative skills, broad experience using bioinformatics
resources, and an established background in scientific software development
using common open resources such as bioperl in the production of reusable
software components suitable for open distribution.
