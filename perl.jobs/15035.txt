As a programmer at pair Networks, you'll be building the tools that our
customers use to build the Internet. This entry level position emphasizes
completion of well-defined tasks within a limited time frame and with
limited autonomy. We require you to be able to work as a part of a team,
manage your time across multiple tasks, and communicate effectively with
other programmers and with customer support staff.

This is a full stack programming position, working with a large existing
code base. An ability to read, understand, and modify existing code without
introducing bugs is essential.

Some training in internal systems and procedures will be provided, but most
of your learning will be self-directed. Willingness and ability to learn
required skills as needed is more important than already having all the
skills listed below. Opportunities for advancement in the department depend
on your growth within the position.

Required skills:
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience

Desired skills:
Perl
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
