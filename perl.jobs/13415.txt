Description:
We are developing a calendar and scheduling application using Perl,

have an office in Tacloban City and Mandaue City, but telecommuters are
welcome.

Developers will work with US counterparts to design and develop the
application based on functional specifications. We primarily use Trac and
email for communication. Projects undergo code reviews and QA prior to
release.

Ideal applicants will have plenty of experience with relevant technologies
and some system administration skills and must be comfortable working over
SSH.

This is a long-term contract position that may turn into a salaried
position w/ benefits.

preferred.
